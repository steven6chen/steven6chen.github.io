With regard to salicylate renal excretion, salicylate that is not reabsorbed from the filtrate is thus eliminated in the urine. The urinary excretion of aspirin has been shown to be significantly correlated with urinary pH, with increased excretion associated with increases in urine pH.<sup>1</sup> In support of these observations, several reports have described decreased serum salicylate concentrations with concurrent use of antacids, which can produce an alkaline urine, increasing the urinary excretion of salicylates.<sup>2,3,4</sup> Based on these data and the excretion properties of the salicylates, it is expected that concurrent use with an agent that acidifies the urine, such as ammonium chloride,<sup>5</sup> would conversely result in an increase in serum salicylate concentrations and to potentially greater physiologic salicylate effects.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Pgp is believed to perform several functions in the body, but given its distribution in the body and its action as mostly an efflux transporter, its primary role appears to be body/tissue defense against drugs and other chemicals. For example, Pgp transports substances across membranes into the intestine (limiting absorption), into the bile and urine (increasing excretion), and out of the brain and gonads (limiting distribution). Pgp does not metabolize or alter the substrates with which it interacts, but simply move the substrates to new locations, thus presenting the substrates to existing metabolic processes. For example, by transporting unmetabolized substrates back into the intestinal lumen, Pgp essentially gives intestinal CYP3A additional opportunities to metabolize compounds that are substrates of both Pgp and CYP3A.<sup>3</sup><br><br>A number of structurally and functionally diverse drugs serve as substrates for Pgp (eg, digoxin, loperamide, and vinblastine).<sup>1,4</sup> In addition, a number of drugs can either induce or inhibit Pgp. Pgp inducers increase the amount and/or activity of Pgp, generally leading to decreased absorption, enhanced elimination, and limited distribution of Pgp substrates.<br><br>Understanding whether a drug is transported by Pgp and/or whether a drug is a Pgp inducer or inhibitor can assist in identifying potential drug interactions. For example, adding rifampin or St. Johns wort (Pgp inducers) to digoxin (a Pgp substrate) can lead to decreased digoxin concentrations.<sup>5,6</sup><br><br>It is important to remember, however, that such predictions are limited in the following ways: 1) drug concentration, distribution, and response may be controlled by many factors (e.g., Pgp transport, cytochrome P450 metabolism, etc.), offering a drug an alternative elimination route should one be blocked; 2) the sum of multiple drug effects on Pgp is unknown; 3) Pgp expression and activity is affected by a number of factors other than drug entities (e.g., inflammation, stress hormones, irradiation, etc.);<sup>7,8,9</sup> and 4) Pgp expression and activity in one cell/tissue does not necessarily correlate with that in other tissues,<sup>7</sup> meaning that changes (e.g., induction) in intestinal Pgp, for example, may not reflect changes in lymphocyte or renal Pgp.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Specific recommendations may vary considerably among individual P-gp inhibitors, and the recommendations for management of these potential drug interactions depend on the indication for dabigatran use, patient renal function, and country specific labeling recommendations.<br><br>The dabigatran U.S. prescribing information does not recommend any specific dose reductions or contraindications with P-gp inhibitors for patients with normal renal function. In patients taking dabigatran for atrial fibrillation for those with moderate renal dysfunction (CrCl 30-50 mL/min), dabigatran dose should be reduced to 75 mg twice/day with the P-gp inhibitors ketoconazole or dronedarone (does not apply to other P-gp inhibitors). In patients with estimated creatinine clearance over 50 mL/min taking dronedarone for DVT or PE prophylaxis following hip replacement surgery, consider separating doses of dabigatran several hours from doses of ketoconazole or dronedarone. Concurrent use of dabigatran with any P-gp inhibitors should be avoided in patients with severe renal dysfunction (CrCl 15-30 ml/min).

With concurrent use of verapamil, consider a further dabigatran dose reduction to 75 mg once/day in patients with moderate renal dysfunction. Also unique to verapamil is the recommendation that dabigatran etexilate doses be given at least 2 hours prior to any oral verapamil dose (regardless of indication for which dabigatran is being used).

In contrast, erythromycin or clarithromycin use was associated with a 40% decrease in the incidence rate ratio for major bleeding, and use of cyclosporine, dronedarone, itraconazole, ketoconazole, or verapamil - all recognized P-gp inhibitors - was not associated with any significant increase or decrease in major bleeding. Of note, several other examined combinations in this cohort study yielded findings contrary to what would be expected based on available pharmacokinetic interaction data or known pharmacology of the drugs in question. The precise clinical meaning of these findings is unclear.<br><br>Dabigatran AUC and Cmax were increased an average of 138% and 135%, respectively, when given after a single dose of ketoconazole (400 mg).<sup>2</sup> Following multiple days of ketoconazole (400 mg/day), the average increases in dabigatran AUC and Cmax were 153% and 149%, respectively. Concurrent verapamil was associated with up to a 2.4-fold increase in dabigatran concentrations, though this effect appeared to be highly dependent on the timing of verapamil (immediate-release) administration, with the interaction primarily limited to administration of verapamil prior to dabigatran.<sup>2</sup> Dabigatran AUC and Cmax were increased by an average of 53% and 56%, respectively, with concurrent quinidine (200 mg every 2 hours x 5 doses).<sup>2</sup> Concomitant administration with amiodarone resulted in a 58% increase in dabigatran (active drug) AUC and a 50% increase in dabigatran Cmax.<sup>2,3</sup> Amiodarone has also been reported to increase the renal clearance of dabigatran.<sup>2</sup> Dabigatran AUC was increased 2.6-fold when combined with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (400 mg/100 mg/200 mg),<sup>4</sup> and increased 2.4-fold when combined with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.<sup>5</sup><br><br>In contrast to these reports, a study with the P-gp inhibitor clarithromycin reported only a minor impact of concurrent therapy on dabigatran concentrations (AUC and Cmax increased an average of 15% and 19%, respectively).<sup>3</sup><br><br>Dabigatran labeling notes that the prodrug (dabigatran etexilate) is a substrate with moderate affinity for the P-gp transport system, suggesting that the mechanism for these observed interactions is inhibition of P-gp resulting in increased dabigatran concentrations.<sup>2</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Pgp is believed to perform several functions in the body, but given its distribution in the body and its action as mostly an efflux transporter, its primary role appears to be body/tissue defense against drugs and other chemicals. For example, Pgp transports substances across membranes into the intestine (limiting absorption), into the bile and urine (increasing excretion), and out of the brain and gonads (limiting distribution). Pgp does not metabolize or alter the substrates with which it interacts, but simply move the substrates to new locations, thus presenting the substrates to existing metabolic processes. For example, by transporting unmetabolized substrates back into the intestinal lumen, Pgp essentially gives intestinal CYP3A additional opportunities to metabolize compounds that are substrates of both Pgp and CYP3A.<sup>3</sup><br><br>A number of structurally and functionally diverse drugs serve as substrates for Pgp (eg, digoxin, loperamide, and vinblastine).<sup>1,4</sup> In addition, a number of drugs can either induce or inhibit Pgp. Pgp inhibitors will decrease Pgp activity , generally leading to increased absorption, decreased elimination, and enhanced distribution of Pgp substrates, possibly resulting in greater substrate effects/toxicity.<br><br>Understanding whether a drug is transported by Pgp and/or whether a drug is a Pgp inhibitor or inducer can assist in identifying potential drug interactions. For example, adding clarithromycin (a Pgp inhibitor) to digoxin (a Pgp substrate) can lead to marked elevations in serum digoxin concentrations.<sup>5,6</sup><br><br>It is important to remember, however, that such predictions are limited in the following ways: 1) drug concentration, distribution, and response may be controlled by many factors (e.g., Pgp transport, cytochrome P450 metabolism, etc.), offering a drug an alternative elimination route should one be blocked; 2) the sum of multiple drug effects on Pgp is unknown; 3) Pgp expression and activity is affected by a number of factors other than drug entities (e.g., inflammation, stress hormones, irradiation, etc.);<sup>7,8,9</sup> and 4) Pgp expression and activity in one cell/tissue does not necessarily correlate with that in other tissues,<sup>7</sup> meaning that changes (e.g., inhibition) in intestinal Pgp, for example, may not reflect changes in lymphocyte or renal Pgp.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

In contrast, erythromycin or clarithromycin use was associated with a 40% decrease in the incidence rate ratio for major bleeding, and use of cyclosporine, dronedarone, itraconazole, ketoconazole, or verapamil - all recognized P-gp inhibitors - was not associated with any significant increase or decrease in major bleeding. Of note, several other combinations examined in this cohort study yielded findings contrary to what would be expected based on available pharmacokinetic interaction data or known pharmacology of the drugs in question. The precise clinical meaning of these findings is unclear.<br><br>In a clinical study summarized in rivaroxaban US and Canadian product labeling, concomitant use of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor atorvastatin had no significant impact on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetic variables in healthy volunteers.<sup>2,3,4</sup> Of note, trough rivaroxaban concentrations were an average of 6.5-fold higher with concurrent cyclosporine (a P-gp inhibitor and a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor) than with concurrent tacrolimus in a small study of 9 post-liver transplant patients (5 receiving cyclosporine and 4 receiving tacrolimus).<sup>5</sup><br><br>Rivaroxaban is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, and its elimination is partially renally-dependent.<sup>2</sup> Several studies have described increased rivaroxaban exposure when more than one of these pathways is impaired. Concurrent use of ketoconazole or ritonavir, both strong CYP3A4 inhibitors that inhibit P-glycoprotein, increased rivaroxaban AUC by 2.6- and 2.5-fold, respectively.<sup>2</sup> Concurrent use of clarithromycin, another strong CYP3A4 inhibitor that inhibits P-glycoprotein, increased rivaroxaban AUC by 1.5-fold.<sup>2</sup> The moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-glycoprotein inhibitor erythromycin increased rivaroxaban AUC by only 1.3-fold.<sup>2,3</sup> However, coadministration of erythromycin in subjects with renal impairment classified as mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 79 mL/min) or moderate (estimated creatinine clearance 30 to 49 mL/min) increased the rivaroxaban AUC to approximately 1.8 and 2 times greater, respectively, than the AUC seen in subjects with normal renal function (estimated creatinine clearance &gt; 80 mL/min) not receiving erythromycin.<sup>2</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

If this combination is used, monitor patients closely for response to busulfan and monitor busulfan and phenytoin concentrations as appropriate. For seizure prophylaxis that does not use phenytoin (or another enzyme-inducing antiepileptic), note that busulfan clearance may be decreased and busulfan exposure (AUC) may be increased, relative to phenytoin-containing regimens. Monitor such patients closely for evidence of excessive busulfan toxicity.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> In a study comparing busulfan pharmacokinetics after dose 16 with those after dose 1, the busulfan clearance was an average of 19% higher following dose 16 among those who received concurrent phenytoin.<sup>1</sup> Similarly, the average busulfan AUC and half-life were 16.5% and 23% lower, respectively, after dose 16 among those receiving concurrent phenytoin. Of note, 4 of the 7 patients receiving phenytoin experienced continuously decreased busulfan steady-state concentrations. These changes in busulfan pharmacokinetics were not seen a control group (n=10) that received diazepam instead of phenytoin.<br><br>Concurrent phenytoin was found to significantly correlate with the oral clearance of busulfan in another study of patients receiving busulfan prior to a bone marrow transplant.<sup>2</sup> From this analysis, phenytoin use was associated with an approximate 21% increase in busulfan oral clearance. These data are similar to the statement in the busulfan prescribing information that says concurrent phenytoin has been associated with a 15% or greater increase in busulfan clearance.<sup>3,4</sup><br><br>Somewhat in conflict with these other reports, a comparison of busulfan-treated patients receiving clonazepam as seizure prophylaxis (n=24) to patients who had previously receiving phenytoin prophylaxis (n=127) concluded that the average busulfan clearance was non-significantly higher (by approximately 10%) with concurrent clonazepam.<sup>5</sup> Given the enzyme-inducing potential of phenytoin (and no such expected effect with clonazepam), this finding was unexpected and questions the degree to which phenytoin had impacted busulfan clearance in those phenytoin-treated patients.<br><br>The mechanism for this possible interaction is increased busulfan metabolism via the enzyme-inducing effects of phenytoin. Considering the role for glutathione-S-transferase in the metabolism of busulfan, it is suspected that phenytoin induction of this enzyme is primarily responsible for the observed/predicted interaction.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

According to pimozide prescribing information, 2 sudden deaths have been reported following the addition of clarithromycin to patients receiving pimozide.<sup>2</sup> In vitro studies showed that pimozide was primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 isoenzymes, and that CYP3A inhibiors such as clarithromycin and ketoconazole could significantly inhibit such metabolism.<sup>3,4</sup> Pimozide prescribing information cautions that pimozide should not be used with any inhibitors of CYP3A4, including less potent inhibitors (e.g., zileuton).<sup>2</sup><br><br>Of note, the description of zileuton as a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor seems unsupported by available data.

An INR measured 4 days after completion of amoxicillin/clavulanate was 2.55. Similarly, another case report describes a 75-year-old patient, who had been previously stable on warfarin, presented with increasingly severe abdominal pain and an INR of 5.7 three days after completing a 7-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanate for a lower respiratory tract infection.<sup>2</sup> A diagnosis of rectus sheath hematoma was made, and it was concluded that an interaction between warfarin and amoxicillin/clavulanate was the cause. Another case report describes a patient receiving both warfarin and amoxicillin who exhibited persistent bleeding that was unusually nonresponsive to tranexamic acid rinses following a tooth extraction.<sup>3</sup> The authors of this report attributed this unusual bleeding to excessive anticoagulation due to an interaction between warfarin and amoxicillin.<br><br>In a large nested case control study of 2,553 patients treated with the vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon who were hospitalized for hemorrhage in Germany, concurrent use of amoxicillin/clavulanate was associated with a nearly 3-fold increase in odds for a serious bleed.<sup>4</sup> Similarly, other case-control and cohort studies of the phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol users have reported a generally similar 3-fold increase in the risk for bleeding associated with concurrent use of penicillins (mostly attributed to amoxicillin and/or amoxicillin/clavulanate).<sup>5,6</sup><br><br>In contrast, a crossover study of 12 patients stabilized on warfarin revealed no change in INR following a 7-day course of concurrent amoxicillin/clavulanate (versus placebo).<sup>7</sup> Another study reviewed 2,151 patients over 66 years of age who were hospitalized for upper gastrointestinal bleeds (UGI) while taking a urinary tract anti-infective concurrently with warfarin.<sup>8</sup> No significant association was observed with amoxicillin or ampicillin and UGI bleeds (adjusted odds ratio: 1.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.92-2.05).<br><br>The specific mechanism for this potential interaction is not certain, but one common theory is that broad spectrum antimicrobials (and particularly those with activity against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and/or <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> species) such as amoxicillin/clavulanate may eradicate intestinal microbes (e.g., <i>E. coli</i>, <i>B. fragilis</i>, etc.) responsible for the production of vitamin K precursors (i.e., menaquinones).<sup>1,2,4,9,10</sup> Depleted vitamin K stores then result in hypoprothrombinemia, even without concurrent therapy with warfarin or another vitamin K antagonist. This mechanism has been proposed for other broad spectrum antibiotics including but not limited to tetracyclines and cephalosporins including cefazolin, cefoxitin, and ceftriaxone. Another proposed explanation is the preferential hepatic metabolism of clavulanate over warfarin.<sup>2</sup> This may lead to increased serum concentrations of warfarin and a subsequent increase in INR.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
