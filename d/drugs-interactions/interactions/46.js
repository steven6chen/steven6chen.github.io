An in vitro study also supports a possible omeprazole-acenocoumarol interaction, reporting that omeprazole decreased acenocoumarol metabolism.<sup>6</sup> In contrast, concurrent omeprazole (40 mg daily x 3 days) was not associated with any significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic differences in acenocoumarol response in a clinical study of 8 healthy volunteers,<sup>9</sup> and a retrospective review of 118 patients receiving acenocoumarol and omeprazole found no evidence of a clinically significant interaction.<sup>10</sup><br><br>The suspected mechanism of this interaction is omeprazole-mediated inhibition of R-warfarin metabolism via CYP2C19. R-warfarin is the less potent of the 2 warfarin enantiomers (S-warfarin is about 5-6 times more potent), and is metabolized primarily by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, though other enzymes may also be involved to some extent. Like all available proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), omeprazole is a substrate of both CYP2C19 (primarily) and CYP3A, with in vitro data showing that omeprazole is capable of inhibiting CYP2C19 to at least some extent (though in vivo data confirming these findings are somewhat conflicting, but generally stronger for omeprazole than for most other PPIs).<sup>11,12</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Also, patients who were intermediate metabolizers of CYP2C19 genotype were found to have an increase incidence of bleeding than other CYP2C19 genotypes with the concurrent use of lansoprazole and warfarin.<sup>1</sup> These findings are somewhat in agreement with the findings with omperazole, another proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which has been associated with increased anticoagulant effects in one case report,<sup>3</sup> and with decreased R-warfarin metabolism (and increased R-warfarin concentrations) in several in vivo and in vitro studies.<sup>4,5,6,7,8,9</sup><br><br>With respect to the vitamin K antagonist acenocoumarol, the use of lansoprazole use was associated with an increased risk of overcoagulation (i.e., INR over 6) in acenocoumarol-treated patients [HR=1.49 (95% CI: 1.05 to 2.10)] in an observational cohort study of 2755 patients.<sup>10</sup> Esomeprazole was the only PPI with a greater risk in the study, and other PPIs had a lower and non-statistically significant risk.<br><br>The suspected mechanism of any possible interaction is inhibition of R-warfarin metabolism via CYP2C19. R-warfarin is the less potent of the 2 warfarin enantiomers (S-warfarin is about 5-6 times more potent), and is metabolized primarily by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, though other enzymes may also be involved to some extent. All available PPIs are substrates of both CYP2C19 (primarily) and CYP3A, with in vitro data showing that all PPIs are also capable of inhibiting CYP2C19 to at least some extent (with lansoprazole being one of most potent inhibitors in vitro), though in vivo data confirming these findings are lacking for most PPIs.<sup>11,12</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Of note, at least 2 patients in this study were taking other drugs capable of inhibiting sildenafil metabolism, possibly blunting the magnitude of this possible interaction to a small degree. Similarly, a study of healthy volunteers (n=55) reported a 63% decrease in sildenafil AUC following concurrent sildenafil (80mg TID) and bosentan (125mg BID).<sup>2</sup> Conversely, bosentan AUC was increased by an average of 50%, and bosentan maximum plasma concentration was increased by an average of 42% by concurrent sildenafil. A study with the phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor tadalafil found a similar two-way interaction with bosentan. Tadalafil AUC was 41% lower, while bosentan AUC was 13% higher, with 10 days of concurrent tadalafil (40mg daily) and bosentan (125mg BID) in a study of 15 healthy volunteers.<sup>3</sup><br><br>The mechanism by which bosentan appears to lower concentrations of PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil and tadalafil is via induction of CYP3A4, leading to increased drug clearance.<sup>1,2,3,4</sup> CYP3A4 is the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil.<sup>5,6,7</sup> The mechanism by which the PDE5 inhibitors increase bosentan concentrations is uncertain. Bosentan is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4,<sup>4</sup> so competitive inhibition by the PDE5 inhibitors is one possible mechanism, though none of the PDE5 inhibitors are known to be potent inhibitors of either of these enzymes. Another possible mechanism involves inhibition of hepatic uptake of bosentan (and/or its active metabolite) by the uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OAT1B3, which have been shown to be inhibited to at least some degree by sildenafil, though at concentrations greater than those usually observed clinically.<sup>8</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Despite a decrease in sirolimus dose (from 7mg/day to 5mg/day), sirolimus concentrations increased more than 2-fold in one patient following the initiation of itraconazole (200mg BID).<sup>2</sup> Another report describes a patient who required a doubling of their sirolimus dose (from 0.75mg/day to 1.5mg/day) following a change from itraconazole (400mg/day) to amphotericin B.<sup>3</sup><br><br>The likely mechanism of this interaction is itraconazole inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and/or p-glycoprotein transport of sirolimus. Of note, a study in rats finding that ketoconazole increased the sirolimus AUC by 3-5-fold questioned the role of p-glycoprotein inhibition in this interaction, and suggesting the involvement of an unknown mechanism, including the possible involvement of another sirolimus transporter.<sup>4</sup> Interestingly, other data support the possible involvement of a novel transporter (i.e., besides p-glycoprotein) in sirolimus disposition.<sup>5</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
