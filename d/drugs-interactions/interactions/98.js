Use of lower aspirin doses or only occasional aspirin use was still associated with an increase in risk for UGIB when combined with any level of alcohol consumption (2.8 [2.1 to 3.8] and 2.4 [1.9 to 3.0], respectively).<sup>1</sup> Similarly, in another case control study of 1,217 patients, use of aspirin or alcohol was associated with an increased risk of GI bleed (2- to 2.7-fold), and the combination conferred an even greater additive risk.<sup>2</sup> One other case control study of 817 patients hospitalized with a GI bleed reported that the combination of aspirin and alcohol consumption increased the risk for GI bleeding greater than either therapy alone.<sup>3</sup> Several case reports also describe bleeding events in patients thought to be due to the combination of aspirin and alcohol.<sup>4,5,6</sup> Additionally, compared with aspirin alone, the combination of aspirin and alcohol has been reported to increase fecal occult blood loss<sup>7,8,9,10</sup> and increase endoscopic GI mucosal damage.<sup>11</sup><br> <br>In support of these studies, a study of 9 healthy subjects coadministered aspirin 325 mg and ethanol 125 mL (50 g) found that bleeding times were significantly prolonged when compared to baseline.<sup>12,13</sup> Ethanol alone had no effect on bleeding time, aspirin alone prolonged bleeding time, and the combination of aspirin and alcohol resulted in a further prolongation of bleeding time.<sup>12,13</sup> Another confirmatory study found prolonged bleeding times with the combination,<sup>14</sup> and in vitro studies have suggested that the combination of aspirin and alcohol may reduce platelet activation.<sup>15,16</sup>. <br><br>In addition to the pharmacodynamic interaction between aspirin and alcohol, a pharmacokinetic interaction has been evaluated in several studies with conflicting results.<sup>12,17,18,19,20</sup> In one study of 5 healthy volunteers, aspirin (1,000 mg single dose) increased the alcohol (0.3 g/kg single dose) maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and AUC 39% and 29%, respectively.<sup>17</sup> Another study showed similar results.<sup>20</sup> In contrast, in a study of 10 healthy volunteers, aspirin (75 mg daily x 7 days) decreased the alcohol (0.3 g/kg single dose) Cmax and AUC 23%.<sup>19</sup> And in additional studies, aspirin was reported to have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of alcohol.<sup>12,18</sup><br> <br>Prescribing information for aspirin states that patients who consume 3 or more alcoholic drinks every day may have an increased risk of bleeding.<sup>21,22</sup> Additionally, the prescribing information for extended-release aspirin states that because alcohol can interfere with the controlled release properties of the extended-release aspirin product, alcohol should not be consumed at the time of extended-release aspirin administration.<sup>22</sup> Extended-release aspirin should be administered 2 hours before, or 1 hour after, alcohol consumption.<sup>22</sup><br> <br>The mechanism of the pharmacodynamic interaction has not been fully characterized, but because aspirin, and possibly alcohol, affect platelet function and bleeding risk, their combined use may be additive.<sup>23,24</sup> The mechanism of the pharmacokinetic the interaction is unknown, but aspirin may inhibit alcohol metabolism.<sup>20,25</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

No other phenytoin pharmacokinetic parameters were altered, but phenobarbital use was allowed during the study and may have confounded some results. Several case reports and one small pharmacokinetic analysis (N=2) reported 2.3- to 5.4-fold increases in serum phenytoin concentrations with symptoms of phenytoin toxicity (eg, nystagmus, ataxia, lethargy) when chloramphenicol therapy was added to patients on stable phenytoin doses.<sup>2,3,4,5,6</sup> <br><br>Reports describing the effect of phenytoin on the pharmacokinetics of chloramphenicol are less numerous and variable. One case report describes a pediatric patient who experienced a 46% and 74% reduction in chloramphenicol peak and trough concentrations, respectively, 2 days after initiation of phenytoin therapy.<sup>7</sup> Conversely, another report describes 6 pediatric patients taking phenytoin who had chloramphenicol peak and trough levels that were 65% and 98% higher, respectively, than 17 patients who received chloramphenicol without phenytoin therapy.<sup>8</sup> <br><br>The mechanism for increased phenytoin concentrations and toxicity seen in the presence of chloramphenicol therapy has not been fully described. However, chloramphenicol inhibition of the CYP enzymes responsible for phenytoin metabolism is a likely mechanism.<sup>9</sup> The mechanism(s) by which phenytoin may affect chloramphenicol pharmacokinetics is unknown. The induction of CYP enzymes responsible for chloramphenicol metabolism may explain the reduction in chloramphenicol concentrations seen with the addition of phenytoin.

Case reports and clinical studies have reported associations between concurrent loop diuretics and aminoglycosides and nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity.<sup>1,2,3</sup> Similarly, animal studies have also reported associations between nephrotoxicity/ototoxicity and concurrent use of a loop diuretic and an aminoglycoside.<sup>4,5</sup> One clinical study found an association between concurrent furosemide and aminoglycoside-associated nephrotoxicity in an analysis considering only these factors, but the association became not significant when controlling for other risk factors.<sup>6</sup> Several clinical studies have also reported no association between nephro- or ototoxicity and concurrent aminoglycosides and loop diuretics.<sup>7,8,9</sup><br><br>Higher loop diuretic doses, low serum albumin concentrations, and younger-aged patients have been identified as possible risk factors for loop diuretic toxicity.<sup>10,11</sup> Due to the possible increase in risk for ototoxicity, the prescribing information for several loop diuretics recommend avoiding concomitant use with aminoglycosides,<sup>12,13,14</sup> though some state that concomitant use may be employed in life-threatening conditions.<sup>12,13</sup> Prescribing information for inhaled tobramycin states that typical tobramcyin serum concentrations do not exceed 1 ng/mL, but diuretics may alter tobramycin concentrations and increase the risk for nephro- or ototoxicity.<sup>15</sup><br><br>The mechanism(s) for this possible interaction is uncertain, but several possibly contributing factors have been identified.

In patients who are also receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, avoid the use of both inhibitors in patients using the 662 mg, 882 mg, or 1,064 mg doses of aripirazole lauroxil; no dose adjustment is required, however, for patients receiving the 441 mg dose if it is being tolerated. No dose adjustment is required for patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.</p>\n<div>\n <p><b>CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Strong) Interacting Members</b> FLUoxetine, PARoxetine, QuiNIDine, Tipranavir</p>\n</div> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Data with the prodrug aripiprazole lauroxil are not specifically available concerning this interaction, but much of the labeled warnings are based on data with the active product aripiprazole.<sup>1,2</sup><br><br>Concomitant administration of aripiprazole (10 mg single dose) with the strong CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine (166 mg/day for 13 days) increased aripiprazole AUC by 112% and decreased the AUC of dehydroaripiprazole (active metabolite) by 35%.<sup>1</sup> Similarly, patients considered CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have roughly 80% greater aripiprazole exposure and 30% lower dehydroaripiprazole exposure.<sup>1</sup> In a study of Japanese males genotyped as extensive or intermediate CYP2D6 metabolizers, administration of aripiprazole (3 mg single dose) with the strong CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine (20mg/day for 21 days) increased aripiprazole AUC by 140% in extensive metabolizers and by 30% in intermediate metabolizers compared to administration of aripiprazole alone.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Aripiprazole is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and dehydroaripiprazole is metabolized by CYP3A4. The CYP-mediated metabolism of aripiprazole is likely decreased by strong inhibitors of both of these enzymes, and that of dehydroaripiprazole by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Patients receiving CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, quinidine) or who are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers and receiving aripiprazole with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may be at even greater risk of toxicity, as both primary metabolic pathways would be impaired in these individuals. Aripiprazole lauroxil prescribing information recommends decreased doses under some circumstances.<sup>2</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1. Abilify (aripiprazole) [prescribing information].

Any use of such a combination should be performed with close monitoring for evidence of serotonin toxicity.</p>\n<div>\n <p><b>Serotonin Modulators Interacting Members</b> 5-Hydroxytryptophan, Almotriptan, Amitriptyline, Amoxapine, Bromocriptine, BusPIRone, Cabergoline, Citalopram, ClomiPRAMINE, Cyclobenzaprine, Dapoxetine, Desipramine, Desvenlafaxine, Dextromethorphan, Dihydroergotamine, Dosulepin, Doxepin (Systemic), Doxepin (Topical), DULoxetine, Eletriptan, Ergoloid Mesylates, Ergonovine, Ergotamine, Escitalopram, FentaNYL, FLUoxetine, FluvoxaMINE, Frovatriptan, Imipramine, Isocarboxazid, Levomilnacipran, Linezolid, Lithium, Lofepramine, Lorcaserin, Maprotiline, Melitracen [INT], Meperidine, Methadone, Methylene Blue, Methylergonovine, Milnacipran, Mirtazapine, Moclobemide, Naratriptan, Nefazodone, Nortriptyline, PARoxetine, Pergolide, Phenelzine, Procarbazine, Promethazine, Protriptyline, Rasagiline, Rizatriptan, Safinamide, SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine), Selegiline, Sertraline, St John's Wort, SUMAtriptan, Tapentadol, Tedizolid, TraMADol, Tranylcypromine, TraZODone, Trimipramine, Tryptophan, Venlafaxine, Vilazodone, Vortioxetine, ZOLMitriptan<br><b>Exception</b> Nicergoline</p>\n</div> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> The metaxalone prescribing information warns that caution is advised with any concurrent use of metaxalone with serotonin modulators due to the potential for serotonin syndrome.<sup>1</sup> <br><br>Several published case reports describe patients who developed serotonin syndrome associated with metaxalone.<sup>2,3,4</sup> Although the concurrent use of serotonin modulators (paroxetine, escitalopram, tramadol, and venlafaxine) may have been a contributing factor in many of these cases, every case also involved a metaxalone overdose or disease-related increase in metaxalone concentrations.<br><br>The extent to which metaxalone alters serotonin concentrations and/or function is uncertain. The metaxalone mechanism of action is unclear, but authors of the case reports have hypothesized that metaxalone may work in part by serotonin modulation and/or via some degree of monoamine oxidase inhibition.<sup>2,3</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
