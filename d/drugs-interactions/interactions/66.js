Aripiprazole pharmacokinetics were also evaluated with or without concomitant itraconazole in these subjects based on CYP2D6 genotype. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole and itraconazole in subjects classified as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers increased aripiprazole AUC by ~42%.<sup>2</sup> <br><br>In 13 Japanese males identified as extensive or intermediate CYP2D6 metabolizers, coadministration of aripiprazole (3 mg single dose) with the weak CYP3A4 inhibitor fluvoxamine (100 mg/day), decreased aripiprazole clearance (~40%) and increased aripiprazole AUC (~63-65%) and half-life (~44-49%) similarly between CYP2D6 genotypes, compared to aripiprazole alone. Dehydroaripiprazole AUC and half-life both increased by ~2-fold in extensive metabolizers during the fluvoxamine phase.<sup>3</sup> A case report describes supratherapeutic aripiprazole levels and symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in a 43 year old HIV-positive male receiving aripiprazole (50 mg/day) concomitantly with duloxetine (60 mg/day) and antiretroviral therapy that included darunavir/ritonavir (800 mg/100 mg daily).<sup>4</sup> <br><br>Aripiprazole is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and dehydroaripiprazole is metabolized by CYP3A4.

Patients receiving CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, quinidine) or who are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers and receiving aripiprazole with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may be at even greater risk of toxicity, as both primary metabolic pathways would be impaired in these individuals.

In patients already maintained on these combinations, and when boceprevir is used in combination with other ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitor regimens, discuss with patients the potential for reduced concentrations/effectiveness of both the HIV protease inhibitor and boceprevir. Monitor both HIV and HCV antiviral response closely. It is unclear if the use of boceprevir with ritonavir alone (i.e., without any other HIV protease inhibitor) results in as significant an interaction. Avoid any use of cobicistat-boosted darunavir or atazanavir with boceprevir.</p>\n<div>\n <p><b>Protease Inhibitors Interacting Members</b> Atazanavir, Darunavir, Fosamprenavir, Indinavir, Lopinavir, Nelfinavir, Ritonavir, Saquinavir, Tipranavir</p>\n</div> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> According to data in an FDA safety announcement, concurrent use of boceprevir with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with average reductions in atazanavir, lopinavir, and darunavir minimum serum concentrations (Cmin) of 49%, 43%, and 59%, respectively.<sup>1</sup> Similarly, the average AUCs for atazanavir, lopinavir, and darunavir were reduced by 34-44%. The average boceprevir AUC was reduced by 45% with concurrent ritonavir/lopinavir and by 32% with ritonavir-boosted darunavir, whereas concurrent ritonavir-boosted atazanavir was not associated with a significant change in boceprevir AUC.<sup>1</sup> In a clinical study summarized in boceprevir prescribing information, coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg daily for 12 days) decreased the maximum concentration and AUC of boceprevir (400 mg 3 times daily for 15 days) by 27% and 19%, respectively.<sup>2</sup><br><br>An April, 2012 FDA statement announced that boceprevir prescribing information would be updated with a warning that coadministration of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir with boceprevir is not recommended in patients with HIV and chronic HCV co-infection.<sup>2,3</sup> The statement also discussed some preliminary results from a clinical trial that indicated that individuals receiving one of these ritonavir-boosted regimens or raltegravir for HIV infection had a higher rate of undetectable HCV viral load 12 weeks after completing a boceprevir/peginterferon/ribavirin regimen compared to a peginterferon/ribavirin regimen without boceprevir.<sup>3</sup> HIV virologic rebound in this study was actually less common in boceprevir/peginterferon/ribavirin treated patients than in peginterferon/ribavirin treated patients (3/64 [4.7%] vs. 4/34 [11.8%]). Although the combination of fosamprenavir/ritonavir and boceprevir has not been evaluated in a clinical study, due to the results with other ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors, prescribing information for fosamprenavir recommends to avoid the concomitant use of fosamprenavir/ritonavir and boceprevir.<sup>4</sup><br><br>The specific mechanism by which boceprevir reduces ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitor concentrations is unclear. Boceprevir is described as a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 and a potential inhibitor of p-glycoprotein, as well as not being an inducer of most drug-metabolizing enzymes.<sup>2</sup> The interaction may therefore more likely be the result of boceprevir interference with ritonavir boosting effects (e.g., via competition for CYP3A binding/inhibition) than actual induction of metabolism of the boosted protease inhibitor. The mechanism(s) by which ritonavir and/or ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors reduce boceprevir concentrations is uncertain but may be due to induction of the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of boceprevir, which is partly dependent on CYP3A for its metabolism.<sup>2</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
