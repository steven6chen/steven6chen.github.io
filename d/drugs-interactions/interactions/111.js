The clinical significance of this change is uncertain, but the labeling does not contain special warnings or recommendations related to this interaction.<sup>2</sup><br><br>The likely mechanism of this interaction is ketoconazole inhibition of the CYP3A4 metabolism of lobeglitazone. Ketoconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, and lobeglitazone appears to be metabolized, in part, by CYP3A4 with additional contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which likely explains the relatively low magnitude of this interaction.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
