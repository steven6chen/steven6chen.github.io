Significantly more subjects pretreated with tadalafil (20mg daily for 7 days) experienced reductions in SBP of more than 30mmHg and/or reductions in DBP of more than 20mmHg after administration of nitroglycerin (0.4mg sublingual) than those pretreated with placebo.<sup>4</sup> The largest differences and overall blood pressure effects were seen with standing blood pressure and were at 8 hrs and 24 hrs after nitroglycerin, with no significant differences between tadalafil and placebo observed at 48 hrs and later. A study of sildenafil and nitrates in healthy volunteers found that compared to placebo, sildenafil pretreatment (25mg three times daily for 4 days) was associated with a significantly greater proportion of substantial blood pressure reductions (more than 25mmHg) and more reports of symptomatic hypotension with IV glyceryl trinitrate.<sup>5</sup> With sublingual nitrate administration on day 5, those pretreated with sildenafil experienced a 4-fold greater reduction in SBP than those pretreated with placebo. A separate study by this same group showed that the combination of sildenafil with amlodipine (an antihypertensive that does not act via the cGMP pathway, unlike the nitrates) resulted in solely additive effects on blood pressure.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Both nitrates and PDE 5 inhibitors exert their effects through potentiation of the vasodilatory effects of cGMP -- nitrates by stimulating cGMP production, and PDE 5 inhibitors by inhibiting an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of cGMP. This overlapping effect involving cGMP is believed responsible for the observed synergistic effect on blood pressure.<sup>1,2,3,4,5</sup> Administration guidelines for PDE 5 inhibitors state that nitrate doses should not be given within at least 24 hours of sildenafil or vardenafil, or within at least 48 hours of tadalafil.<sup>1,2,3</sup> Similar precautions appear warranted for amyl nitrite, although specific dosing guidelines are lacking.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Patients who are receiving MAOIs accumulate neurotransmitters in adrenergic neurons.

Not only were these differences of no statistical difference, but any effect of antacids was substantially less than the effect of food, as the relative bioavailability was increased an average of 400% in the fed vs. fasted state.<br><br>These findings are somewhat at odds with those of studies with the gastric acid-lowering agents esomeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) and cimetidine (a histamine-2 receptor antagonist). Mean posaconazole maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and AUC were reduced by 46% and 32%, respectively, when posaconazole (suspension, 400 mg x1) was administered with esomeprazole (40 mg daily x 3 days, starting 2 days prior to posaconazole) in a study of healthy volunteers.<sup>2</sup> Similarly, a case report describes a significant decrease (nearly 50%) in posaconazole minimum plasma concentrations in a patient who had received 3 doses of omeprazole (40 mg daily).<sup>3</sup> Within approximately 2 weeks of omeprazole discontinuation, posaconazole concentrations returned to baseline values. Posaconazole (tablets, 200 mg daily x 10 days) mean Cmax and AUC were each reduced by 39% following coadministration with cimetidine (400 mg BID x 10 days) in another study of healthy volunteers.<sup>4</sup> The precise reason for these discrepant findings are unclear, though the substantially weaker and shorter-duration pH effects of single-dose antacids (vs. PPIs or H2-antagonists) and the use of the tablet (vs. the marketed suspension) formulation are possible explanations.<br><br>Of note, posaconazole prescribing information concludes that coadministration with antacids (or H2-receptor antagonists, except for cimetidine) does not result in significant changes in posaconazole concentrations.<sup>4</sup> <br><br>Any interaction is likely related to the pH-raising effects of antacids.

Based on all available information, it seems prudent to also avoid concurrent use of posaconazole oral suspension with other H2-antagonists whenever possible. Monitor all patients closely for decreased antifungal effects if an H2-antagonist is initiated/dose increased.

However, in response to questions regarding this apparently conflicting recommendation (i.e., prolonged/sustained pH changes may be associated with altered posaconazole bioavailability, but cimetidine somehow is unique among the H2-antagonists for its interaction potential), some authors have argued that the recommendation to avoid concurrent use when possible should be extended to all H2-antagonists.<sup>2</sup> Adding to this uncertainty are a series of studies examining factors associated with posaconazole concentrations and/or clearance in cohorts of patients with multiple serum posaconazole concentration determinations.<sup>3,4,5</sup> In two of these studies, one of which appears to be an extension of the first, concurrent use of ranitidine was not identified as having a significant impact on the apparent oral clearance of posaconazole.<sup>3,4</sup> In contrast, another analysis identified concurrent ranitidine as being significantly associated with lower posaconazole concentrations in a multiple linear regression analysis.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Additionally, data with the delayed-release oral posaconazole tablet show no significant changes in posaconazole concentrations with concurrent use of a single dose of ranitidine (150 mg).<sup>1</sup> Based on this study, the posaconazole prescribing information states that the delayed-release tablet can be used together with H2-antagonists without any dose adjustment. However, whether this single-dose study is adequate support for this recommendation, given the mixed data with immediate-release posaconazole (tablets and oral suspension) is uncertain. Similarly, whether this single-dose ranitidine study with the delayed-release posaconazole tablets helps to clarify the possible interaction between the H2-antagonists and other posaconazole oral dosage forms is unlikely given the unique characteristics of the delayed-release dosage form.<br><br>Any interaction between posaconazole and H2-antagonists is likely due to the impact of the H2-antagonists on gastric pH. Chemically similar to ketoconazole and itraconazole, it is suspected that posaconazole may be similarly sensitive to the pH-increasing effects of the H2-antagonists.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Route of voriconazole administration did not substantially affect increase in C/D ratio.<sup>1</sup> Similarly, a retrospective pharmacokinetic study in 25 patients who were stable on oral tacrolimus and initiated on oral voriconazole 200 mg every 12 h showed a median increase of 139% in their C/D ratio of tacrolimus after 7-10 days of voriconazole.<sup>2</sup> No correlation was found between plasma concentrations of voriconazole and the tacrolimus C/D ratio, and because both drugs were given orally, the authors concluded that variability in tacrolimus concentrations is independent of voriconazole bioavailability.<sup>2</sup> In 2 liver transplant patients randomized to placebo or voriconazole, each with stabilized tacrolimus doses at least 1 week prior, tacrolimus trough concentrations increased 10-fold in 5 days.<sup>3</sup> Repeated administration of oral voriconazole (400 mg twice/day x 1 day, then 200 mg twice/day x 6 days) was associated with increased tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg single dose) Cmax and AUC in healthy subjects by an average of 2-fold and 3-fold, respectively.<sup>4</sup><br><br>The results and conclusions of these studies and case reports support the conclusions of several other published case reports that describe patients who often required more than the labeling-recommended decrease in tacrolimus dose to 1/3 of the original dose following voriconazole initiation.<sup>5,6,7,8,9</sup> Careful plasma tacrolimus concentration monitoring may be warranted in transplant patients who are also receiving voriconazole due to a wide variability in patient response to this drug interaction.<sup>10</sup> The range of C/D ratios of tacrolimus in one study was found to be between -32% and 686% (mean 139%).<sup>2</sup> In another study, the range of C/D ratios was 25-308%.<sup>1</sup> Proposed contributors to this variability are route of administration, number of days after the subjects received their hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, sample size, and presence of poor metabolizers among subjects.<sup>10</sup><br><br>Voriconazole likely inhibits intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 isoenzymes, reducing tacrolimus metabolism and increasing its bioavailability.<sup>4</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Those patients with a copy of the variant *3 allele had greater inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism by ketoconazole.<sup>4</sup><br><br>Ketoconazole inhibits intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4, likely reducing tacrolimus metabolism and increasing its bioavailability.<sup>5</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
