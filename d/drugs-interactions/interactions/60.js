The presumed primary mechanism of interaction between these agents is efavirenz induction of CYP3A4 mediated boceprevir metabolism. Boceprevir inhibition of CYP3A4 mediated efavirenz metabolism is likely responsible for the observed increases in efavirenz concentrations.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Boceprevir may decrease the serum concentration of Ritonavir. <b>Severity</b> Moderate <b>Reliability Rating</b> Fair: Reported in the prescribing information </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Discuss with patients the potential for boceprevir to significantly reduce HIV protease inhibitor concentrations/effectiveness and for the HIV protease inhibitors to reduce boceprevir concentrations/effectiveness when used together with ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors. Monitor antiviral response to both boceprevir and the HIV protease inhibitor closely when such a combination is used. It is unclear if the use of boceprevir with ritonavir alone (i.e., without any other HIV protease inhibitor) results in as significant of an interaction.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> According to data in an FDA safety announcement, concurrent use of boceprevir with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, ritonavir/lopinavir, and ritonavir-boosted darunavir was associated with average reductions in atazanavir, lopinavir, and darunavir minimum serum concentrations (Cmin) of 49%, 43%, and 59%, respectively.<sup>1</sup> Similarly, the average AUC for atazanavir, lopinavir, and darunavir was reduced by 34-44%.<br><br>The average boceprevir was similarly reduced by 45% with concurrent ritonavir/lopinavir and by 32% with ritonavir-boosted darunavir; concurrent ritonavir-boosted atazanavir was not associated with a significant change in boceprevir AUC.<sup>1</sup> In a clinical study summarized in boceprevir prescribing information, coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg daily for 12 days) decreased the maximum concentration and AUC of boceprevir (400 mg 3 times daily for 15 days) by 27% and 19%, respectively.<sup>2</sup> <br><br>The specific mechanism by which boceprevir reduces ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors is unclear. Boceprevir is described as a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 and a potential inhibitor of p-glycoprotein, as well as not being an inducer of most drug-metabolizing enzyme.<sup>2</sup> The mechanism(s) by which ritonavir and/or ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors reduce boceprevir concentrations is uncertain but may be due to induction of the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of boceprevir, which is partly dependent on CYP3A for its metabolism.<sup>2</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
