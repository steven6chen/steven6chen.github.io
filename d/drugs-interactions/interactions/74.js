The atazanavir AUC and minimum serum concentration (Cmin) were an average of 12% and 20% lower, respectively, with concurrent voriconazole in a study of 20 volunteers with functional CYP2C19 who were given atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg daily) with voriconazole (400 mg twice/day x 1 day, then 200 mg twice/day).<sup>1</sup> Among volunteers without functional CYP2C19 (n=8), the average atazanavir AUC and Cmin were 20% and 31% lower with concurrent voriconazole (100 mg twice/day x 1 day, then 50 mg twice/day).<sup>1</sup> In this study the changes in voriconazole AUC according to CYP2C19 status were even more dramatic. Among volunteers with functional CYP2C19, the average voriconazole AUC was 33% lower with concurrent atazanavir/ritonavir, but among those without functional CYP2C19, the average voriconazole AUC was 5.6-fold higher with concurrent atazanavir/ritonavir.<sup>1</sup><br><br>The specific mechanism(s) for this interaction is(are) uncertain. It is suspected that the CYP2C19 dependence is due to a greater reliance on CYP3A in individuals without functional CYP2C19. As such, atazanavir/ritonavir inhibition of CYP3A predominates in the absence of CYP2C19. However, in individuals with functional CYP2C19, ritonavir may predominantly induce voriconazole metabolism (likely via CYP2C19), as has been suggested in studies with ritonavir.<sup>2,3</sup> The mechanism by which voriconazole decreases atazanavir concentrations is unknown.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Ciprofloxacin (Systemic) may increase the serum concentration of CloZAPine. <b>Severity</b> Major <b>Reliability Rating</b> Good </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Reduce clozapine dose to one-third of the original dose and monitor clozapine response closely in patients receiving this combination. Also monitor closely for evidence of QTc prolongation and general clozapine toxicity. Following cessation of ciprofloxacin, the original clozapine dose should be resumed.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> There is conflicting data regarding a potential interaction between ciprofloxacin and clozapine. Published case reports describe patients who experienced increased clozapine concentrations attributed at least partially to ciprofloxacin,<sup>1,2,3,4,5</sup> and one case of a fatality was attributed to this drug interaction.<sup>6</sup> According to these reports, clozapine serum concentrations have increased by as much as 2-fold or more in the presence of ciprofloxacin; however, many reports do not provide information on the clozapine concentration before initiation of ciprofloxacin, and factors such as smoking, caffeine consumption, and/or compliance are often inadequately addressed.<br><br>In contrast to these reports of an interaction, one published case report describes no increase in clozapine concentrations despite treatment with ciprofloxacin.<sup>7</sup> The patient experienced severely elevated clozapine concentrations (9,074 nmol/L), but the serum sample was taken before initiation of ciprofloxacin. Of note, the patient did not report experiencing any adverse effects. The authors of this case report identify the underlying infection, as opposed to the antibiotic treatment, as a potential cause of the elevated clozapine concentrations.<sup>7</sup><br><br>A randomized study in 7 subjects with schizophrenia but without infection reported only moderate elevation (average 29% increase) of clozapine concentrations with concurrent ciprofloxacin.<sup>8</sup> Of note, this study used a relatively lower ciprofloxacin dose of 250 mg twice daily.<br><br>The mechanism is thought to involve the CYP1A2 enzyme: ciprofloxacin is a known CYP1A2 inhibitor, and clozapine is a major CYP1A2 substrate. Current evidence supports a potential CYP1A2-mediated interaction between ciprofloxacin and clozapine, particularly at higher ciprofloxacin doses (ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily), but further study of this interaction in the absence of infection is needed. Despite the questions regarding the magnitude of the interaction between ciprofloxacin and clozapine, due to ciprofloxacin's classification as a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, the clozapine prescribing information recommends reducing the dose of clozapine to one-third of the original dose when adding ciprofloxacin (with a recommended return to the original clozapine dose when ciprofloxacin is removed).<sup>9</sup><br><br>In addition to the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between these agents, their combination may increase the potential for clinically significant QTc prolongation.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

In particular, monitor patients closely for evidence of muscle toxicity (e.g., pain, tenderness, weakness, elevated CPK, etc.) and increased liver function tests.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> An in vitro study in human hepatocytes showed that boceprevir inhibited the uptake of pitavastatin by the OATP1B1 transporter.<sup>1</sup> This same mechanism is suspected in the observed interaction between boceprevir and pravastatin, which like pitavastatin, undergoes little CYP3A-mediated metabolism. The pravastatin AUC and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) were increased by an average of 63% and 49%, respectively, when a single dose of pravastatin (40 mg) was given to healthy subjects receiving boceprevir (800 mg three times/day for 6 days).<sup>2</sup><br><br>According to in vitro studies, boceprevir may inhibit the drug efflux transporter p-glycoprotein and the hepatic uptake transporter SLCO1B1 (aka OATP1B1),<sup>1,3</sup> both of which may be at least partially involved in the distribution and elimination of pitavastatin, potentially serving as a mechanism for this interaction.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

CYP2B6 plays a primary role in methadone metabolism,<sup>2,3</sup> while CYP3A is thought to have little or no involvement.<sup>2,4,5</sup> Aromatase (CYP19) has been shown to play a relatively minor role in the metabolism of methadone,<sup>3,6</sup> and this metabolism can be completely blocked by potent aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole.<sup>6</sup> The role of aromatase in the metabolism of methadone is the likely cause of this interaction; however, the extent to which aromatase/CYP19 metabolizes methadone is still not fully understood. The methadone concentration changes seen in this interaction are statistically significant, but of uncertain clinical significance due to the several routes involved in methadone metabolism.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
