In an open-label crossover study, 17 subjects received cetirizine alone (10mg/day x 4 days), ritonavir alone (300mg twice daily titrated to 600mg twice daily for at least 7 days), and cetirizine plus ritonavir (10mg/day and 600mg twice daily, respectively, x 4 days).<sup>1</sup> Compared to cetirizine alone, when combined with ritonavir cetirizine AUC increased by 42%, clearance decreased by 29%, and elimination half-life increased by 53%.

Longer term clinical consequences of such increased exposure to cetirizine are unclear, but considering the safety profile of cetirizine (particularly in other populations where concentrations/AUC are increased), serious adverse effects would not be expected.<br><br>The mechanism of this apparent interaction is unclear. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP3A4, but cetirizine is only minimally metabolized<sup>2</sup> (and levocetirizine is subject to even less metabolism<sup>3</sup>) making inhibition of metabolism unlikely to fully explain the observed changes. Ritonavir is also an inhibitor of certain drug transporters, such as the efflux transporter p-glycoprotein, and considering that both cetirizine and levocetirizine are p-glycoprotein substrates,<sup>3,4</sup> it is possible that ritonavir inhibition of cetirizine tubular secretion could explain this apparent interaction and that the interaction could extend to levocetirizine as well.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Patients receiving an ARB for treatment of heart failure may be at particularly high risk for complications that may arise from this interaction (fluid accumulation/edema). The interaction is likely of most concern with chronic dosing of NSAIDs; however, effects may be possible following a single NSAID dose.

Two studies in hypertensive patients (n=128 and 216) found that indomethacin significantly diminished the blood pressure-lowering effect of the ARBs losartan and valsartan.<sup>1,2</sup> Both studies also included angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor arms and found more substantial NSAID interactions with the ACE inhibitors, though the differences between the NSAID-ACE inhibitor and -ARB interactions were not statistically significant. Other smaller studies in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals have shown that while NSAIDs don't necessarily increase blood pressure when added to an ARB, the addition of an NSAID can increase weight, increase extracellular fluid volume, decrease sodium excretion/clearance, and decrease renal function (i.e., decrease glomerular filtration rate).<sup>3,4,5</sup><br><br>The exact mechanism for this interaction is not completely understood, but it is suspected that an NSAID-induced decrease in renal vasodilating prostaglandins is at least partly responsible. Such an effect would impact both vascular tone and fluid homeostasis.<br><br>The findings of several case-control and cohort studies suggest that the risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) may also be increased with concurrent use of an NSAID and an ACE inhibitor/ARB, and that the risk may be particularly high with use of the three drug combination of an ACE inhibitor/ARB, diuretic, and NSAID,<sup>6,7,8,9</sup> and higher than that observed with any single drug or two drug combination.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Other risk factors for development of ONJ included concurrent thalidomide (2.4-fold increased risk, p=0.043) and the number of bisphosphonate infusions (4.9-fold increase in risk, p=0.012). In another retrospective analysis of 35 cancer patients who developed ONJ while receiving treatment with zoledronic acid, the drug-related characteristics most associated with ONJ included chemotherapy, corticosteroids, and thalidomide.<sup>2</sup> Other patient factors related with ONJ included advanced age, female sex, anemia, and dental procedures. The mechanism for this possible interaction is unclear. Similarly, the degree to which unidentified patient-related confounders (i.e., systematic differences in those patients receiving thalidomide) or concurrent drug therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, chemotherapy, etc.) are involved in the development of ONJ is not yet known. In three studies, the incidence of ONJ was no higher in patients treated with thalidomide versus control patients, but statistical power in all cases was low due to small sample sizes, low incidence of ONJ, or small numbers of thalidomide exposed/unexposed patients.<sup>4,5,6</sup><br><br>In addition to the possible increase in ONJ risk associated with this combination, a published case series describes three thalidomide treated patients with multiple myeloma and relatively stable renal function who experienced a substantial deterioration in renal function (with concurrent hypocalcemia in 2 of the 3 cases) following a change from pamidronate to zoledronic acid.<sup>2</sup> Renal function improved following the discontinuation of zoledronic acid and thalidomide in all cases, though the specific timing between drug discontinuation and improvement in renal function was not clear in the report. In a subsequent study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, administration of thalidomide (100 mg daily for 14 days) had no impact on zoledronic acid (4 mg single infusion over 15 min) pharmacokinetic variables or creatinine clearance.<sup>8,9</sup> The mechanism for this possible interaction involving renal function and calcium handling is unclear.

Combination treatment with bromocriptine plus octreotide was also more effective (on plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I and growth hormone) than treatment with either agent alone. Adverse effects were not more frequent with the combination, so apart from the greater effectiveness with the combination, the clinical consequences of this apparent interaction are uncertain. The labeling for pasireotide cautions that bromocriptine concentrations may be increased, possibly requiring bromocriptine dose reductions.<sup>4,5</sup><br><br>The mechanism of this possible interaction is not known. Somatostatin analogs exert several effects that could alter bromocriptine bioavailability/absorption, including altering liver and intestinal blood flow, increasing gastric pH, decreasing bile acid and lipase secretion, altering gastric and intestinal transit, and altering growth hormone release.<sup>6,7,8,9,10</sup> Further, bromocriptine has been shown to be a substrate for the drug transporter p-glycoprotein,<sup>11</sup> and studies have shown that octreotide can alter the activity of p-glycoprotein.<sup>12</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Consider using an alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) when possible, particularly in patients with other risk factors for hyperkalemia (eg, renal dysfunction, older age, use of other drugs or supplements that can increase potassium, use of higher-dose TMP-SMZ, etc.).</p>\n<div>\n <p><b>Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers Interacting Members</b> Azilsartan, Candesartan, Eprosartan, Fimasartan, Irbesartan, Losartan, Olmesartan, Telmisartan, Valsartan</p>\n</div> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> A population-based retrospective study in patients age 66 and older who were receiving an antiotensin II antagonist (ARB) or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) found an increased odds of sudden death within 7 days of concurrent use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) [adjusted OR=1.38 (95% CI: 1.09 to 1.76)] versus the comparator antibiotic amoxicillin.<sup>1</sup> Generally similar results were found using a time frame of sudden death within 14 days of TMP-SMZ or amoxicillin (adjusted OR=1.54). Although the authors attempted to adjust for differences among the cases and controls in their analysis, the groups differed on many potentially relevant measured variables (eg, renal disease, duration of ACEI or ARB use, etc.), raising at least some questions about the validity of these findings. Additionally, the study lacked a no-ACEI/no-ARB cohort, and serum potassium data were not collected or reported, both of which make the mechanism of any increase in sudden death unclear (ie, interaction vs. an independent TMP-SMZ effect, hyperkalemia-related, etc.). As an example of the benefit of a possible no-ACEI/no-ARB cohort, a prior study by this same group found that use of TMP-SMZ in beta-blocker users was associated with an increase in the odds for hyperkalemia [OR=5.1(2.8 to 9.4)], but an evaluation of a non-beta-blocker cohort found a similar risk with TMP-SMZ use, suggesting that the hyperkalemia risk was likely reflective of TMP-SMZ use alone and not of any interaction with beta-blockers.<sup>2</sup> An editorial accompanying this study looking at the risk of sudden death addresses some of these and other weaknesses and strengths of the study.<sup>3</sup><br><br>A previous nested case-control study in patients age 66 or older by the same group reported a 6.7-fold increase in the odds of hyperkalemia-associated hospitalization with TMP-SMZ than with concurrent use of amoxicillin.<sup>4</sup> Similarly, two retrospective studies of TMP-SMZ users identified concurrent use of ACEIs as one of several risk factors for TMP-SMZ-associated hyperkalemia,<sup>5,6</sup> and several case reports describe hyperkalemia attributed to the combined use of TMP-SMZ together with an ACEI or ARB.<sup>7,8,9,10,11,12</sup><br><br>Hyperkalemia is an established, though often unrecognized, side effect of trimethoprim.<sup>9,10,13,14</sup> Trimethoprim appears to reduce renal potassium excretion, acting similarly to the structurally similar potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride.<sup>13,14</sup> Patients at high risk of developing trimethoprim-induced hyperkalemia appear to include the higher dose trimethoprim, older age, renal insufficiency, use of prednisone, and concurrent use of drugs that can cause or exacerbate hyperkalemia (such as ACEIs, ARBs, aldosterone antagonists, etc.).<sup>4,5,6,15,16,17</sup><br><br>In contrast to these above reports, a nested case-control study of patients using potassium-altering medications concluded that trimethoprim was not a significant risk factor for hyperkalemia.<sup>18</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

However, acyclovir concentrations when administered as valacyclovir with MMF, were not appreciably different. The only change in mycophenolate pharmacokinetics with either acyclovir or valacyclovir was a 12% decrease in MPAG AUC with the MMF-valacyclovir combination. Another study in 12 healthy volunteers found only a small increase in MPAG AUC, with no significant changes in acyclovir pharmacokinetics or other mycophenolate parameters following administration of acyclovir (800mg), MMF (1g), or the combination.<sup>3</sup> The clinical significance of these observed pharmacokinetic effects is unclear, particularly given the apparent variability in observed effects. One case report of neutropenia associated with valacyclovir administration (in a women with a kidney transplant being treated for a CMV infection) hypothesizes that the neutropenia could have resulted from an interaction between valacyclovir and MMF, though relatively little evidence is provided to support that theory.<sup>4</sup> Prior studies have documented a mechanism-based pharmacodynamic interaction between acyclovir and mycophenolic acid, whereby the antiviral actions of acyclovir (and similar compounds) are enhanced,<sup>5</sup> but it is unclear if this could contribute to any observed or potential toxicity.<br><br>The mechanism of this interaction is not certain, but it is suspected that these agents compete for transporter-mediated elimination, resulting in a relative impairment in elimination.<sup>1</sup> Both acyclovir and mycophenolate have been shown to be substrates for the OAT1 (organic anion transporter 1), OAT3, and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) transporters.<sup>6,7,8,9</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

A subsequent study by the same investigators in 8 renal transplant recipients treated with MMF found that addition of rifampin (600mg daily) for 8 days resulted in an average 17.5% decrease in MPA AUC(0-12h).<sup>3</sup><br><br>It is suspected that rifamycin derivatives alter several metabolism and transport proteins that together account for this observed interaction. Increased glucuronidation of MPA and increased biliary excretion of MPA glucuronides (largely via multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2)) are thought to be primarily responsible for this interaction, though increased glucuronidation of MPA in the distal intestinal tract leading to impaired reabsporption may also be involved and may account for the substantial decrease in later (i.e., 6-12 hr) MPA concentrations.<sup>1,2,3</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Glucuronidases produced by enteric bacteria act on MPAG to liberate active MPA, which is then available for re-absorption as part of the enterohepatic recirculation process that is suspected to contribute to up to 40% of MPA exposure.<sup>1,2</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Case reports describe bleeding and impaired platelet function in patients receiving venlafaxine or duloxetine, though none describe bleeding associated with an SNRI-NSAID combination.<sup>1,2,3,4</sup> An analysis of all the placebo-controlled duloxetine trials did find evidence of a significant increase in bleeding-related adverse events with duloxetine use as well as an increased risk with duloxetine plus NSAID use as compared to with duloxetine alone.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Several case-control studies have reported an association between the combination of SNRIs and NSAIDs and the risk of bleeding, though all have only evaluated the SNRIs in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or tricyclic antidepressants (both of which have been independently associated with altered platelet function and increased bleeding risk).<sup>6,7,8</sup> Of note, the interaction between intermediate serotonin inhibitors (group including venlafaxine) and NSAIDs was significant only for non-selective NSAIDs, and not for the COX-2 inhibitors, in one study.<sup>6</sup> In another, there was evidence of a synergistic interaction on bleeding risk for the SSRI-NSAID interaction, but the interaction between non-selective reuptake inhibitors (including venlafaxine) and NSAIDs was simply additive.<sup>7</sup><br><br>The suspected mechanism for this reported increase in bleeding risk involves both the reduction of gastroprotective prostaglandins by NSAIDs and the antiplatelet effects of both NSAIDs and drugs inhibiting serotonin reuptake.<sup>9</sup> This dual mechanism is important as it seems that existing tissue damage (e.g., NSAID-related gastric erosions) is critical for the appearance of bleeding associated with this interaction.<sup>10</sup> Such absence of a source of tissue damage has been cited as a reason for such a lower absolute risk of cerebrovascular vs. gastrointestinal bleeding with the combination.<sup>9,10</sup> Several potential mechanisms for an antiplatelet effect of the serotonin-altering antidepressants have been reported, but the primary suspected mechanism involves depletion of platelet serotonin concentrations.<sup>11</sup> Serotonin enhances platelet aggregration, and since platelets can not synthesize serotonin, transporter-mediated uptake from blood is required for maintenance of normal intra-platelet serotonin concentrations. Inhibition of this uptake by SNRIs is thought to lead to a gradual depletion of platelet serotonin and consequently, to impaired platelet aggregation.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Unmarked agents are listed because they have properties similar to marked agents, and may respond so within the context of the stated interaction.</p>\n</div> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Addition of duloxetine (30mg daily) to a 44-year-old patient previously stabilized on warfarin was associated with a significant increase in INR. By day 55 of duloxetine, the INR was 5.5, and the patient had associated petechiae and purpura. Warfarin was stopped 3 days later, but duloxetine was continued. On day 85 of duloxetine, the INR peaked at more than 19.0. Duloxetine was stopped 9 days later, and within 4 days the INR fell to 1.2. Warfarin therapy was resumed nearly 2 weeks later at the pre-duloxetine dose with therapeutic INRs as observed prior to duloxetine therapy.<sup>1</sup> Conversely, a single duloxetine (60mg) dose was associated with a substantial decrease in INR (to 1.5 from approximately 2.6) in a patient treated with acenocoumarol for 8 years.<sup>2</sup> This decrease in INR persisted for 3 weeks following the single duloxetine dose. The persistence of this effect calls into question the role of duloxetine in the interaction as its moderate half-life (approximately 12 hrs) would suggest that any direct effect of duloxetine would decline within at least 1-3 days. That this effect was observed following only a single dose also raises questions regarding the role of duloxetine.<br><br>The mechanism(s) for these effects is unclear. Duloxetine is not considered a significant inhibitor or inducer of any drug metabolizing enzymes. Both duloxetine and R-warfarin (less potent isomer of warfarin) are substrates for CYP1A2, so it is possible that competition for this enzyme results in some impairment in R-warfarin metabolism, but this would not be expected to cause the magnitude of effect observed in the case reports. Both warfarin and duloxetine are also highly-bound to plasma protein, so protein binding diplacement may also be a contributing factor.<br><br>In addition to these specific studies, data suggesting that duloxetine and other serotonin reuptake inhibitors may impair platelet function and/or cause bleeding, duloxetine prescribing information cautions that concurrent use with warfarin may be associated with a greater risk for bleeding.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Several case-control studies have reported an association between the combination of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and NSAIDs and the risk of bleeding, though most have only evaluated the SNRIs in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or tricyclic antidepressants (both of which have been independently associated with altered platelet function and increased bleeding risk).<sup>4,5,6,7,8</sup> Of note, the interaction between intermediate serotonin inhibitors (group including the SNRI venlafaxine) and NSAIDs was significant only for non-selective NSAIDs, and not for the COX-2 inhibitors, in one study.<sup>6</sup> In another, there was evidence of a synergistic interaction on bleeding risk for the SSRI-NSAID interaction, but the interaction between non-selective reuptake inhibitors (including venlafaxine) and NSAIDs was simply additive.<sup>7</sup> In contrast, two more recent case-control studies reported that the association between venlafaxine use and GI bleeding was even greater than that reported with the SSRIs.<sup>4,5</sup><br><br>Case reports describe bleeding and impaired platelet function in patients receiving venlafaxine or duloxetine, though none describe bleeding associated with an SNRI-warfarin combination.<sup>9,10,11,12</sup><br><br>The suspected mechanism for much of this reported increase in bleeding risk involves both the reduction of gastroprotective prostaglandins by NSAIDs and the antiplatelet effects of both NSAIDs and drugs inhibiting serotonin reuptake.<sup>13</sup> This dual mechanism is important as it seems that existing tissue damage (e.g., NSAID-related gastric erosions) is critical for the appearance of bleeding associated with this interaction.<sup>14</sup> Such absence of a source of tissue damage has been cited as a reason for such a lower absolute risk of cerebrovascular vs. gastrointestinal bleeding with the combination.<sup>13,14</sup> This point raises certain questions about the degree of risk associated with concurrent use of an SNRI and warfarin (due to lack of NSAID- or aspirin-related tissue damage). Several potential mechanisms for an antiplatelet effect of the serotonin-altering antidepressants have been reported, but the primary suspected mechanism involves depletion of platelet serotonin concentrations.<sup>15</sup> Serotonin enhances platelet aggregration, and since platelets can not synthesize serotonin, transporter-mediated uptake from blood is required for maintenance of normal intra-platelet serotonin concentrations.
