When morphine was administered with clopidogrel, the time to reach maximal platelet inhibition was delayed by 1.75 hours, platelet plug formation inhibition under high shear stress was delayed by 30 minutes, and there was greater ADP-induced platelet aggregation 1 to 4 hours after administration.<sup>1</sup> Similarly, in patients presenting with ACS treated with ticagrelor, morphine administration resulted in a greater proportion of patients with high platelet reactivity (at all measured time points) compared with patients who received placebo.<sup>4</sup> In an pooled analysis of 5 studies in which patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were treated with either prasugrel or ticagrelor, morphine use was an independent predictor of high residual platelet reactivity (OR 1.89, 95% CI [1.40 to 2.56]) even after statistical adjustment.<sup>5</sup> Additionally, post hoc analyses of studies aimed to assess the platelet reactivity in patients with STEMI treated with prasugrel or ticagrelor reported that morphine use was an independent predictor of diminished antiplatelet effects.<sup>6,7</sup> <br><br>In contrast, studies of prasugrel and ticagrelor in healthy volunteers reported that despite reductions in prasugrel or ticagrelor concentrations, morphine administration had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (eg, ADP-induced whole blood aggregation, inhibition of platelet plug formation under high shear rates, platelet reactivity index) of these drugs.<sup>2,3</sup> In a study of STEMI patients treated with escalating loading doses of ticagrelor, morphine use was not found to be an independent predictor of high residual platelet reactivity.<sup>8</sup><br><br>Although the clinical outcomes of this potential interaction have not been specifically investigated, one database analysis did report an association between morphine use and elevated mortality and major cardiovascular events in patients with non ST elevation acute coronary syndromes, but the potential correlation with concomitant use of P2Y12 inhibitors was not controlled for or explored.<sup>9</sup><br><br>The mechanism of this interaction has not been fully investigated, but due to prolongation of the Tmax and the time to reach maximal platelet inhibition, delays in gastric emptying, due to the opiate effects of morphine, may play a significant role in this interaction.

With atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg daily) or lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg twice daily) the grazoprevir AUC was 10.6- to 12.9-fold higher. In contrast, concurrent ritonavir alone (100 mg twice daily) with a single dose of grazoprevir was associated with a smaller 2-fold increase in grazoprevir AUC. Cyclosporine (400 mg single dose) had the largest impact on grazoprevir concentrations, as the grazoprevir AUC was 15.2-fold higher. Similarly, concurrent cyclosporine was associated with a 17-fold increase in the grazoprevir maximum serum concentration and a 3.4-fold increase in the grazoprevir minimum serum concentration.<br><br>These drugs appear to increase grazoprevir concentrations primarily via inhibition of SLCO1B1, which is at least partially responsible for hepatic uptake of grazoprevir. <sup>1</sup> By inhibiting this process, less grazoprevir is available for metabolism and elimination. It is also important to note that many SLCO1B1 inhibitors are also capable of at least some CYP3A4 inhibition, which may also contribute to the large magnitude of these interactions as grazoprevir is also a substrate for CYP3A4.<sup>1</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

If combined, monitor for increased carbamazepine effects/toxicities and for reduced clarithromycin efficacy.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> In one study, 7 hospitalized psychiatric patients taking carbamazepine (200 mg three times daily) were treated with clarithromycin (200 mg twice daily) for 5 days.<sup>1</sup> Carbamazepine levels were 111% higher on the day of clarithromycin discontinuation compared with levels taken 1 week after clarithromycin discontinuation. Four patients developed symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity (eg, drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia).<sup>1</sup> In another analysis of 5 patients, despite a preemptive carbamazepine dose decrease (30% to 40%), the addition of clarithromycin increased carbamazepine concentrations by 26% and 3 patients experienced carbamazepine toxicity.<sup>2</sup> Two case reports also describe increases in carbamazepine concentrations with the addition of clarithromycin,<sup>3,4</sup> and one report describes a patient who developed hyponatremia with neurologic symptoms (eg, lethargy, dizziness) with the combination.<sup>5</sup> <br><br>In addition to increases in carbamazepine concentrations, this combination may lead to alterations in clarithromycin concentrations. Clarithromycin concentrations have not been evaluated in the presence of the strong CYP3A4 inducer carbamazepine. However, in a study of 34 HIV-positive volunteers, the average clarithromycin AUC was 44% lower while the average 14-hydroxyclarithromycin AUC was 57% higher when clarithromycin (500 mg every 12 hours) was combined with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifabutin (300 mg/day).<sup>6</sup> Consistent with these data, the clarithromycin prescribing information states that the decrease in clarithromycin concentrations and increase in 14-hydroxyclarithromycin concentrations may alter the antimicrobial effectiveness of clarithromycin when used with CYP3A4 inducers.<sup>7</sup><br><br>The mechanism by which clarithromycin increases carbamazepine concentrations is likely due to the ability of clarithromycin to inhibit CYP3A4, the enzyme responsible for carbamazepine metabolism.
