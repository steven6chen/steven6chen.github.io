Monitor patients closely for evidence of both exaggerated metoprolol effects and/or metoprolol toxicity, as well as for evidence of a diminished antihypertensive effect.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> The metoprolol AUC and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) were an average of 229% and 90% higher, respectively, in 12 healthy subjects receiving mirabegron (160 mg/day) for 5 days prior to a single dose of metoprolol (100 mg).<sup>1</sup> The likely mechanism for this apparent interaction is mirabegron inhibition of the CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of metoprolol; mirabegron is classified as a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor in the mirabegron prescribing information.<sup>1</sup><br><br>This pharmacokinetic interaction contrasts with a potential pharmacodynamic interaction where mirabegron may antagonize the clinical blood pressure-lowering effects of metoprolol and other similar antihypertensives. The mirabegron prescribing information reports dose-dependent increases in blood pressure with use.<sup>1</sup> In healthy volunteers mirabegron (at doses of up to 50 mg) produced mean maximum increases in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 3.5/1.5 mmHg vs. placebo. However, in overactive bladder (OAB) patients, including those with pre-existing hypertension, receiving a maximum dose of mirabegron 50 mg the systolic/diastolic blood pressure was only 0.5-1 mmHg greater than placebo. OAB patients infrequently reported worsening of pre-existing hypertension with mirabegron. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure increases were reversible with the discontinuation of mirabegron. Based on these findings, the mirabegron prescribing information recommends periodic monitoring of blood pressure throughout therapy, particularly in patients with pre-existing hypertension.<sup>1</sup> Caution should also be taken to monitor patients for drug interactions with mirabegron, especially with CYP2D6 substrates, which may alter blood pressure control. Adjustments to mirabegron dosing in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment should be taken to avoid potential increases in blood pressure. The specific mechanism for mirabegron increasing blood pressure is uncertain, but mirabegron has been shown to produce beta-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation at a dose of 200 mg, a 4-fold increase above the maximum recommended daily dose.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

One subject had been previously stable on warfarin therapy. In both reported cases, the INR normalized within 1 week of discontinuing use of the herbal product.<sup>1</sup> Another case report describes serious intraoperative hemorrhage in a 53-year-old male who had been taking saw palmetto preoperatively. The patient had not received thromboprophylaxis, and preoperative coagulation studies were normal. The author does not indicate whether the herbal product used preoperatively contained only saw palmetto.<sup>2</sup> A review article evaluating the safety of saw palmetto (as a monopreparation) reported minimal adverse effects and no evidence of drug interactions.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Based on animal data, some authors suggest that saw palmetto may interfere with platelet function via cyclooxygenase inhibition.<sup>2</sup> Results from some in vivo studies, however, suggest that saw palmetto does not affect platelet function.<sup>4</sup> Saw palmetto extract has been reported to inhibit CYP isoenzymes 2C9, 3A4, and 2D6 in vitro;<sup>5</sup> however, in 12 healthy subjects saw palmetto had no effect on the metabolism of alprazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) or dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate).<sup>6</sup> S-warfarin (more potent enantiomer) is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 and R-warfarin is primarily metabolized via CYP3A4. Given the scarcity of adverse events reported, as well as conflicting pharmacodynamic/kinetic observations made, it is unclear whether concomitant use of saw palmetto and warfarin increases the risk for bleeding. Authors who describe an elevated INR with concomitant use of warfarin and an herbal product containing saw palmetto, vitamin E, and pumpkin seed extract attribute the interaction to vitamin E.<sup>1</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Though specific data with lower cholestyramine doses are not available, it is expected that lipid-lowering doses may also have a significant impact on teriflunomide concentrations. The teriflunomide concentration decreased from 36.3 mcg/mL to 1.3 mcg/mL after colesevelam therapy in a study of 18 healthy volunteers who received maximum dose colesevelam (4.375 gm/day) to accelerate medically necessary elimination of teriflunomide.<sup>2</sup> All subjects received teriflunomide 70 mg/day for 5 days followed by colesevelam therapy for 11 days starting the day after teriflunomide was stopped (ie, day 6).<br><br>According to data described in the prescribing information for leflunomide, which is metabolized to teriflunomide, cholestyramine administration (8 g three times/day for 24 hrs) was associated with a 40% reduction in the concentration of teriflunomide at 24 hours, and a 49% to 65% reduction in teriflunomide concentrations at 48 hours.<sup>3</sup> Similar outcomes were reportedly observed in both larger groups of volunteers (n=96) and patients (n=13).<sup>3</sup><br><br>The specific mechanism for this interaction is not certain but appears to be bile acid sequestrant binding to teriflunomide (and/or metabolites) excreted in the bile, preventing its reabsorption. Pharmacokinetic data show that teriflunomide is extensively excreted in the bile and that biliary recycling may account for the very long half-life of leflunomide.<sup>1,3</sup> Further, in one study, concurrent cholestyramine was associated with an average 23% increase in recovered teriflunomide over a 21-day period, with most of the excess teriflunomide recovered in the feces.<sup>1</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
