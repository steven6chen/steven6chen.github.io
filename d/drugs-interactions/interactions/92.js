They are included as hyperglycemic-associated agents because they have been reported to cause clinically significant hyperglycemia at a frequency of at least 10%, or include label warnings that suggest an increased risk for hyperglycemia warranting additional monitoring or concomitant medication dose adjustment, or because published literature suggests a significant risk of hyperglycemia with their use. Although numerous factors affect a patient's risk for hyperglycemia (eg, severity and type of diabetes, comorbid disease states), use of these agents may reduce the efficacy of antidiabetic agents, resulting in hyperglycemia or loss of diabetic control, and necessitate dose escalation of the antidiabetic agent.<sup>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1. <i>Novolog</i> (insulin aspart) [prescribing information].

Specifically, the risk for bleeding may be increased. FluvoxaMINE may decrease serum concentrations of the active metabolite(s) of Clopidogrel. <b>Severity</b> Moderate <b>Reliability Rating</b> Fair </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Carefully consider the potential benefits of this combination against the possible risks for decreased clopidogrel antiplatelet activity or increased bleeding due to additional antiplatelet actions of fluvoxamine. Monitor clinical response to combination therapy closely.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Fluvoxamine reduced the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel as measured by both ADP-induced platelet aggregation (32.3% with fluvoxamine vs. 23.5% with clopidogrel alone) and platelet reactivity index (PRI) (52.7% with fluvoxamine vs. 47.7% with clopidogrel alone), while the use of citalopram, another selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), did not significantly alter the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel in a cross-over trial of 15 healthy volunteers who received fluvoxamine (100 mg daily for 7 days) or citalopram (20 mg daily for 7 days) together with clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose given on day 5, 75 mg daily for 2 days given on days 6 and 7 of antidepressant therapy).<sup>1</sup> Only 2/15 subjects attained more than a 50% decrease in PRI with fluvoxamine compared to 10/15 subjects with citalopram.<br><br>In contrast, a retrospective cohort study of patients who were post-myocardial infarction and receiving treatment with either aspirin alone or aspirin plus clopidogrel (n=27,058) found an increased bleeding risk among those who were also using a SSRI (HR=1.42 to 1.57).<sup>2</sup> Specifically, addition of an SSRI to either clopidogrel alone or clopidogrel and aspirin was associated with a 1.54- or 1.57-fold increase in risk, respectively, though the numbers in these subgroups were relatively small (clopidogrel and SSRI, n=45; clopidogrel, aspirin, and SSRI, n=239). Concurrent use of an SSRI was identified as a significant risk factor for lower gastrointestinal bleeding among clopidogrel users in a population-based study of 3,238 clopidogrel users and 12,952 matched controls.<sup>3</sup><br><br>The likely mechanism by which fluvoxamine would interfere with clopidogrel effectiveness is inhibition of metabolic activation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite, a process that is largely dependent on CYP2C19. Fluvoxamine is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19 and inhibits, to at least some degree, several other enzymes that may be partially involved in clopidogrel activation. The mechanism by which fluvoxamine would increase the risk for bleeding with concurrent clopidogrel is likely additive platelet inhibition resulting from the antiplatelet effects of fluvoxamine-mediated inhibition of platelet serotonin uptake. Whether this combination will result in an increased risk for thrombosis due to impaired clopidogrel effectiveness or an increased risk for bleeding due to additive antiplatelet effects of fluvoxamine is uncertain. Careful consideration should be given to the risks and benefits of the combination, and patients using this combination should be monitored closely.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

In an unmatched case-control study of patients with malaria treated with artemether/lumefantrine, lumefantrine concentrations were significantly higher in 67 HIV patients treated with nevirapine compared with 99 HIV-negative patients, but 33% of nevirapine treated patients had persistent parasitemia compared with less than 25% of HIV negative patients.<sup>4</sup> In a pooled analysis of two clinical trials of HIV-positive children treated with artemether/lumefantrine, there was a higher risk of recurrent parasitemia in children treated with nevirapine compared with children taking lopinavir/ritonavir (15.3% vs 35.5%; <i>P</i> = .009).<sup>5</sup> In contrast, no difference in clinical and parasitological response was seen with artemether/lumefantrine treatment in 128 HIV-positive patients taking nevirapine compared with 75 HIV-positive patients taking no antiretroviral therapy.<sup>6</sup><br><br>The mechanism of this interaction has not been fully investigated, but nevirapine induction,<sup>7</sup> and possibly inhibition,<sup>8</sup> of CYP3A4, an enzyme responsible for artemether and lumefantrine metabolism, is likely involved.<sup>9</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Additionally, there may be some increased risk of serotonin syndrome with combined therapy with serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) based on one case report.<sup>2</sup> The case involved a 32-year-old patient who had been taking venlafaxine for several years and developed signs and symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome within hours of taking a single metoclopramide dose. The symptoms gradually resolved over several hours but then recurred following ingestion of a second metoclopramide dose.<br><br>Dopaminergic activity within the nigrostriatal pathway (at dopamine D1 receptors) and striatopallidal pathway (at dopamine D2 receptors) regulates output from the basal ganglia which controls movement.<sup>3</sup> Metoclopramide inhibits central D2 receptors, which may cause an imbalance in dopaminergic activity between the nigrostriatal and striatopallidal pathways leading to movement-related side effects.<sup>4</sup> Other medications that inhibit central dopaminergic activity either directly (e.g. antipsychotics) or indirectly (e.g. serotonergic antidepressants) may increase the likelihood of serious movement-related side effects in patients receiving metoclopramide. The pathophysiology of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is poorly understood, but the syndrome is associated with many of the same drugs (e.g. antipsychotics, serotonergic antidepressants) as extrapyramidal side effects and similar precautions regarding the use of multiple associated agents should be taken.<sup>1,5</sup> An increase in serotonin syndrome with the combination of SNRIs and metoclopramide may be the result of dopaminergic and/or serotonergic actions of metoclopramide in combination with serotonergic effects of SSRIs.<sup>2</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Specifically, bosentan may increase concentrations of 14-hydroxyclarithromycin. Bosentan may decrease the serum concentration of Clarithromycin. Clarithromycin may increase the serum concentration of Bosentan. <b>Severity</b> Major <b>Reliability Rating</b> Good </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Consider alternative antimicrobial therapy when possible. Due to the different antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin and its active 14-hydroxy metabolite, drugs such as bosentan, that may enhance the metabolism of clarithromycin into 14-hydroxyclarithromycin may alter the clinical activity of clarithromycin, possibly impairing the intended therapeutic effectiveness of clarithromycin. Additionally, increased bosentan toxicity may be expected with this combination, so monitor closely for increased toxicity of bosentan with concurrent use of clarithromycin.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> The bosentan AUC and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) were an average of 3.7- and 3.8-fold higher, respectively, with concurrent use clarithromycin in a study of 16 healthy volunteers who received bosentan 125 mg twice daily for 14 days together with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for the last 4 days of bosentan.<sup>1</sup> The AUC of the active hydroxy-bosentan metabolite was also an average of 3.05-fold higher with concurrent clarithromycin. Of note, this study also failed to note any significant impact of genetically-determined deficient CYP2C9 and/or OATP1B1 activity on the magnitude of this interaction, though it is likely that the study was inadequately powered to detect anything other than a large genetic influence. These findings are generally consistent with the bosentan prescribing information, which reports a 2.3- and 2.1-fold increase in bosentan AUC and Cmax with ketoconazole, which, like clarithromycin, is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4.<sup>2</sup> Unlike ketoconazole, however, clarithromycin is also an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, which are also determinants of bosentan disposition. This distinction may at least partially explain the greater magnitude interaction with clarithromycin.<br><br>An additional aspect to consider with this combination is the potential for bosentan to alter clarithromycin metabolism and disposition. Although data regarding this specific aspect of the interaction was not examined in the published study of the combination,<sup>1</sup> data concerning the use of clarithromycin with other CYP3A4 inducers are available. The average clarithromycin AUC was 44% lower while the average 14-hydroxyclarithromycin AUC was 57% higher with concurrent use of clarithromycin (500 mg every 12 hours) and the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifabutin (300 mg/day) in a study of 34 HIV-positive volunteers.<sup>3</sup> In another pharmacokinetic study conducted in 16 healthy volunteers, coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inducer etravirine (200 mg twice daily) and clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 39% decrease in clarithromycin AUC and a 21% increase in 14-hydroxyclarithromycin AUC.<sup>4</sup> Consistent with these data, the clarithromycin prescribing information cautions that the decrease in clarithromycin concentrations and increase in 14-hydroxyclarithromycin concentrations may alter the antimicrobial effectiveness of clarithromycin when used in such combinations.<sup>5</sup> Particular caution is advised when treating <i>Mycobacterium avium</i>, as 14-hydroxyclarithromycin has reduced activity against this pathogen. As a result, alternative antimicrobial therapy is recommended when possible.<sup>5</sup> The likely mechanism for this interaction is induction of the CYP3A enzyme that mediates the 14-hydroxylation of clarithromycin.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

In those patients who did not experience a significant change in INR, the average INR was 2.03 at baseline and 1.97 approximately six days after the first dose of oseltamivir. Bleeding events (all relatively minor) were experienced by three of the seven INR-increased patients in the retrospective review. A published case report and several postmarketing reports to regulatory agencies also describe INR increases in patients who received oseltamivir during warfarin treatment.<sup>2,3</sup> Some reports also describe INR decreases.<sup>2</sup><br><br>Conversely, a study in 20 warfarin-treated volunteers found no significant increase in INR with concurrent oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily for 4.5 days) and warfarin (with INR stable between 2.0-3.5 in the 2 weeks prior to oseltamivir).<sup>4</sup> In a retrospective cohort analysis of 13,406 elderly patients receiving warfarin for at least one month prior to initiation of oseltamivir, the odds of a diagnosis billing code associated with a bleeding event did not significantly increase in the 14 days following oseltamivir prescription compared with the 14 days following lisinopril prescription.<sup>5</sup> A sensitivity analysis found a possible increase in bleeding odds within 7 days of oseltamivir initiation (odds ratio 1.47).<br><br>No published data support a likely mechanism of interaction between these agents. Given the sensitivity of warfarin effects to many factors (e.g., diet, smoking, disease states, coadministration of other drugs, function of multiple enzymes), it is unclear whether the association of oseltamivir initiation with INR changes in some cases may be due to a drug interaction or if oseltamivir use reflects the presence of a more severe viral infection and that this is therefore more of a warfarin-infection interaction.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
