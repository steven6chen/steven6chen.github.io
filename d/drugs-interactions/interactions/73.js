Concentrations of other metabolites, including those of the cytotoxic metabolite 5-fluorouracil, were not significantly altered with antacid use. Though the clinical impact of this apparent interaction is not clear, the lack of a significant impact on 5-fluorouracil concentrations and the relatively low magnitude changes for capecitabine and 5'-DFCR suggest the interaction is likely to be of only limited clinical significance.<br><br>The specific mechanism for this interaction is uncertain. A prior in vitro study performed on Maalox in combination with capecitabine showed a delayed dissolution and disintegration of capecitabine,<sup>1,3</sup> and two retrospective analyses have reported evidence that the acid-reducing proton pump inhibitors may impair the effectiveness of capecitabine.<sup>4,5</sup> However, an in vivo study revealed that coadministration of Maalox with capecitabine causes an increase in the plasma concentration of capecitabine. This may be due to the pH differences seen when Maalox coadministartion occurs as capecitabine is not stable in acidic solutions.<sup>6</sup> An increase in pH mediated by administration of Maalox may help increase the absorption of capecitabine by increasing its stability in the stomach. The reason for any possible differences between proton pump inhibitors and antacids is unclear.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1. Reigner B, Clive S, Cassidy J, et al.

She had been taking that oral contraceptive for 14 months, and prior to that had taken the same formulation but with a slightly higher dose of ethinyl estradiol (35 mcg) for 2 years with no problem. The mechanism for this interaction was hypothesized to be decreased prostacyclin production due to COX-2 inhibition by the valdecoxib, which resulted in relatively enhanced thrombogenic activity of the estrogen, particularly in the presence of a predisposing factor.<sup>1</sup><br><br>An analysis based on Medicaid claims data from 184,169 female rofecoxib users (309,504 person-years of exposure) concluded that rofecoxib increased the myocardial infarction hazard ratio in both estrogen-exposed and -unexposed women, but that the interaction between rofecoxib and estrogen use was non-significant.<sup>2</sup><br><br>The degree to which estrogens and COX-2 inhibitors interact is uncertain, as is(are) the precise mechanism(s) by which they interact. In addition to the potential additive/synergistic effects on thrombosis, several studies suggest a possible pharmacokinetic interaction as well. The ethinyl estradiol AUC was increased by an average of 37% and 50-60% with etoricoxib 60 mg/day and 120 mg/day, respectively.<sup>3,4,5</sup> Similarly, concentrations of estrone, equiline, and 17-beta-estradiol were also 22-76% higher with concurrent etoricoxib.<sup>4,5</sup> These effects may be related to etoricoxib inhibition of sulfotransferase 1E1 (SULT1E1) and/or inhibition of other sulfotransferases involved in the metabolism of estrogens.<sup>4,5</sup> Of note, celecoxib has also been shown in animal and in in vitro studies to alter the sulfation of estrogens, most notably by shifting metabolism from one specific metabolite towards the production of another (attributed primarily to changes in SULT2A1 activity).<sup>6,7,8</sup> In addition, the average ethinyl estradiol AUC was 13% higher with concurrent rofecoxib (175 mg/day x 14 days),<sup>9</sup> though whether this also reflects altered sulfonation is unclear. In contrast to these studies, a study with the COX-2 inhibitor lumiracoxib (400 mg/day) concluded that there was no significant interaction with ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel.<sup>10</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
