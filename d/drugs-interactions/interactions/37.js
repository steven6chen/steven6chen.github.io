Cephalosporins lacking this sidechain do not appear to be associated with this interaction. A mechanism for this interaction is unclear. It seems possible that the drugs inhibit acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, thus inhibiting the metabolism of acetaldehyde (the primary metabolite of alcohol). However, a study in normal subjects demonstrated no effects of cefotetan on the pharmacokinetics of either alcohol or acetaldehyde.<sup>7</sup> Ceftriaxone contains an MTT sidechain in its chemical structure.

Significantly more subjects pretreated with tadalafil (20 mg daily for 7 days) experienced reductions in SBP of more than 30 mmHg and/or reductions in DBP of more than 20 mmHg after administration of nitroglycerin (0.4 mg sublingual) than those pretreated with placebo.<sup>5</sup> The largest differences and overall blood pressure effects were seen with standing blood pressure and were at 8 and 24 hours after nitroglycerin, with no significant differences between tadalafil and placebo observed at 48 hours and later. A study of sildenafil and nitrates in healthy volunteers found that compared to placebo, sildenafil pretreatment (25 mg 3 times daily for 4 days) was associated with a significantly greater proportion of substantial blood pressure reductions (more than 25 mmHg) and more reports of symptomatic hypotension with IV glyceryl trinitrate.<sup>6</sup> With sublingual nitrate administration on day 5, those pretreated with sildenafil experienced a 4-fold greater reduction in SBP than those pretreated with placebo. A separate study by this same group showed that the combination of sildenafil with amlodipine (an antihypertensive that does not act via the cGMP pathway, unlike the nitrates) resulted in solely additive effects on blood pressure.<sup>6</sup><br><br>Both nitrates and PDE 5 inhibitors exert their effects through potentiation of the vasodilatory effects of cGMP -- nitrates by stimulating cGMP production, and PDE 5 inhibitors by inhibiting an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of cGMP. This overlapping effect involving cGMP is believed responsible for the observed synergistic effect on blood pressure.<sup>1,2,3,4,5,6</sup> While no safe interval between use of a PDE5 inhibitor and a nitrate has been established, 2013 guidelines for management of ST-segment elevation MI and unstable angina/non ST-segment elevation MI published by the American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association support the administration of nitrates when medically necessary at least 24 hours after sildenafil or vardenafil or 48 hours after tadalafil.<sup>7,8</sup> Avanafil US prescribing information states that in a life-threatening situation where a nitrate is desired in a patient who has taken avanafil, a nitrate may be administered at least 12 hours after the last avanafil dose was ingested, but only with close medical supervision and monitoring.<sup>4</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1. <i>Levitra</i> (vardenafil) [prescribing information].

Only one study directly assessed the pharmacokinetics/dynamics of warfarin with the addition of clopidogrel.<sup>1</sup> In this investigation, serum warfarin concentrations were unchanged in warfarin-stable patients (n=43) during and following an 8-day course of clopidogrel (75 mg/day). Patient INRs were likewise unchanged. No increase in side effects (including bleeding) was noted.<br><br>Nevertheless, a number of other studies have shown an increased bleeding risk with various combinations of AP and AC agents. <br><br>Two separate, population-based observational studies evaluated bleeding rates in elderly post-MI patients, and patients treated for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeds. In the first, 21443 elderly acute MI survivors were evaluated for hospitalizations due to bleeding complications given therapy with various AC and AP mono- and combination therapies.<sup>2</sup> There was an increased risk of bleeding (primarily GI) associated with combination therapy, with aspirin plus a thienopyridine (eg, clopidogrel) or aspirin plus warfarin conferring an approximately 2-fold higher risk than individual agents alone. Triple combination therapy (dual antiplatelets + anticoagulant) resulted in a nearly 3-fold increase. In the second case-controlled study, 1443 patients with serious UGI bleeds were evaluated for exposure to various antihrombotic regimens.<sup>3</sup> Treatment with various two-drug combinations of aspirin, dipyridamole, vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or clopidogrel were associated with 2- to 7-fold higher risk as compared to use of any drug alone. AP therapy with aspirin in combination with VKA was associated with a 5.3-fold increase.<sup>3</sup><br><br>In one retrospective review, 800 acute coronary patients undergoing stent placement were discharged on either warfarin with dual AP therapy (aspirin + thienopyridine) compared with warfarin and single AP agents.<sup>4</sup> Major bleeding events were observed in 5-6% of patients, with no difference between the treatment groups. The rate of bleeding events equates to an approximate patient-years exposure rate of 0.09-0.12. This is markedly higher than the incidence rates of bleeding observed with monotherapy aspirin (0.032) or warfarin (0.059) as reported for elderly post-MI patients in the Buresly study,<sup>2</sup> although acknowledging the latter study did not involve coronary intervention procedures. <br><br>Additionally, several randomized trials in post-MI or ACS patients have documented increased risk of major bleeds with low-dose aspirin in combination with oral anticoagulants as compared to aspirin alone.<sup>5,6,7</sup><br><br>Thus, despite the limited direct evidence for lack of an effect of clopidogrel on warfarin pharmacokinetics reported by Lidell et al., there has been a fairly consistently observation of increased risk with combination antithrombotic therapy. Given the differing mechanisms of antithrombosis between agents like warfarin and the antiplatelet agents, it seems very reasonable to suspect enhanced anticoagulation effects in the face of therapy with multiple agents. These data suggest that clinicians should carefully weigh the merits of combination therapy considering the possibility of increased bleeding risk.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Caspofungin AUC was increased an average of 12% when coadministered with rifampin (600 mg daily for 14 days), though initially, the caspofungin AUC was increased by up to 61% and the caspofungin minimum concentration (Cmin) was increased by up to 170%.<sup>1</sup> Conversely, caspofungin Cmin was 14% to 31% lower following 14 days of concurrent rifampin in subjects who had been receiving rifampin for an additional 14 days prior to caspofungin.<sup>1</sup> Based on these data, caspofungin prescribing information recommends increasing the caspofungin dose to 70 mg daily when used with rifampin.<sup>2</sup><br><br>The mechanism of this apparent interaction is unclear, but considering that caspofungin removal from the plasma appears to be largely due to tissue distribution, with only slow metabolism (primarily non-cytochrome P450), it does not appear that induced metabolism is responsible.<sup>2,3,4</sup> Rather, a proposed mechanism for this interaction is short-term inhibition and long-term induction of OATP1B1-mediated hepatic caspofungin uptake by rifampin.<sup>3</sup> In support of this mechanism is that rifampin is a OATP1B1 substrate, accounting for the short-term inhibition, which is present until rifampin-mediated induction of OATP1B1 uptake predominates, and that caspofungin elimination from the plasma appears to be largely distribution- (vs. metabolism-) dependent.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Conversely, efavirenz AUC and peak concentrations averaged 43% and 37% higher, respectively, during combination therapy. A case report also describes a breakthrough Candida infection in a 50-year-old man receiving both an anti-HIV medication regimen that included efavirenz and voriconazole.<sup>4</sup> According to the report, the patient's infection resolved following an increase in the voriconazole dose from 200mg twice daily to 350mg twice daily.<br><br>Efavirenz is a cytochrome P450 inducer, and subsequent enhancement of voriconazole metabolism may account in part for this observed interaction. Similarly, voriconazole inhibition of efavirenz metabolism via CYP3A4 may be responsible for the increased efavirenz AUC and maximum plasma concentrations seen with the combination. Nevirapine would also be expected to decrease the serum concentration of voriconazole, but delavirdine (CYP3A4 inhibitor) and etravirine (CYP2C9 and 2C19 inhibitor), would likely increase voriconazole concentrations, the clinical significance of which are unclear.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
