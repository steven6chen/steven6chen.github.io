Following the primary vaccine administration, acetaminophen-treated patients had significantly lower antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for all 10 pneumococcal serotypes, protein D, anti-diphtheria, anti-tetanus, and anti-pertactin. After boosting, significantly lower antibody GMCs persisted for anti-tetanus, protein D, and most (9/10) of the pneumococcal serotypes.<sup>1</sup><br><br>In contrast, two other studies in children reported that antibody response to diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or DTP-inactivated poliovirus vaccines was not significantly different among children receiving acetaminophen.<sup>2,3</sup> One study was a longitudinal study of 538 children who received therapeutic acetaminophen,<sup>2</sup> and one randomized vaccine recipients to receive either a single dose of acetaminophen (75 mg) at 4 hours post-vaccine (n=133) or placebo (n=130).<sup>3</sup><br><br>Additionally, several studies in adults (including healthcare workers, healthy elderly, and ill elderly) receiving seasonal influenza virus vaccines have reported that acetaminophen administration did not alter antibody response.<sup>4,5,6</sup><br><br>The proposed mechanism for an acetaminophen-vaccine interaction involves acetaminophen suppression of the inflammatory response, which is an important component of the host response to vaccine administration.<sup>1</sup> The reason for the discrepancy between the one positive (i.e., interaction does exist) and 5 negative (no interaction) studies is unclear. The degree to which specific vaccines are differentially impacted by this possible interaction is also uncertain, but the study reporting evidence of an interaction is the only to evaluate pneumococcal or <i>H. influenzae</i>, while 3 have studied DTP (mixed findings) and 3 have studied influenza (all reporting no interaction).</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Patients with additional risk factors present (e.g., older age, female sex, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, heart disease, and higher drug concentrations), would be at a substantially higher risk for these potentially life-threatening toxicities. Any use of this combination should be accompanied by close monitoring for evidence of QT prolongation or other alterations of cardiac rhythm, as well as for other signs/symptoms of pazopanib-related toxicity.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> According to pazopanib prescribing information, pazopanib AUC and maximum serum concentrations were each increased an average of 50-60% when pazopanib (800 mg) and lapatinib (1500 mg) were used in combination.<sup>1</sup> This apparent pharmacokinetic interaction is of potentially considerable clinical significance since both drugs are also considered moderate risk QTc-prolonging agents. These drugs are considered “moderate risk” because their level of risk does not merit inclusion in the highest risk group and they meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) clinical trials demonstrate that use of the drug at therapeutic doses is associated with a prolongation of the mean QT/QTc to more that 500 msec and/or a mean change from baseline in the QT/QTc of more than 60 msec; (2) approved drug labeling recommends special monitoring of the QT (or ECG) in order to detect prolongation of the QT/QTc and/or development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias such as torsades de pointes (TdP); (3) approved drug labeling describes the drug as having a clinically meaningful QT-prolonging effect (at therapeutic doses) and/or recommends special caution when combined with other drugs capable of prolonging the QT interval; or (4) the drug is listed in the highest risk category (i.e., “Drugs with a Risk”) on the QTdrugs.org website,<sup>2</sup> which is an extensive listing of QTc-related information maintained by The University of Arizona Health Sciences.<br><br>Several drugs have been associated with the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, including most notably the polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia torsades de pointes (TdP). Prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG is currently the best available biomarker to assess the risk for development of TdP or other ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, QT-prolongation is not a perfect indicator of risk as not all QT-prolonging drugs increase the risk for TdP, there is considerable variability in patient sensitivity to QT prolongation, and the QT interval is difficult to measure accurately and is subject to considerable beat-to-beat variability.<sup>3,4,5,6</sup> Despite the limitations of the QT interval as a biomarker for TdP risk, there is a general association between QT-prolongation and risk for TdP. Among patients with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), each 10 msec increase in the rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval is associated with a 5-7% exponential increase in risk for TdP, and a QTc of over 500 msec is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in TdP risk.<sup>3</sup> The risk of drug-induced QT prolongation and TdP is thought to be similar to these shown with congenital LQTS. According to an FDA Guidance for Industry regarding QT/QTc assessment, QT interval increases of 5 msec or less are generally considered to indicate no increase in TdP risk, while increases of 5 to less than 20 msec indicate a possible increase in risk and increases of 20 msec or more indicate a substantially increased risk.<sup>4</sup><br><br>Many risk factors that may increase a patient's risk for TdP development associated with the use of QT-prolonging drugs have been indentified. Factors known to increase patient's risk include female sex, age over 65 years, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, underlying heart disease, higher concentrations of one or more QT-prolonging drugs, and genetic predisposition.<sup>3,4,5,6</sup><br><br>Although the risks associated with higher serum concentrations of a QT-prolonging drug have been well characterized (e.g., terfenadine drug interactions leading to its withdrawal from the U.S. market), the specific risks associated with concurrent use of multiple QT-prolonging drugs (apart from a pharmacokinetic interaction) has not been well-described. In one review of 70 patients who experienced QT prolongation with IV haloperidol, 68 (97%) patients had other risk factors for QT prolongation, and concurrent use of another QT-prolonging drug was the most common risk factor identified.<sup>7</sup><br><br>The suspected mechanism of this apparent pharmacokinetic interaction is lapatinib-mediated inhibition of pazopanib metabolism/transport via CYP3A4, p-glycoprotein, and/or ABCG2 (aka, BCRP). Pazopanib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and transported by both p-glycoprotein and ABCG2, and lapatinib is a known inhibitor (generally considered a moderate inhibitor) of all.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

The authors of this study speculated and evaluated (in vitro) the influence of atovaquone on etoposide metabolism/transport via cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp).

Ketoconazole has been shown in vitro to be a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, and omeprazole, like other proton pump inhibitors, is dependent on both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 for its metabolism.<sup>4,5,6</sup> The reason for the different magnitude of the interaction according to CYP2C19 metabolizer status appears to be that poor CYP2C19 metabolizers are more dependent on CYP3A4 for the metabolism of omeprazole (vs. CYP2C19 due to the genetic variation). The clinical impact of this interaction is unknown.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Clinical studies suggest sirolimus dose reductions of 50-90% will likely be necessary when starting an azole antifungal. Monitor the serum concentrations and clinical effects of sirolimus closely in all patients receiving ketoconazole or any systemic azole antifungal.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> The AUC of sirolimus (5mg x1) was increased approximately 10-fold in 23 healthy subjects when administered following a 10-day course of ketoconazole (200 mg/day).<sup>1</sup> The sirolimus half-life was unchanged. This observed 10-fold increase in sirolimus AUC is consistent with an in vitro model using human hepatocytes suspended in human plasma that predicted a nearly 9-fold increase in sirolimus AUC with clinically achieved concentrations of ketoconazole.<sup>2</sup> A case series reports intentional use of this interacting combination to decrease sirolimus dose requirements in six kidney transplant recipients.<sup>3</sup> Ketoconazole (100-200mg) was safely used with sirolimus in this population, permitting use of sirolimus doses that were only 1/8 to 1/4 of the pre-ketoconazole dose.<br><br>The likely mechanism of this interaction is ketoconazole inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and/or p-glycoprotein transport of sirolimus. Of note, a study in rats finding that ketoconazole increased the sirolimus AUC by 3-5-fold questioned the role of p-glycoprotein inhibition in this interaction, and suggesting the involvement of an unknown mechanism, including the possible involvement of another sirolimus transporter.<sup>4</sup> Interestingly, other data support the possible involvement of a novel transporter (i.e., besides p-glycoprotein) in sirolimus disposition.<sup>5</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

A disulfiram-like reaction may occur. <b>Severity</b> Major <b>Reliability Rating</b> Good </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Use of alcohol with metronidazole or within 3 days after stopping metronidazole is a listed contraindication in the metronidazole prescribing information. The specific concern is that a disulfiram-like reaction could result from coadministration of alcohol and metronidazole (although evidence currently stands against the development of a true disulfiram-like reaction). Alcohol may be contained in beverages and pharmaceutical products (e.g., elixirs).</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Several case reports describe signs and symptoms of a disulfiram-like reaction during coadministration of alcohol and metronidazole.<sup>1,2,3,4,5,6</sup> Reported reactions have ranged from mild cardiovascular effects to death. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, however, have failed to demonstrate the value of metronidazole as an alcohol aversive agent.<sup>7,8,9,10,11,12</sup> The results of these trials suggest that if a reaction does occur, it will be unpredictable and relatively mild. <br><br>The mechanism of a metronidazole-alcohol interaction, if one does occur, is unclear. A disulfiram-like reaction presumes that metronidazole increases acetaldehyde concentrations by inhibiting acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, thereby inhibiting the metabolism of acetaldehyde to acetic acid. A double-blind study involving 12 normal subjects demonstrated no effect of metronidazole on acetaldehyde concentrations.<sup>13</sup> <br><br>The use of alcohol with metronidazole or within 3 days after stopping metronidazole is a listed contraindication in the metronidazole prescribing information.<sup>14</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
