No such toxicity was seen in 29 patients treated with disulfiram alone. A case report similarly reports psychotic symptoms associated with use of the combination.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Disulfiram is associated with rare development of psychoses. However, the mechanism by which it may contribute to psychosis and the mechanism by which metronidazole or other nitroimidazoles such as benznidazole or tinidazole may enhance this effect are unknown. It has been proposed that both drugs may interfere with dopamine turnover, leading to increased CNS dopamine concentrations.<sup>5</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
