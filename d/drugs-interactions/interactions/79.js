Specifically, the risk for muscle toxicities, including rhabdomyolysis may be significantly increased. <b>Severity</b> Major <b>Reliability Rating</b> Fair: Multiple reported cases, but no apparent mechanism or confirmatory studies </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Avoid concurrent use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) with fusidic acid when possible. If treatment with fusidic acid is necessary, consider temporarily stopping the statin. If the combination can not be avoided, increase monitoring for statin adverse effects, including rhabdomyolysis. Caution patients to promptly report any new or worsening signs/symptoms of possible toxicity (e.g., myalgias).</p>\n<div>\n <p><b>HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins) Interacting Members</b> AtorvaSTATin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, Pitavastatin, Pravastatin, Red Yeast Rice, Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin</p>\n</div> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Several published case reports and case series describe patients who developed rhabdomyolysis, including many fatalities, attributed to an interaction between fusidic acid and simvastatin,<sup>1,2,3,4,5,6,7</sup> atorvastatin,<sup>6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14</sup> or rosuvastatin.<sup>7</sup> In total, these reports describe 27 patients experiencing the consequences of this interaction, and these cases involved wide ranges of statin doses, including doses as low as atorvastatin 10 mg/day, and doses of fusidic acid from 250 mg TID to 500 mg TID. Generally, patients presented in 2-6 weeks after initiation of combination therapy.<br><br>As a result of such reports, concurrent use of systemic fusidic acid with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) is contraindicated in several summaries of product characteristics for fusidic acid.<sup>15,16,17</sup> UK labeling gives a warning that fusidic acid “must not be co-administered with statins,” although it goes on to suggest that use could be considered under exceptional circumstances and with close medical supervision.<sup>18</sup><br><br>The exact mechanism for this interaction is unclear. One report documenting elevated atorvastatin concentrations (despite only a dose of 10 mg/day) suggests that at least some component of the interaction is pharmacokinetic in nature.<sup>6</sup> Though some authors suggest that fusidic acid may be an inhibitor of the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of simvastatin and atorvastatin,<sup>1,2,7</sup> one study examining the effect of fusidic acid on cytochrome P450 activity via administration of the probe compound antipyrine (which is metabolized by approximately 6 different cytochrome P450 enzymes) concluded that short-term (14 days) fusidic acid therapy had no appreciable effect on antipyrine metabolism but that longer-duration (28 days) fusidic acid was associated with increased antipyrine metabolism (clearance of all 3 major metabolites was increased).<sup>19</sup> Similarly, the published report of an interaction involving rosuvastatin, which undergoes very minimal metabolism via CYP3A, also argues against CYP3A inhibition as the primary mechanism of this interaction.<sup>7</sup> Of note, there is some evidence that fusidic acid may be an inhibitor of transporters that mediate biliary efflux (eg, via MRP2 [ABCC2] or BSEP [ABCB11]) and hepatic uptake (eg, via SLCO1B1/OATP1B1) of some statins.<sup>20,21</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

and case series describe potential interactions between systemic fusidic acid and CYP3A4 substrates, including simvastatin,<sup>1,2,3,4,5,6,7</sup> atorvastatin,<sup>6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14</sup> ritonavir,<sup>15</sup> and saquinavir.<sup>15</sup> The fusidic acid summary of product characteristics (SPC) also notes reports of interactions with cyclosporine, which is also a CYP3A4 substrate.<sup>16,17,18</sup><br><br>According to the summary of product characteristics (SPC) for fusidic acid, concurrent use with CYP3A4-metabolized drugs should be avoided due to a risk for possible mutual inhibition of metabolism.<sup>16,17,18</sup><br><br>Though the fusidic acid SPC and the authors of some case reports suggest that fusidic acid may be an inhibitor of CYP3A-mediated metabolism,<sup>1,2,7,15,16,17,18</sup> one study examining the effect of fusidic acid on cytochrome P450 activity via administration of the probe compound antipyrine (which is metabolized by approximately 6 different cytochrome P450 enzymes) concluded that short-term (14 days) fusidic acid therapy had no appreciable effect on antipyrine metabolism but that longer-duration (28 days) fusidic acid was associated with increased antipyrine metabolism (clearance of all 3 major metabolites was increased).<sup>19</sup> Similarly, the published report of an interaction involving rosuvastatin, which undergoes very minimal metabolism via CYP3A, also argues against CYP3A inhibition as the primary mechanism of this interaction.<sup>7</sup> Of note, there is some evidence that fusidic acid may be an inhibitor of the MRP2 (ABCC2) and BSEP (ABCB11) transporters, both of which have been shown to participate in the biliary efflux of rosuvastatin and/or pravastatin in vitro.<sup>20,21,22</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Systemic exposure was significantly reduced with co-administration of MgO compared to gabapentin alone with a decrease in bioavailability of 32%. Omeprazole did not have a significant effect on the bioavailability of gabapentin.<br><br>According to gabapentin prescribing information, concurrent administration of gabapentin and Maalox-brand antacid was associated with an average 20% decrease in gabapentin bioavailability in a study of 16 healthy volunteers.<sup>2</sup> When gabapentin was given 2 hours after the antacid, the average reduction in gabapentin bioavailability was only 5%, leading to the recommendation that gabapentin should be administered at least 2 hours after administration of Maalox-brand antacid. Of note, the prescribing information does not identify which specific antacid product (i.e., calcium carbonate vs. aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide) was used in this study. Until further information is available, this recommendation is likely applicable to all antacid products.<br><br>Additionally, magnesium sulfate prescribing information warns about the potential for additive and excessive CNS depression when used together with CNS depressants.<sup>3,4</sup> Though most low-dose magnesium sulfate may not be associated with CNS depressant effects, magnesium sulfate (primarily given via intravenous [IV] or epidural routes) has been associated with a reduced need for sedatives, anesthetics, and analgesics in several small clinical trials<sup>5,6,7</sup> and published case reports describe patients who have experienced clinically significant CNS depression following the use of magnesium sulfate.<sup>8,9</sup><br><br>The mechanism for the decreased absorption interaction is uncertain although it does not appear to be related to an increase in gastric pH. Formation of a chelate complex is a possible mechanism for this interaction but this has not been clearly established.<sup>1</sup> The specific mechanism for the potential increase in CNS depression is unclear, though both low and high concentrations of magnesium appear to have effects on mood, motor function, and levels of alertness.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

DHEA may increase serum androgen levels, especially at higher doses, resulting in a higher risk of androgenic adverse effects.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is secreted by the adrenal glands and converted to androstenedione and androstenediol which are precursors to testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Testosterone and androstenedione are then subject to aromatization to form estrogens.<sup>1</sup> Most of the conversion to active androgens and estrogens takes place locally in target tissues which may not result in consistent elevation of serum levels of hormones.<sup>2</sup> <br><br>A randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of daily DHEA supplementation (50mg) for 6 months was conducted in 13 men and 17 women aged 40-70 years.<sup>3</sup> Serum levels of DHEA and DHEA sulfate were increased to levels found in young adults within 2 weeks of DHEA supplementation and maintained throughout the duration of supplementation. A small increase in androstenedione levels was observed in men with no change in total testosterone or dihydrotestosterone levels. Conversely, in women, a 2-fold increase in androstenedione, total testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone levels was observed. Another double blind placebo-controlled cross-over study evaluated the effect of DHEA 1,600mg/day in divided doses given to six postmenopausal women for 28 days.<sup>4</sup> Serum levels of androgens were elevated compared to baseline for androstenedione (20-fold), total testosterone (9-fold), and dihydrotestosterone (20-fold). Estrogen levels also showed a 2-fold elevation in these postmenopausal women. <br><br>A meta-analysis of 25 trials demonstrated an overall increase in DHEA sulfate, total testosterone, and estradiol levels with DHEA supplementation in elderly men.<sup>5</sup> A clinical review of DHEA replacement therapy in postmenopausal women also concluded that DHEA is significantly converted to androgens in this population.<sup>6</sup><br><br>Epitestosterone is the inactive by-product of in vivo testosterone synthesis. Normal males have a urinary testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio (T/E) of approximately 1, whereas men receiving exogenous testosterone have a urinary T/E ratio that is much higher.<sup>7</sup> It has been proposed that an elevated T/E ratio may be used to evaluate patients for exogenous testosterone use in sports and the military. In a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of DHEA supplementation on the urinary T/E ratio, seven healthy male subjects were given a 50mg capsule of DHEA daily for 30 days.<sup>8</sup> A 3-hour post-dose urine T/E ratio assessment compared to baseline demonstrated a minimal effect on the T/E ratio. One subject in this study took a 250mg dose of DHEA which resulted in a 40% increase in the urinary T/E ratio. Another study assessed the effect of DHEA supplementation on the T/E ratio in four healthy male subjects.<sup>9</sup> The T/E ratio increased in a dose-dependent fashion in the one subject who took 50mg, 100mg, and 150mg supplements at different times over a 6 month period.<br><br>The evidence for the effect of DHEA supplementation on testosterone levels is conflicting, appears dose-related, and may be different between men and women. Overall, in men, it appears that DHEA supplementation may have a small effect on total testosterone levels, whereas women may experience a more significant relative increase in total testosterone levels. Furthermore, the effect of higher doses sometimes promoted for body building is unknown.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1. Legrain S, Girard L.

NiCARdipine may precipitate signs of heart failure in susceptible patients on Carvedilol NiCARdipine may increase the serum concentration of Carvedilol. <b>Severity</b> Moderate <b>Reliability Rating</b> Fair </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Though concomitant use of nicardipine and carvedilol is probably safe and effective, monitor for increased evidence of hypotension, changes in heart rate, or signs of heart failure.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> In general, concomitant use of beta-blockers and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is safe and advantageous in the treatment of cardiovascular conditions. However, their combined use does carry risk, including hypotension<sup>1,2</sup> and development of signs of heart failure in susceptible patients.<sup>3,4</sup> <br><br>Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may cause increased serum concentrations of some beta-blockers. Diltiazem has been shown to increase the serum concentrations of both propranolol (48%) and metoprolol (33%).<sup>5,6</sup> Verapamil has been reported to increase the serum concentrations of propranolol, metoprolol, and atenolol.<sup>6,7,8,9</sup> The effect of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers on beta-blocker serum concentrations has been more variable.<sup>10,11,12,13</sup> <br><br>A clinical study with the moderate CYP2C9 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor amiodarone reported an approximately 2-fold increase in the concentration of the S(-) enantiomer of carvedilol and the ratio of S/R-carvedilol.<sup>14</sup> Carvedilol prescribing information recommends caution when using carvedilol together with drugs capable of inhibiting CYP2C9 due to the risk for increased concentrations of the S(-) enantiomer of carvedilol.<sup>15</sup> Carvedilol prescribing information also warns that potent CYP2D6 inhibitors would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of carvedilol.<sup>15</sup><br><br>Nicardipine is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C9 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and, as such, might be expected to increase serum concentrations of carvedilol, especially the S(-) enantiomer via CP2C9 inhibition.<sup>16,17</sup> Patients receiving concomitant nicardipine and carvedilol should be monitored for signs of hypotension, changes in heart rate, and signs of heart failure in susceptible patients.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
