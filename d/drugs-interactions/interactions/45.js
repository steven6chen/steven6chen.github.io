Erlotinib solubility is known to be inversely related to gastric pH (i.e., solubility decreases with increasing pH).<sup>1</sup> Due to the prolonged effect of proton pump inhibitors and H2-antagonists on gastric pH, erlotinib prescribing information recommends using antacids as an alternative, provided that the administration of the antacid and erlotinib are separated by several hours.<sup>1</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. Patients at risk for renal impairment should undergo routine monitoring of renal function and serum phosphorous levels.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> According to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate US prescribing information, concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg daily) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg twice daily) increased tenofovir AUC and minimum concentration by an average of 32% and 51%, respectively in a study of healthy subjects (n=24).<sup>1</sup> The mechanism behind this apparent interaction is unclear. Lopinavir and ritonavir both inhibit CYP3A4; however, neither tenofovir disoproxil (prodrug) nor tenofovir (active drug) are known to undergo CYP-mediated metabolism.<sup>1,2</sup> Lopinavir/ritonavir has also been shown to be a possible inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp),<sup>3</sup> but while tenofovir disoproxil is a substrate of P-gp, active tenofovir is primarily eliminated by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. <br><br>In a study of HIV-infected individuals (n=146) concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with a protease inhibitor (PI) [most commonly lopinavir/ritonavir], resulted in a greater decline in renal function (-13.9 ml/min) as measured by estimated creatinine clearance when compared to concomitant tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy (NNRTI) (-6.24 ml/min) or non-tenofovir containing therapy (-6.02 ml/min).<sup>4</sup> Other than baseline HIV-1 load, factors such as age, race, gender, or baseline creatinine clearance were not significantly associated with renal function decline. In another study of HIV-infected individuals (n=30), average tenofovir renal clearance decreased 17.5% in individuals (n=15) receiving concomitant lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg twice daily) versus individuals receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg daly) without PI therapy.<sup>5</sup> Whether these reported increases in tenofovir nephrotoxicity are simply related to increased tenofovir concentrations/exposure and/or represent a unique interaction mechanism are uncertain. Some in vitro studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the mrp4 transporter increased tenofovir renal tubular intracellular concentrations.<sup>6</sup> Of note, tenofovir kidney concentrations in mrp4 knockout mice (i.e., lacking the gene coding for mrp4) were found to be 2-fold greater than in wild-type mice.<sup>7</sup> It is unknown to what extent, if any, lopinavir and/or ritonavir impact mrp4 activity; although, both drugs are known inhibitors of other related (i.e., ABC-type) transporters.<sup>3,8</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Following progressive worsening of liver function, the patient experienced a cardiac arrest and died. Imatinib U.S. prescribing information also describes a case of fatal liver failure in a patient receiving imatinib with acetaminophen, although it is not clear whether this case is different from one described in the published report.<sup>2</sup> Fatal liver toxicity has also been described during use of a different tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, together with acetaminophen and levothyroxine.<sup>3</sup> The authors propose that concurrent use of sunitinib and acetaminophen may have had a significant role in the development of hepatotoxicity, although levothyroxine appeared to be the immediate precipitant. <br><br>The mechanism by which certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors may interact with acetaminophen to increase the risk of hepatotoxicity is uncertain. A study in mice found evidence of enhanced hepatotoxicity during administration of imatinib with acetaminophen compared to either drug alone, in support of a potential interaction.<sup>4</sup> Imatinib inhibits acetaminophen metabolism (via O-glucuronidation) in vitro,<sup>2,5</sup> although in a clinical study the coadministraiton of imatinib (400 mg/day for 8 days) with a single dose of acetaminophen (1,000 mg) had no impact on pharmacokinetic variables of either drug.<sup>2,6</sup> A pharmacodynamic mechanism of interaction is also possible. An in vitro study of dasatinib metabolism concluded that dasatinib metabolism results in the formation of a highly reactive intermediate, similar to that formed from acetaminophen metabolism.<sup>7</sup> Formation of such a reactive metabolite could result in excessive hepatocellular damage, particularly when given with another hepatotoxic agent such as acetaminophen.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

The pressor effects of IV epinephrine, IV norepinephrine, and IV phenylephrine were markedly increased in several reports when administered to patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), agents that similarly block norepinephrine reuptake.<sup>6,7,8,9,10</sup> <br><br>Use of vasoconstrictors such as epinephrine in dental procedures is common. Intraoral injection of 4.4mL of lidocaine/epinephrine (2%/1:80,000) in cardiac transplant patients (n=10) caused a significant increase in heart rate though no significant changes to blood pressure were observed.<sup>11</sup> In a study of healthy males (n=12), intraoral injection of epinephrine (20 mcg or 80 mcg) caused statistically significant changes in heart rate, no change in systolic blood pressure (SBP), and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Additionally, 15 minutes after administration of the 80 mcg dose, epinephrine plasma levels were 10-fold higher than baseline. <sup>12</sup> As such, use of vasoconstrictors in SNRI treated patients undergoing dental procedures may warrant caution, particularly in those individuals with compromised cardiac function.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Warfarin dose may need to be substantially adjusted.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Warfarin dose requirements increased approximately 2-fold within weeks of starting ritonavir, zidovudine, and clarithromycin in a 27 year old patient.<sup>1</sup> Shortly after discontinuation of the ritonavir, the patient's INR increased significantly, and warfarin dose requirements decreased towards prior levels.

Several case reports describe patients who experienced decreases in INR and required increased warfarin doses following initiation of therapy including lopinavir-ritonavir.<sup>3,4,5</sup> The increase in warfarin dose requirements was relatively substantial, with an approximately 4-fold increase noted in one case.<sup>3</sup> The degree to which these effects were due to lopinavir versus ritonavir is unclear.<br><br>The mechanism of this possible interaction is uncertain but appears to be due to induction of warfarin metabolism (mediated primarily by CYP2C9, with notable involvement of several other cytochromes P450). After a single warfarin dose (5mg) S-warfarin concentrations were non-significantly increased by 9% (90% CI: -17% to 44%) and R-warfarin concentrations were significantly decreased by 33% (-38% to -27%) by 12 days of therapy with ritonavir 400mg BID (n=12).<sup>6</sup> A study of the cytochrome P450 effects of lopinavir/ritonavir (400mg/100mg BID x 10 days) in 14 healthy volunteers found that the lopinavir/ritonavir combination modestly induced CYP2C9 (by 29%), CYP1A2 (43%), and CYP2C19 (100%), with an inhibitory effect only noted on CYP3A4 activity.<sup>7</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Both the clinical significance of this interaction and differences in risk among the individual calcium channel blockers are uncertain.</p>\n<div>\n <p><b>Calcium Channel Blockers Interacting Members</b> AmLODIPine, Barnidipine, Benidipine, Bepridil, Cilnidipine, DilTIAZem, Efonidipine, Felodipine, Isradipine, Lacidipine, Lercanidipine, Manidipine, NiCARdipine, NIFEdipine, Nilvadipine, NiMODipine, Nisoldipine, Nitrendipine, Verapamil<br><b>Exception</b> Clevidipine</p>\n</div> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> In a study of 200 patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention whose response to clopidogrel was being measured, those patients using a calcium channel blocker (CCB; n=45: amlodipine-35, nitrendipine-3, nifedipine-3, nisoldipine-1, diltiazem-3) exhibited greater platelet reactivity (platelet reactivity index: 61% vs. 48%, p=0.001) and significantly greater (by 30%, p=0.046) ADP-induced platelet aggregation than those not receiving a CCB.<sup>1</sup> Additionally, 25% of those taking a CCB experienced the primary composite clinical endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, or revascularization, versus only 8% of those not taking a CCB (adjusted HR=3.5, 95% CI: 1.4-8.6). Of note, most of the difference in clinical outcome was due to differences in the need for revascularization. Due to the relatively small number of patients using CCBs other than amlodipine, a robust comparison of CCBs was not possible. Platelet reactivity decreased by approximately 10% from baseline after discontinuation of CCB in a study of 30 subjects receiving both a CCB (63.3% of subjects on amlodipine) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day).<sup>2</sup> While the magnitude of this effect may be of questionable clinical significance, 9 of the 11 subjects with platelet reactivity indicative of high on treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) experienced a reduction in platelet reactivity, and this reduction was to below the HTPR threshold in 7 subjects. Another study evaluating clopidogrel response in patients taking a CCB found only a nonsignificant decrease in response among patients taking nifedipine.<sup>3</sup> The percent inhibition of platelet aggregration following 7 days of clopidogrel (75 mg daily) was 31% in patients also taking nifedipine (n=6) and 28% in patients also taking both nifedipine and atenolol (n=8) as compared to 39% in patients taking just atenolol (n=8). These responses were not considered to be of clinical significance.<br><br>The likely mechanism of any potential interaction would be CCB-mediated inhibition of the metabolic activation of clopidogrel considering that most CCBs are substrates for and/or known inhibitors of CYP3A4, one of the enzymes believed responsible for the activation of clopidogrel. CYP2C19 genotype did not influence the inhibitory effect of CCBs on the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel in one study.<sup>2</sup> An in vitro portion of one clinical study found no evidence that the CCBs exert any direct effect on platelet reactivity.<sup>1</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Both enhanced anti-tumor effects and greater toxicity of 5-fluorouracil in combination with leucovorin calcium/levoleucovorin result from this same mechanism.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

As proposed in the case report, competition for renal transport sites within the proximal tubule, with a subsequent rise in serum concentrations of either agent, may be responsible.<sup>1</sup> Both memantine and trimethoprim do undergo renal clearance via active tubular secretion,<sup>2,3</sup> and both are substrates for organic cation transporter-2 (OCT2),<sup>4,5,6</sup> resulting in an opportunity for an interaction to occur. Another possible mechanism involves more of a pharmacodynamic explanation, considering that both memantine<sup>7</sup> and the related compound amantadine<sup>8</sup> have been reported to cause myoclonus (independent of a known drug-drug interaction) as has TMP/SMX.<sup>9</sup> Additionally, decreased dopamine levels as a result of trimethoprim therapy could possibly contribute to motor function impairment with subsequent adverse events. An additional possible mechanism to consider is a drug-disease interaction, whereby alkalinization of the urine by bacteria (i.e., urinary tract infection, as in the case report,<sup>1</sup> or even asymptomatic bacturia) results in impaired clearance and increased serum concentrations of memantine, whose clearance is significantly decreased with increased urine pH.<sup>2</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Nelfinavir solubility is reportedly pH dependent, with decreased solubility at pH greater than 4.0, creating a potential interaction with any potent acid-reducing agents, such as proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) or histamine-2 antagonists (e.g., ranitidine).<sup>1,2</sup> Additionally, inhibition of the CYP2C19-mediated metabolism of nelfinavir into its active M8 metabolite by omeprazole, which is a substrate for and inhibitor of CYP2C19, likely also contributes to this interaction, and particularly to the observed changes in M8 concentrations (and the M8 to nelfinavir ratio).<sup>1,3</sup> Considering this dual mechanism, it is expected that acid-reducers without a strong impact on CYP2C19 activity (e.g., histamine-2 antagonists) would interact to a lesser degree with nelfinavir. Among the proton pump inhibitors, most/all agents appear to be substrates for CYP2C19 to at least some degree, so all would be expected to interact with nelfinavir in a manner consistent with that of omeprazole, but the inhibitory effect on CYP2C19 (and thus, the interaction magnitude) may vary among individual agents.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
