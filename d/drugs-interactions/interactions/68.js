Consider using a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or an H<sub>2</sub>-antagonist (e.g., famotidine) that doesn't moderately or strongly inhibit CYP2C19 and/or CYP3A4, to avoid the risk of escitalopram toxicity. It is not clear the degree to which other PPIs are less potent CYP2C19 inhibitors than omeprazole; other than cimetidine, which is a potential CYP2C19 and/or CYP3A inhibitor, the other H<sub>2</sub>-antagonists are unlikely to significantly inhibit CYP2C19 or CYP3A. Escitalopram Canadian product labeling recommends a maximum escitalopram dose of 10 mg/day when used concomitantly with omeprazole. No similar recommendation is found in escitalopram U.S. product labeling.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Citalopram is a racemic mixture of (+)-R and (+)-(S) enantiomers (this latter isomer also known as escitalopram). In a study of 16 healthy volunteers, coadministration of omeprazole (30 mg/day for 6 days) increased the escitalopram (20 mg single dose on day 5) AUC by 51% and prolonged its half-life by roughly 8 hours (from around 27 to 35 hours).<sup>1</sup> In a second study of 9 healthy volunteers, the AUC of escitalopram was approximately 120% higher with concurrent use of omeprazole (20 mg/day x 18 days) and citalopram (20 mg single dose on day 8) compared to citalopram alone.<sup>2</sup> In a third study, geriatric patients treated concomitantly with escitalopram (10 mg daily) and omeprazole (20 mg daily) had an estimated 30-34 msec average increase in QTc interval,<sup>3</sup> which compares to an estimated QTc interval prolongation of less than 5 msec in previous studies of the same escitalopram dose given without omeprazole.<sup>4,5</sup><br><br>CYP3A4 and 2C19 are primarily responsible for the metabolism of escitalopram<sup>5</sup> and the likely mechanism for the observed interactions is omeprazole mediated inhibition of CYP2C19. Escitalopram Canadian product labeling recommends limiting escitalopram to 10 mg/day when used concomitantly with omeprazole.<sup>6</sup> No similar recommendation is found in the U.S. product labeling.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Considering both the potential risks of this combination and the potential risks associated with untreated opioid dependence, a recent FDA safety alert recommends that patients should not be excluded from treatment with methadone or buprenorphine for opioid dependence due to concomitant use of CNS depressants.<sup>5</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1. <i>Suboxone</i> (buprenorphine/naloxone) [prescribing information].

Prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG is currently the best available biomarker to assess the risk for development of TdP or other ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, QT-prolongation is not a perfect indicator of risk as not all QT-prolonging drugs increase the risk for TdP, there is considerable variability in patient sensitivity to QT prolongation, and the QT interval is difficult to measure accurately and is subject to considerable beat-to-beat variability.<sup>1,2,3,4</sup> Despite the limitations of the QT interval as a biomarker for TdP risk, there is a general association between QT-prolongation and risk for TdP. Among patients with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), each 10 msec increase in the rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval is associated with a 5-7% exponential increase in risk for TdP, and a QTc of over 500 msec is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in TdP risk.<sup>1</sup> The risk of drug-induced QT prolongation and TdP is thought to be similar to these shown with congenital LQTS. According to an FDA Guidance for Industry regarding QT/QTc assessment, QT interval increases of 5 msec or less are generally considered to indicate no increase in TdP risk, while increases of 5 to less than 20 msec indicate a possible increase in risk and increases of 20 msec or more indicate a substantially increased risk.<sup>2</sup><br><br>Many risk factors that may increase a patient's risk for TdP development associated with the use of QT-prolonging drugs have been identified.

The drugs listed here as “indeterminate risk or risk modifying” are defined as such because their level of risk does not merit inclusion in a higher risk group and they meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) small number of individual reports of QT prolongation and/or TdP associated with the drug, but role of drug (at usual doses) in the event(s) is/are uncertain; (2) clinical study data that suggest a possible QT-prolonging effect, but such an effect is only observed under circumstances not consistent with usual use of the drug (e.g., supratherapeutic doses or concentrations) or when such QT prolongation is of unlikely clinical significance (e.g., mean prolongation of 5 msec or less); or (3) drug whose independent QT effects are unclear but whose use is known or suspected to increase the QT-prolonging effect of drugs with known QT-prolonging effects (e.g., via electrolyte changes, bradycardic effects, etc.).<br><br>Several drugs have been associated with the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, including most notably the polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia torsades de pointes (TdP). Prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG is currently the best available biomarker to assess the risk for development of TdP or other ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, QT-prolongation is not a perfect indicator of risk as not all QT-prolonging drugs increase the risk for TdP, there is considerable variability in patient sensitivity to QT prolongation, and the QT interval is difficult to measure accurately and is subject to considerable beat-to-beat variability.<sup>2,3,4,5</sup> Despite the limitations of the QT interval as a biomarker for TdP risk, there is a general association between QT-prolongation and risk for TdP. Among patients with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), each 10 msec increase in the rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval is associated with a 5-7% exponential increase in risk for TdP, and a QTc of over 500 msec is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in TdP risk.<sup>2</sup> The risk of drug-induced QT prolongation and TdP is thought to be similar to these shown with congenital LQTS. According to an FDA Guidance for Industry regarding QT/QTc assessment, QT interval increases of 5 msec or less are generally considered to indicate no increase in TdP risk, while increases of 5 to less than 20 msec indicate a possible increase in risk and increases of 20 msec or more indicate a substantially increased risk.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Many risk factors that may increase a patient's risk for TdP development associated with the use of QT-prolonging drugs have been indentified. Factors known to increase patient's risk include female sex, age over 65 years, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, underlying heart disease, higher concentrations of one or more QT-prolonging drugs, and genetic predisposition.<sup>2,3,4,5</sup><br><br>Although the risks associated with higher serum concentrations of a QT-prolonging drug have been well characterized (e.g., terfenadine drug interactions leading to its withdrawal from the U.S. market), the specific risks associated with concurrent use of multiple QT-prolonging drugs (apart from a pharmacokinetic interaction) has not been well-described.

For patients taking erythromycin (500 mg twice daily), a single avanafil dose (200 mg) was associated with a 3-fold increase in AUC, a 2-fold increase in Cmax, and an increase in half-life from 5 hours to 8 hours.<sup>1</sup> A similar effect would be expected for other moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as fluconazole). Based on these data, the avanafil prescribing information recommends a maximum avanafil dose of 50 mg, not more than once per 24 hours (when being used with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors).<sup>1</sup><br><br>The mechanism for this interaction is fluconazole inhibition of avanafil metabolism. Avanafil is metabolized predominately by CYP3A4, with CYP2C playing a minor role.<sup>1</sup> Fluconazole is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a strong CYP2C9 inhibitor. Other phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are also primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, and most azole antifungals are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (which are contraindicated for concurrent use with avanafil), suggesting that a similar interaction could be expected with most PDE5 inhibitor-azole antifungal combinations; therefore, caution is advised when considering using any members of these classes concurrently.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Apixaban product labeling recommends that use with any strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp should be avoided.<sup>1,2</sup> While several strong CYP3A4 inducers have also been identified as inducers of P-gp, several others have not been studied or have an unknown impact on the disposition of P-gp substrates in humans. Unless data clearly indicate a lack of P-gp induction effect by a strong CYP3A4 inducer, use with apixaban should be avoided whenever possible.<br><br>In contrast to these data suggesting decreased apixaban effects with concurrent use of inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, the use of rifampin or phenytoin was associated with a 1.57- or 1.94-fold increase in incidence rate ratio for major bleeding according a large retrospective cohort study of 91,330 Taiwanese patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who were treated with apixaban (14.11% of participants) or another non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (ie, dabigatran or rivaroxaban).<sup>4</sup> Concurrent rifampin or phenytoin was associated with an increase of 36.9 and 52.3 major bleeding episodes per 1000 person-years. While a secondary analysis of each anticoagulant individually generally yielded similar results to the overall analysis, concurrent rifampin was associated with a decreased incidence of major bleeding with apixaban in that analysis; concurrent phenytoin was still associated with an increase in major bleeding with apixaban in this secondary analysis. Several other examined combinations also yielded findings contrary to what would be expected based on available pharmacokinetic interaction data or known pharmacology of the drugs in question. The precise clinical meaning of these findings is unclear, but increased monitoring of patients for evidence of either a decreased or an increased anticoagulant response seems to be warranted.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

The colchicine prescribing information classifies fosamprenavir as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.<sup>1</sup> <br><br>Several case reports describe severe episodes of colchicine toxicity (including gastrointestinal symptoms, hematologic abormalities, neuropathies, myopathies) associated with concurrent use of colchicine with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin, some of which have been fatal.<sup>3,4,5,6,7</sup><br><br>One case-control study of 88 patients who had received concurrent colchicine and clarithromycin and 28 patients who received sequential colchicine and clarithromycin reported 9 (10.2%) fatalities in the concurrent group versus only 1 (3.6%) in the sequential group.<sup>8</sup> An analysis to identify risk factors for a fatal interaction identified a longer duration of treatment overlap (relative risk (RR) = 2.2), baseline renal impairment (RR = 9.1), and the development of pancytopenia (RR = 23.4) as significant predictors of a fatal interaction.<br><br>Data presented in colchicine prescribing information indicate that concurrent administration of colchicine (0.6 mg x1) with clarithromycin (250 mg BID x 7 days; n=23) was associated with a 282% increase in mean colchicine AUC and a 227% increase in mean colchicine maximum serum concentration (Cmax).<sup>1</sup> Data with other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, ketoconazole (200 mg BID x 5 days; n=24), and ritonavir (100 mg BID x 5 days; n=18), show a 212% and 296% increase in colchicine AUC, respectively, and a 102% and 184% increase in colchicine Cmax, respectively.<sup>1</sup><br><br>Considering that CYP3A4 has a large role in colchicine metabolism, the likely mechanism of these interactions is inhibition of CYP3A4-dependent colchicine metabolism. However, since many CYP3A4 inhibitors are also inhibitors of p-glycoprotein-mediated transport and colchicine is a p-glycoprotein substrate, inhibition of p-glycoprotein may also be (at least somewhat) responsible.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours is not an adequate adjustment for the effects of concurrent efavirenz. Though not specifically recommended in either the efavirenz or indinavir prescribing information, several studies suggest that ritonavir-boosted indinavir at a dose of indinavir 800 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg, given twice daily, in combination with efavirenz yields indinavir concentrations that are at least equivalent with those obtained with indinavir 800 mg three times daily without efavirenz. Monitor patient clinical response to antiviral therapy closely with use of this combination, including monitoring for both inadequate antiviral response and evidence of possible toxicity.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> When indinavir 1000 mg every 8 hours was given with efavirenz (600 mg/day), average indinavir AUC and minimum serum concentrations (Cmin) were 33-46% and 39-57% lower, respectively, as compared to concentrations obtained with indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours alone.<sup>1</sup> Consequently, the efavirenz prescribing information notes that this increased indinavir dose is not adequate to account for the interaction between indinavir and efavirenz.<br><br>Although no specific indinavir dose adjustment is recommended, several other studies conclude that the use of ritonavir-boosted indinavir (800 mg indinavir plus 100 mg ritonavir, given twice daily) provides indinavir minimum serum concentrations (Cmin) with concurrent efavirenz that are at least equivalent to those obtained with indinavir 800 mg three times daily without efavirenz.<sup>2,3,4</sup> Of note, one small study in 5 subject concluded that even lower ritonavir-boosted indinavir doses may be both effective and less toxic.<sup>5</sup> All 5 subjects receiving the 800/100 mg twice daily indinavir/ritonavir doses with efavirenz displayed serum indinavir concentrations that exceeded a predefined toxicity threshold, as compared to 2 of 5 subjects receiving a 600/100 mg dose and zero of 5 of those receiving a 400/100 mg dose. None of the subjects at any of the tested doses displayed indinavir Cmins that were deemed subtherapeutic.<br><br>The likely mechanism(s) for this interaction involves efavirenz induction of the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of indinavir.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
