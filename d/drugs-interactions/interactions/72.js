If this combination must be used, monitor clinical response to atovaquone closely, looking specifically for evidence of reduced clinical effectiveness.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> The atovaquone AUC was an average of 75% lower in HIV-positive patients (n=20) stable on efavirenz (600 mg/day) than in healthy volunteers (n=18) when both groups were given a single dose of atovaquone/proguanil (250 mg/100 mg).<sup>1</sup> Although there were some notable differences between these study groups (HIV-status, HIV-positive patients were significantly older and more likely to be smokers), the magnitude of the observed difference suggests that a significant interaction may be likely. In another study of HIV-positive patients, atovaquone regimens (750 mg twice daily and 1500 mg twice daily) were administered to 10 patients taking efavirenz based antiretroviral therapy (600 mg daily) and to 10 patients not taking antiretroviral therapy.<sup>2</sup> Atovaquone AUC was 44% to 47% lower in patients taking efavirenz compared with AUC in patients not taking antiretroviral therapy.<sup>2</sup> When subjects took 750 mg twice daily of atovaquone, average atovaquone concentrations greater than 15 mcg/mL (a threshold associated with successful treatment of <i>Pneumocystis jiroveci</i> pneumonia) were seen in only 50% of efavirenz-treated patients, while atovaquone concentrations greater than 15 mcg/mL were seen in 100% of patients not taking antiretroviral therapy.<sup>2</sup> Use of atovaquone 1500 mg twice daily achieved atovaquone concentrations greater than 15 mcg/mL in all patients.<sup>2</sup><br><br>Product labeling for efavirenz states that use with atovaquone should be avoided due to the risk of decreased atovaquone concentrations and effects.<sup>3</sup> Prescribing information for atovaquone and atovaquone/proguanil does not describe a specific interaction with efavirenz, but does state that concurrent use with rifampin or rifabutin, which decrease atovaquone AUC by 34% to 50%, is not recommended.<sup>4,5</sup> Conversely, <i>CDC Health Information for International Travel</i> (also known as the Yellow Book) states that although efavirenz decreases the exposure of both atovaquone and proguanil, there is no evidence supporting clinical failure with concurrent use of efavirenz and prophylactic atovaquone/proguanil.<sup>6</sup><br><br>The specific mechanism for this observed interaction is not clear. Atovaquone is not appreciably metabolized but is eliminated in the bile, via an apparently active process.<sup>4,5,7</sup> Whether efavirenz induces this process, alters atovaquone protein binding (more than 99% bound), and/or interacts via another route is uncertain. The authors of these studies hypothesize that efavirenz may induce the glucuronidation of atovaquone.<sup>1,2</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1. van Luin M, Van der Ende ME, Richter C, et al.

Patients receiving concomitant therapy should be monitored closely and concomitant therapy should be discontinued immediately with signs/symptoms of muscle toxicity. In patients who may be predisposed to myopathy (e.g., those with preexisting renal impairment, severe infection, trauma, surgery, hormonal or electrolyte imbalance, high ethanol intake), concomitant use of bezafibrate with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is contraindicated and alternative therapy should be considered.</p>\n<div>\n <p><b>HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins) Interacting Members</b> AtorvaSTATin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, Pitavastatin, Pravastatin, Red Yeast Rice, Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin</p>\n</div> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Both the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates have been associated with muscle toxicities (including rhabdomyolysis) in monotherapy, and the risk may be greater when these agents are used in combination. In a review of published case reports of rhabdomyolysis associated with fibrate therapy, gemfibrozil was associated with the greatest number of events followed by bezafibrate, fenofibrate, ciprofibrate, and clofibrate.<sup>1</sup> Of the 17 cases associated with bezafibrate, 3 cases were reported in patients receiving concomitant HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. <br><br>The precise mechanism by which concomitant use of bezafibrate and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may lead to myopathy is uncertain. Some in vivo and in vitro studies have failed to demonstrate a pharmacokinetic interaction between bezafibrate and the metabolizing enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4, 2C8) and/or transporters (e.g., Organic Anion Polypeptide Transporter1B1, P-glycoprotein) that participate in the uptake and/or elimination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.<sup>2,3,4,5</sup> Fluvastatin Canadian product monograph however describes a pharmacokinetic study where concomitant fluvastatin (20 mg once daily) and bezafibrate (200 mg TID) increased mean fluvastatin AUC and Cmax by 50-60%, but also states that myopathy was not reported in short-term studies with concomitant bezafibrate and fluvastatin (40-60 mg/day).<sup>6</sup> Some short term studies demonstrated similar risks of myopathy in patients receiving bezafibrate with fluvastatin<sup>7</sup> or with simvastatin when compared to monotherapy,<sup>8</sup> although creatinine phosphokinase levels reportedly ~50% from baseline with concomitant bezafibrate and simvastatin.<sup>8</sup> <br><br>Bezafibrate Canadian product monograph recommends limiting concomitant use with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to exceptional cases where it is strictly indicated and specifically contraindicates concomitant use in patients who may be predisposed to myopathy (e.g., preexisting renal impairment, trauma, surgery, severe infection, hormonal or electrolyte imbalance, high ethanol intake).<sup>9</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

At least some non-US labeling recommends avoiding all such combinations.

The precise clinical meaning of these findings is unclear.<br><br>In a clinical study summarized in apixaban US and Canadian product labeling, coadministration of ketoconazole (400 mg daily) increased the apixaban maximum concentration (Cmax) and AUC by 1.6- and 2-fold, respectively.<sup>2,3</sup> This interaction is presumed to result from ketoconazole inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux of apixaban. Apixaban US prescribing information includes recommendations for apixaban dose adjustment or avoidance when combined with ketoconazole and other drugs that strongly inhibit both CYP3A4 and P-gp; the apixaban Canadian product monograph states that any use with such inhibitors is contraindicated.<sup>2,3</sup> No recommendations regarding the use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors that do not affect P-glycoprotein are provided. However, use of even the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor diltiazem (which has no known substantial impact on P-gp function) increased apixaban Cmax and AUC by 1.3- and 1.4- fold, respectively.<sup>2,3</sup> The product labeling for some cobicistat products (darunavir/cobicistat) recommends avoiding the combined use of cobicistat and apixaban.<sup>4</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
