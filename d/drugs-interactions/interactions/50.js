In particular, the risk for CNS toxicities such as psychosis may be increased. <b>Severity</b> Major <b>Reliability Rating</b> Fair </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Concomitant use of metronidazole and disulfiram is contraindicated in the metronidazole prescribing information. Avoid metronidazole use in patients who have received disulfiram within the previous 2 weeks.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Prescribing information for metronidazole notes that psychotic reactions have been reported in patients receiving metronidazole and disulfiram concurrently, and contraindicates the use of metronidazole in patients who have received disulfiram within the previous 2 weeks.<sup>1</sup> In one study, reported in brief, the concomitant use of disulfiram and metronidazole resulted in a high incidence (21%) of CNS toxicities in 29 hospitalized patients.<sup>2,3,4</sup> Symptoms included acute psychoses, confusion, hallucinations, and/or delusions. No such toxicity was seen in 29 patients treated with disulfiram alone. A case report similarly reports psychotic symptoms associated with use of the combination.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Disulfiram is associated with rare development of psychoses. However, the mechanism by which it may contribute to psychosis and the mechanism by which metronidazole may enhance this effect are unknown. It has been proposed that both drugs may interfere with dopamine turnover, leading to increased CNS dopamine concentrations.<sup>5</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Use of multiple antibiotics (particularly those with effectiveness against anaerobic or gram-negative bacteria that produce beta-glucuronidase) may potentiate this effect. Avoid the specific combination of mycophenolate, metronidazole, and norfloxacin.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> In one pharmacokinetic study, the mycophenolic acid (MPA; active metabolite of mycophenolate) AUC after a single mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1g dose was 39% lower following a 5-day course of metronidazole (500mg three times daily) plus norfloxacin (400 mg twice daily) in 11 healthy subjects.<sup>1</sup> The AUC of the MPA glucuronide metabolite (MPAG) was reduced 40%. The AUCs of MPA and MPAG were each reduced 24% following a 5-day course of metronidazole (500mg three times daily) alone, but only the reduction in MPAG reached statistical significance.<sup>1</sup> In a retrospective analysis of data from 117 renal transplant recipients, concurrent therapy with oral metronidazole was one of several factors identified in a statistical model that were independently associated with lower MPA trough concentrations.<sup>2</sup> Of note, 2 other oral antibiotics (amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin) were also identified in this model; no association, however, was seen with any intravenous antibiotics.<br><br>Product labeling for mycophenolate warns that the combination of mycophenolate, metronidazole, and norfloxacin should be avoided.<sup>3</sup><br><br>It is suspected that metronidazole (and other antibiotics) interacts with mycophenolate by killing beta-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestinal tract, thus interfering with bacteria-mediated metabolism of MPAG. Glucuronidases produced by enteric bacteria act on MPAG to liberate active MPA, which is then available for re-absorption as part of the enterohepatic recirculation process that is suspected to contribute to up to 40% of MPA exposure.<sup>1,3</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Both metabolites are less pharmacologically active compared to the parent compound ropivacaine.<sup>2</sup> <br><br>The mechanism of this interaction appears to stem from ciprofloxacin-mediated CYP1A2 inhibition. CYP1A2 is the main metabolic route of elimination for ropivacaine, with CYP3A4 playing a minor role.<sup>2,3</sup> However, in the presence of a CYP1A2 inhibitor (such as ciprofloxacin), the formation of the 3-OH ropivacaine metabolite is reduced but is accompanied by an increase in metabolism by CYP3A4, as evidenced by increased formation of the PPX metabolite. The overall result is a modest decrease in the clearance of ropivacaine. The combination of ciprofloxacin (or any CYP1A2 inhibitor) and a CYP3A4 inhibitor would likely produce greater changes in ropivacaine pharmacokinetics as both pathways of elimination would be inhibited. This effect on ropivacaine pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated with the combination of fluvoxamine (CYP 1A2 inhibitor) and erythromycin (CYP 3A4 inhibitor).<sup>4</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Following a 5-day course of norfloxacin (400mg twice daily) plus metronidazole (500mg three times daily), both MPA AUC(0-48) and MPAG AUC(0-48) were approximately 40% lower than at baseline. <br><br>In a retrospective analysis of data from 121 renal transplant recipients, concurrent therapy with ciprofloxacin was one of several factors identified in a statistical model that were independently associated with MPA trough concentrations.<sup>3</sup> Of note, 2 other antibiotics (amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid and metronidazole) were also identified in this model; no association, however, was seen with any intravenous antibiotics. The association with all three indicated that presence of the antibiotic was associated with a lower MPA trough concentration.<br><br>It is suspected that antibiotics interact with mycophenolate by killing glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestinal tract, thus interfering with bacteria-mediated metabolism of MPAG. Glucuronidases produced by enteric bacteria act on MPAG to liberate active MPA, which is then available for re-absorption as part of the enterohepatic recirculation process that is suspected to contribute to up to 40% of MPA exposure.<sup>1,2</sup> Based on clindamycin antimicrobial activity, it seems prudent to consider a potential similar interaction with mycophenolate.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

The precise mechanism behind the observed changes in dexamethasone clearance is unknown, but the authors suggest that asparaginase-related hypoalbuminemia may reflect a decrease in hepatic proteins involved in the metabolism of dexamethasone and that lower asparaginase doses/exposure (including presence of allergy, which may lead to greater asparaginase inactivation) may result in less of an effect on hepatic proteins and a relatively greater dexamethasone clearance.<sup>1</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Dexamethasone (Systemic) may enhance the thrombogenic effect of Thalidomide. <b>Severity</b> Major <b>Reliability Rating</b> Excellent </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Consider using venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients with multiple myeloma who are receiving both thalidomide and dexamethasone, particularly if the patient is newly diagnosed or has other risk factors for thromboembolism. Low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin (at INR of 2.0-3.0) have been proposed as reasonable prophylactic agents.<sup>1,2</sup> Regarding the potential dermatologic interaction between thalidomide and dexamethasone, monitor for any evidence of dermatologic events, particularly maculopapular or erythematous rash. If evident, discontinuation of drug therapy or dosage reduction may be required.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> As summarized in a review on the issue, considerable evidence from clinical trials shows a several-fold increase in the incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) with combined thalidomide-dexamethasone than with use of either agent alone in patients with multiple myeloma.<sup>1</sup> The results of one meta-analysis estimated that the risk of VTE with combined thalidomide-dexamethasone was increased 8-fold; this is in contrast to the increase in VTE risk associated with each drug used alone (2.6- to 2.8-fold).<sup>2</sup> Of note, this interaction appears to be considerably greater in newly diagnosed patients than in patients who relapse or are refractory, with reported VTE incidence rates with the combination of 14-26% for newly diagnosed patients versus 2-8% for relapsed or refractory patients.<sup>1</sup> This interaction does not appear to be particularly unique to dexamethasone, as melphalan plus prednisone, doxorubicin, and other multiagent chemotherapies also appear to increase VTE incidence when combined with thalidomide.<sup>1</sup> As with dexamethasone, the risk of VTE with these other combinations also appears to be greater in newly diagnosed patients than in relapsed/refractory patients.<sup>1</sup> Patients with malignancies, and in particular hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma, are known to have a higher baseline incidence of VTE, but the mechanism by which dexamethasone and thalidomide interact to increase this risk is unclear.<br><br>A comparative, open-label trial in 87 patients evaluated the occurrence of dermatologic events in multiple myeloma patients treated with thalidomide alone (200 mg/day, up to a maximum of 800 mg/day) or in combination with dexamethasone (40 mg/day, pulsed).<sup>3</sup> Dermatologic events were noted in 46% of patients receiving thalidomide alone, and were primarily minor in severity. Only one patient developed severe, desquamating eruptions that required permanent discontinuation of therapy. Of those patients receiving combined thalidomide and dexamethasone, 43% showed skin toxicity. In contrast to the monotherapy group, 3 patients receiving both treatments developed severe skin reactions requiring hospitalization, one consistent with toxic epidermal necrolyisis presentation. Drug causality is not determined, and no mechansim has been defined for a potential dermatologic interaction between thalidomide and dexamethasone. Given the overall higher occurrence of severe skin reactions in the combined treatment (19%) compared to the monotherapy group (4%), caution and monitoring is warranted with concomitant therapy. Whether or not this phenomenon is likely with other corticosteroids is presently unknown.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

However, in patients with impaired renal function (ie, CrCl 15-80 mL/min) who are receiving rivaroxaban, the US prescribing information warns that moderate inhibitors of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, such as erythromycin, should not be used unless the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. The warning in some non-US labeling is not as strong, though caution is advised, particularly with concurrent use of drugs that can increase rivaroxaban concentrations.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> According to a large retrospective cohort study of 91,330 Taiwanese patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who were treated with rivaroxaban (59.13% of participants) or another non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (ie, dabigatran or apixaban), concurrent use of clarithromycin or erythromycin was associated with a 40% decrease in the incidence rate ratio for major bleeding.<sup>1</sup> Of note, several other combinations examined in this cohort study yielded findings contrary to what would be expected based on available pharmacokinetic interaction data or known pharmacology of the drugs in question. The precise clinical meaning of these findings is unclear.<br><br>Concomitant use of rivaroxaban (10 mg daily) with the moderate CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor erythromycin (500 mg three times/day) resulted in a 30% increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and maximum serum concentration (Cmax).<sup>2,3</sup> As the elimination of rivaroxaban is partially dependent on renal function, the interaction is expected to be of greater severity and significance in patients with impaired renal function.<sup>2</sup> Consistent with this, the rivaroxaban (10 mg single dose) AUC was increased by 76% and 99% in patients with either mildy (CrCl 50-79 mL/min) or moderately (CrCl 30-49 mL/min) impaired renal function who were given erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days), respectively, as compared to patients with normal renal function not receiving erythromycin.<sup>2,4</sup> This apparent interaction is most likely the result of erythromycin-mediated inhibition of both CYP3A4 and P-gp.<sup>2</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
