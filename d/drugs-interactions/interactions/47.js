The authors of this study also noted that additional investigation suggested that zidovudine -- clarithromycin binding (i.e., chelation) did not occur and was not a likely explanation for the observed interaction.<sup>1</sup> Based on these data, both the authors of this study and clarithromycin prescribing information suggest that coadministration of zidovudine and clarithromycin should be avoided and that doses should be staggered when concurrent therapy is required.<sup>1,2</sup> Of note, in addition to this study suggesting a significant pharmacokinetic interaction, a study in mice found evidence of greater hematoxicity (decreased erythrocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) and impaired splenic immune response with combined clarithromycin and zidovudine, as compared to either agent administered alone.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Conversely, zidovudine AUC and minimum serum concentration (Cmin) were not significantly altered when clarithromycin (1000mg Q12h) was administered 2 hours apart from zidovudine (200mg Q8h).<sup>4</sup> Zidovudine Cmax was also increased by approximately 50%, and zidovudine Tmax was approximately 50% lower.
