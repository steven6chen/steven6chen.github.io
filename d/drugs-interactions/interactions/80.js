Similar results were seen in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in which thirty-eight obese diabetics managed with diet or a sulfonylurea were randomized to topiramate or placebo.<sup>5</sup> The topiramate group experienced significant weight loss and an absolute reduction in A1c of 1.11% compared to an increase of 0.31% in the placebo group (p=0.0009). Similar results were also seen in a study of 646 obese diabetic subjects treated with metformin monotherapy and lifestyle modification in which topiramate resulted in a statistically significant reduction in A1c.<sup>10</sup><br><br>Although a pharmacokinetic study demonstrated a small decrease in serum concentrations of glyburide with concomitant topiramate, the combination was well tolerated without significant changes in FPG levels. This may be because the change was not large enough to impact the efficacy of glyburide, there is a poor correlation between glyburide serum levels and efficacy<sup>11</sup>, or topiramate itself has some antihyperglycemic activity. Nevertheless, it may still be prudent to be aware of the interaction and monitor glycemic control if the combination is used.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Monitor patients receiving combination therapy with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and fenofibrate derivatives closely for symptoms of muscle toxicity. Atorvastatin prescribing information recommends immediate discontinuation of both drugs if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.</p>\n<div>\n <p><b>HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins) Interacting Members</b> AtorvaSTATin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, Pitavastatin, Pravastatin, Red Yeast Rice, Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin</p>\n</div> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Both the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates have been associated with muscle toxicities (including rhabdomyolysis) in monotherapy, and data suggest the risk may be considerably greater when these agents are used in combination. Among the fibrates, fenofibrate (ester pro-drug of fenofibric acid) monotherapy has been associated with severe muscle toxicity at a rate of approximately 5.5 cases per million prescriptions. This risk appears to be substantially lower than for gemfibrozil monotherapy (59.6 cases of rhabdomyolysis per million prescriptions).<sup>1</sup><br><br>Similarly, a study of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database found that fenofibrate does not confer the same risk as gemfibrozil when used in combination with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, reporting a risk of rhabdomyolysis at least 15-fold lower with fenofibrate-HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor combinations than with gemfibrozil-HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor combinations.<sup>2</sup> It is important to note, however, that the risk of severe muscle toxicity does appear to be several-fold greater with combination fenofibrate-HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy than with monotherapy,<sup>3</sup> even though fenofibrate does confer a lower risk in combination than gemfibrozil. <br><br>The precise mechanism of this interaction is uncertain, but it appears to involve primarily a pharmacodynamic component. Explaining the observation that fenofibrate has a lower risk of clinically significant interactions with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors than gemfibrozil, fenofibrate does not share gemfibrozil's pharmacokinetic effects, with several studies documenting the lack of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction between fenofibrate and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.<sup>4,5,6,7,8</sup> Data specific to fenofibric acid have similarly concluded that there are no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.9 Data generally show only minor effects (mostly changes of 10% or less) of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on fenofibric acid concentrations, and minor-moderate effects of fenofibric acid on rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics (AUC increased 6% and Cmax increased 20%).<sup>9</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

A second minor metabolic pathway involves the conversion of oxycodone to the active metabolite oxymorphone via CYP2D6.<sup>1,2</sup> Unlike codeine which is 200 times less potent than its CYP2D6 metabolite morphine <sup>3</sup>, oxycodone itself appears to possess significant opioid activity.<sup>1</sup><br><br>Co-administration of a CYP3A4 inhibitor and oxycodone results in increased oxycodone serum concentrations.<sup>4,5,6,7,8,9</sup> Alternate metabolic pathways and the relative contribution of active metabolites to pharmacologic activity make this effect difficult to quantify. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, ten healthy volunteers received oxycodone 0.2mg/kg orally with placebo; quinidine (strong CYP2D6 inhibitor); ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor); or quinidine plus ketoconazole on separate occasions.<sup>4</sup> Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that inhibition of CYP3A4 resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in the oxycodone AUC and an 80% decrease in exposure to the poorly-active metabolites noroxycodone and noroxymorphone. CYP3A4 inhibition also resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in exposure to oxymorphone, presumably due to a shift toward metabolism via CYP2D6. When compared with CYP3A4 inhibition alone, the effect of combined CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibition resulted in a more pronounced effect on oxycodone AUC, increasing exposure by 3.1-fold, and a less pronounced 1.6-fold increase in oxymorphone AUC . <br><br>Another randomized placebo-controlled crossover study of eleven healthy volunteers demonstrated that combined paroxetine (strong CYP2D6 inhibitor) and itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) resulted in a 2.9-fold increase in oxycodone AUC compared to placebo. <sup>5</sup> Paroxetine alone had no significant effect on oxycodone exposure but did decrease oxymorphone AUC by 44%. In a separate study of twelve healthy subjects, the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole was shown to increase the AUC of intravenous oxycodone by 51% and oral oxycodone by 144% while the oxymorphone AUC was increased by 359%.<sup>6</sup> The strong CYP3A4 inhibitor voriconazole also caused a 3.6-fold increase in oxycodone AUC and a 7.3-fold increase in oxymorphone AUC in a study of twelve healthy volunteers.<sup>7</sup> <br><br>The impact on oxycodone pharmacodynamics was also assessed in some of these studies. A companion publication of the study by Samer et al.<sup>4</sup> evaluated the pharmacodynamic effects of single-dose oxycodone and determined that CYP3A4 inhibition consistently increased oxycodone pharmacodynamic effects (nociceptive flexion reflex, cold pressor test, pupil size, psychomotor tests, vital signs, and sedation) compared to placebo.<sup>10</sup> CYP2D6 inhibition alone reduced the analgesic effects of oxycodone, but did not abolish effects on pupil size, psychomotor effects, or cold pressor test. No difference in most pharmacodynamic variables was noted between CYP3A4 inhibition alone vs. combined CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibition. <br><br>Pharmacodynamic effects were also reported in another study as measured by (1) a 100mm visual analog scale (VAS) for alertness/drowsiness, deterioration of performance, and unpleasant/pleasant feeling; (2) pupil diameter and other psychomotor tests; and (3) cold pressor test (to evaluate analgesia).<sup>5</sup> The AUEC(0,6h) for VAS scores for all three variables was increased in the paroxetine + itraconazole group whereas only the AUEC(0,6h) for VAS score for deterioration of performance was increased in the paroxetine alone group. There was no difference in the cold pressor test between groups and assessment of the AUEC(0,12h) of all variables showed no difference between groups.<br><br>CYP3A4 inhibitors significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone, resulting in increased oxycodone and oxymorphone serum concentrations and have shown modest effects on pharmacodynamic variables. Since these studies evaluated a single dose of oxycodone in healthy volunteers, caution must be exercised in sicker patients receiving multiple doses of oxycodone. A retrospective case series of nine cancer patients being treated with oxycodone who received the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor voriconazole revealed that seven of the nine experienced an adverse effect, usually within 1-4 days, of starting voriconazole.<sup>11</sup> Adverse events reported included nausea, vomiting, hypopnea, hypotension, and sweating. One patient reported difficulty with pain control two days after voriconazole was stopped. Prescribing information for oxycodone cautions that concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors can result in elevated serum concentrations of oxycodone and advises more frequent monitoring and dose adjustment.<sup>12</sup> Combined use of a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in a more pronounced elevation of oxycodone serum concentrations, however, because of the variable effects on active metabolites, the impact of dual enzyme inhibition on oxycodone's pharmacodynamics is uncertain.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Eslicarbazepine 1200mg daily was then co-administered over 8 days followed by a 7-day recovery period with warfarin alone. Steady-state pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that eslicarbazepine reduced the S-warfarin AUC by 23% with no effect on R-warfarin exposure. The mean INR value was also not statistically different with warfarin alone compared to warfarin and eslicarbazepine (1.45 vs. 1.51, respectively). The mechanism for this pharmacokinetic interaction with S-warfarin is uncertain. Eslicarbazepine does not significantly induce CYP2C9, <sup>1,2,3</sup> the primary enzyme responsible for S-warfarin metabolism<sup>4</sup> and does not significantly affect protein binding.<sup>2</sup><br><br>In this study, the effect of eslicarbazepine on warfarin serum concentrations was relatively small and the effect on INR values was not clinically relevant. However, it is unclear how INR would be affected by these changes in medically complex patients being maintained at a higher (therapeutic) INR range.

ARIPiprazole may diminish the therapeutic effect of Haloperidol. Haloperidol may increase the serum concentration of ARIPiprazole. <b>Severity</b> Moderate <b>Reliability Rating</b> Fair </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Monitor patient response closely when aripiprazole is used with haloperidol due to potential reduced efficacy of haloperidol, increased aripiprazole systemic exposure, and QTc prolongation. Since haloperidol is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor and a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, dosage adjustment of aripiprazole is advised. <u>For aripiprazole formulations other than the extended-release injectable</u>: consider reducing the initial aripiprazole dose to as little as 25% of the usual dose and titrate based on clinical response. When aripiprazole is being used as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder, it should be administered without dosage adjustment. <br><u>For extended-release injectable aripiprazole</u>: the following dose adjustments are recommended only when a combination of a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor is given for more than 14 days. In patients who would normally receive a 400mg aripiprazole dose, reduce dose to 200mg; in patients who would normally receive a 300mg dose, reduce dose to 160mg. Increase aripiprazole doses proportionately following discontinuation of treatment with CYP3A4 and/or CYP2D6 inhibitors.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Possible interactions between aripiprazole and haloperidol may involve pharmacodynamic (via D2 receptors), pharmacokinetic (CYP metabolism), and QTc-prolonging potential, as described below. Reduced initial aripiprazole doses and close monitoring are recommended.. <br><br>Aripiprazole, a partial dopamine (D2) agonist,<sup>1,2</sup> and haloperidol, a dopamine (D2) antagonist,<sup>3</sup> may exert overlapping or opposing pharmacologic effects. A published case report describes a 30 year old schizophrenic male who was hospitalized with poorly controlled psychotic symptoms while being treated with aripiprazole 10mg daily and haloperidol 5mg twice daily.<sup>4</sup> The aripiprazole dose was increased with a plan to taper haloperidol, however the patient became more paranoid and aggressive. The haloperidol dose was increased resulting in very little improvement and a lack of extrapyramidal symptoms. Aripiprazole was discontinued and the patient improved on the higher dose of haloperidol and was discharged home. The authors also noted that on 2 week follow up, psychotic symptoms were controlled, but EPS side effects had worsened. Prolactin serum concentration had increased to 54.2ng/mL compared to 19.7ng/mL at discharge two weeks earlier, indicating more complete dopamine blockade. Possible interference with haloperidol's dopamine antagonist effect by the dopamine partial agonist activity of aripiprazole was the hypothesized mechanism of this interaction. <br><br>Regarding the expected pharmacokinetic interaction between these agents, aripiprazole is a substrate of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4<sup>1,2,5,6,7,8,9,10</sup> which are both moderately inhibited by haloperidol.<sup>11,12,13</sup> Prescribing information for aripiprazole provides specific dose adjustment recommendations when combined with a CYP3A4 inhibitor or a CYP2D6 inhibitor.<sup>1,2</sup> Further dosage reduction is recommended when using a combination of a CYP3A4 inhibitor and a CYP2D6 inhibitor (or in an individual considered a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer). Adhering to these same dose recommendations when aripiprazole is used with a single agent that moderately inhibits both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, like haloperidol, would also be prudent.<br> <br>Finally, the concomitant use of aripiprazole and haloperidol is expected to increase the risk of significant QTc interval prolongation based on the effects of the individual agents on ventricular repolarization. Haloperidol can prolong the QTc interval, especially in higher doses and when administered intravenously.<sup>14</sup> Aripiprazole has much less potential for QTc interval prolongation, but prescribing information notes that QTc prolongation is associated with overdoses and recommends ECG monitoring with aripiprazole overdose.<sup>1</sup> ECG monitoring may be prudent if these two agents are used together.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Increase aripiprazole doses proportionately following discontinuation of treatment with CYP3A4 and/or CYP2D6 inhibitors.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Aripiprazole is a substrate of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.<sup>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8</sup> and ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of both enzymes.<sup>9,10,11</sup> Prescribing information for aripiprazole provides specific dose adjustment recommendations when combined with a CYP2D6 inhibitor or a CYP3A4 inhibitor.<sup>1,2</sup> Further dosage reduction is recommended when using a combination of a CYP2D6 inhibitor (or in an individual considered a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer) and a CYP3A4 inhibitor.<br><br>A 43 year old Hispanic male patient with HIV developed fever, cough, headache, neck stiffness, back pain, nausea, blurred vision and abdominal pain one month after a dose increase in his aripiprazole.<sup>12</sup> The patient was also receiving duloxetine for depression and anxiety and antiretroviral therapy (ART) that included darunavir and ritonavir. The patient improved and was discharged home to follow up with his primary care physician who subsequently attempted to taper the aripiprazole dose but the patient continued his previous dose of 50mg daily. The patient's symptoms returned and he was readmitted one month later. During admission the patient stated he had stopped taking his ART, but pharmacy refill history indicated adherence, including a refill three days prior to admission. On outpatient follow up approximately one month later, concern for a drug-drug interaction prompted the ordering of an aripiprazole serum concentration which came back at 1100ng/mL (therapeutic range 100-200ng/mL). A CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 mediated drug interaction between aripiprazole and protease inhibitors was the hypothesized mechanism of this interaction. Confounders in this case include uncertain adherence with ART, higher than recommended aripiprazole dosage, and co-treatment with duloxetine which is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor as well.<br><br>An additional concern regarding co-administration of aripiprazole and ritonavir is the potential additive effect on metabolic disturbances (hyperglycemia, weight gain, and hyperlipidemia).<sup>13</sup> Changes in metabolic paramaters are associated with antiretroviral therapy, and especially with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors like ritonavir.<sup>14</sup> Atypical antipsychotics are also associated with development of metabolic disturbances, but aripiprazole appears to have the lowest frequency compared to other agents in the class.<sup>15</sup> Monitor for development of metabolic disturbances in patients receiving aripiprazole and ritonavir.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Increase aripiprazole doses proportionately following discontinuation of treatment with CYP3A4 and/or CYP2D6 inhibitors.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Aripiprazole is indicated as augmentation therapy for depression and so could potentially be used in combination with serotonergic antidepressants.<sup>1,2,3</sup> Serotonin syndrome is a risk any time multiple agents with serotonergic activity are used concomitantly and several cases have been reported describing patients who develop symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome while receiving an antipsychotic agent together with a serotonin modulator (most involved serotonergic antidepressants).<sup>4,5,6,7,8,9,10</sup> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has also been reported with concomitant use of an antipsychotic agent with a serotonergic antidepressant.<sup>11,12,13,14,15</sup> Overlapping symptoms sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between serotonin syndrome and NMS as illustrated by a review of 17 cases of olanzapine-related NMS in which most of the cases possessed several characteristics of serotonin syndrome.<sup>16</sup> A case of NMS was reported in a 43 year old man who was receiving concomitant aripiprazole and fluoxetine. Not all features of NMS were present and the authors acknowledged that serotonin syndrome could not be ruled out. <br><br>The specific mechanism for this interaction is unclear, though one hypothesis for potential NMS-related symptoms focuses on the ability of serotonin to decrease dopamine release, exacerbating the dopamine blockade caused by many antipsychotics.<sup>17</sup> Further, many antipsychotics (particularly atypical agents) act as agonists or partial agonists at one or more serotonin receptors, possibly explaining the observed episodes of serotonin syndrome with concurrent use of other serotonin modulators. Aripiprazole is a partial serotonin (5HT-1A) agonist<sup>1</sup> which could contribute to development of serotonin syndrome or NMS. Conversely, aripiprazole is also a 5HT-2A antagonist which could possibly protect against the development of serotonin syndrome although clinical data supporting this are lacking.<sup>18</sup><br><br>Regarding the expected pharmacokinetic interaction between these agents, aripiprazole is a substrate of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4<sup>1,19,20,21,22,23,24,25</sup> and sertraline is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4.<sup>26,27,28,29</sup> Prescribing information for aripiprazole provides specific dose adjustment recommendations when combined with a CYP3A4 inhibitor or a CYP2D6 inhibitor.<sup>1,19</sup> Further dosage reduction is recommended when using a combination of a CYP3A4 inhibitor and a CYP2D6 inhibitor (or in an individual considered a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer). Although, when aripiprazole is being used as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder, prescribing information recommends it should be administered without dosage adjustment.<sup>1</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

In another study involving itraconazole oral capsules, double-strength grapefruit juice (240 mL) administered concurrently with itraconazole (200 mg) and 2 hours after itraconazole was associated with both a mean 43% decrease in itraconazole AUC and a mean 47% decrease in the AUC of hydroxy-itraconazole among 11 healthy volunteers.<sup>2</sup><br><br>In two separate studies (20 healthy volunteers each), single-strength grapefruit juice (240 mL) administered three times daily for 2 days prior to itraconazole oral solution (200 mg) and then together with and 2 hours after itraconazole was associated with a slight increase in itraconazole AUC.<sup>3,4</sup> In one study, the mean itraconazole AUC was increased approximately 20% with concurrent grapefruit juice,<sup>3</sup> and in the other study, the mean itraconazole AUC was only increased among female subjects (30% increase), who had an average 56% greater itraconazole apparent oral clearance compared to male subjects (with concurrent water), while there was no difference among male subjects.<sup>4</sup><br><br>The mechanism for this apparent interaction is unclear. For itraconazole oral capsules, whose systemic availability is decreased at higher gastric pH values, the reason for a decreased itraconazole AUC (or even the lack of an effect) with grapefruit juice (which is acidic and an inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A) is not known. Altered gastric motility and/or alterations in intestinal drug transporters (grapefruit juice is known to inhibit both various efflux and uptake transporters) are other possible explanations. For itraconazole oral solution, which is less sensitive to gastric pH, the slight increase in itraconazole availability appears to be due to grapefruit juice-mediated inhibition of CYP3A metabolism in the intestines, though a role for transporter inhibition is also possible.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

A study analyzing 24-hour urine samples from patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (n=127) collected before and during mitotane treatment also found that mitotane was associated with a 10-15 fold increase in the excretion of 6-beta-hydroxycortisol over cortisol, which may be indicative of a strong CYP3A4 induction potential by mitotane.<sup>3</sup> The potential interaction is also supported by earlier case reports in which mitotane therapy was associated with increased dose requirements for steroids and warfarin, which are at least partially dependent on CYP3A4 for their metabolism.<sup>4,5,6</sup><br><br>The mechanism of this interaction is by mitotane induction of metabolism of medications that are CYP3A4 substrates, causing decreased exposure to the substrate. An in vitro study confirmed that mitotane is capable of inducing CYP3A4, likely via activation of the steroid and xenobiotic receptor, leading to increased transcription of specific elements in the promoter of the <i>CYP3A4</i> gene.<sup>7</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
