Conversely, a large randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of alendronate efficacy in women (n=6459) with low hip bone mineral density evaluated alendronate toxicity as a secondary outcome measure, finding no evidence of an interaction between alendronate and nonsteroid antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs) or aspirin.<sup>2,3</sup> Though women with a history of major upper-gastrointestinal disease were excluded from the study, NSAID users were not, and approximatley 42% of patients in both the alendronate and placebo groups were using NSAIDs or aspirin at baseline. After a median of 3.8 years of follow-up the incidence of gastroduodenal and esophageal erosions/ulcerations were not significantly different between alendronate and placebo recipients, both among NSAID users and non-users. <br><br>The precise mechanism of this apparent interaction is unknown. NSAID-use is a known risk factor for gastrointestinal erosion/ulceration, and the bisphosphonate derivatives have been independently implicated in the formation of esophageal and gastroduodenal erosion/ulceration, though the association remains somewhat tenuous. Though selective COX-2 inhibitors may have less gastrointestinal toxicity than non-selective NSAIDs, there are no data regarding the gastrointestinal effects of COX-2 inhibitors combined with a bisphosphonate.<br><br>Bisphosphonate use has also been associated with nephrotoxicity, particularly when used at higher doses or as a bolus injection.<sup>4,5,6,7</sup> Though concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs has been identified as a possible risk factor for bisphosphonate nephrotoxicity, limited data specifically implicate concurrent NSAID and bisphosphonate therapy as a risk. A review of data from the French Adverse Event Reporting System identified 7 cases of zoledronic acid-associated renal toxicity; concurrent NSAID (ketoprofen) therapy was listed as a contributing agent for one of the cases.<sup>4</sup> Additionally, clodronate prescribing information cautions that concomitant use with NSAIDS and especially with diclofenac may increase the risk for nephrotoxicity, <sup>5</sup> though no specific data about the combination are provided. Both nonselective NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to have detrimental effects on renal function.<sup>8,9,10</sup> It might than be expected that the risks for nephrotoxicity may be increased when combining a bisphosphonate with non-selective and selective NSAIDs.<br><br>The mechanism for any pro-renal toxicity interaction between NSAIDs and bisphosphonates remains unclear. Mechanisms for bisphosphonate-induced renal dysfunction have been proposed,<sup>4,6,7</sup> but much regarding those mechanisms are unclear as well.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Dose adjustments of one or both agents may be necessary when used in combination.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> A 35-year-old man with a history significant for a partial tonic-clonic seizure disorder that had been well-controlled with phenytoin (400mg twice daily) and pregabalin (150mg twice daily) was started on efavirenz (800mg daily) and emtricitabine/tenofovir (200mg/300mg daily).<sup>1</sup> Three weeks previously, fluconazole (200mg daily) had been started for esophageal candidiasis, necessitating a 50% decrease in phenytoin dose (to 400mg once daily). Blood samples for efavirenz monitoring taken on days 5 and 15 of antiviral therapy both revealed efavirenz concentrations less than 0.5 mcg/mL. As a result, phenytoin was discontinued on day 20 and the efavirenz dose was increased to 600mg twice daily. Efavirenz concentration on day 34 had increased to 3.4 mcg/mL, and the efavirenz dose was reduced to 600mg once daily. Despite the initially low efavirenz concentrations, plasma viral load had decreased from 1,000,000 HIV RNA copies/mL before antiviral therapy to 12,400 copies/mL on day 14. With the higher efavirenz concentration on day 34, viral load fell further to 921 copies/mL.<br><br>Another case report describes a similar experience in which a 39-year-old man receiving phenytoin (300mg twice daily) had efavirenz concentrations of only 0.34 mcg/mL and 0.58 mcg/mL on days 9 and 21 of efavirenz (600mg daily) therapy.<sup>2</sup> After discontinuation of phenytoin and a temporary increase in efavirenz dose (to 800mg daily), the efavirenz concentration rose to 2.5 mcg/mL on day 49. Plasma viral load demonstrated an initial response (even with low efavirenz concentrations), decreasing from 1,816,200 HIV RNA copies/mL before antiviral therapy to 30,863 copies/mL on day 13. With the higher efavirenz concentration, viral load fell further to 189 copies/mL by day 56 of antiviral therapy.<br><br>The probable mechanism for the interactions reported in these cases is phenytoin-mediated induction of efavirenz metabolism.<sup>1,2,3</sup><br><br>Of note, efavirenz was suspected of increasing phenytoin concentrations in one of these cases, with phenytoin concentration increasing from 11.5-13 mg/L to 16.7-23.5 mg/L, despite no changes in phenytoin dose or other changes with concurrent therapy.<sup>2</sup> In vitro studies have shown that efavirenz is an inhibitor of the enzymes principally responsible for phenytoin metabolism (CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) at concentration ranges similar to those normally achieved during therapy.<sup>3,4</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Furthermore, as itraconazole and ketoconazole are substrates of 3A4, their combined use with etravirine, a known 3A4 inducer, would likely result in decreased plasma levels of the antifungal agents.

Liver enzyme elevations became evident a median of 24 weeks after pegvisomant initiation (range: 12-92 weeks). An alternative (non-drug) explanation was present in at least 2 of the cases (gall bladder obstruction), and pegvisomant was discontinued in only one case (attributed to drug-induced hepatitis and previously described in published case report<sup>2</sup>). The authors of this study also noted that concurrent diabetes was a significant risk factor for liver enzyme elevation (odds ratio = 5.1).<sup>1</sup><br><br>A published review of pegvisomant surveillance in Germany describes 12 patients with liver enzyme elevations (of more than 3 times the upper limit of normal) attributed to pegvisomant.<sup>3</sup> Four of these cases arose from the 35 patients enrolled in pegvisomant clinical trials (11.4%), 6 were from a group of 123 patients followed in a post-marketing surveillance study (4.9%), and 2 were reports received concerning patients not enrolled in any clinical study. Eleven (92%) of these patients had previously received octreotide, but only 2 patients were still receiving one of these agents at the time pegvisomant was started (remainder had discontinued octreotide between 7.6 and 177 weeks prior). The average onset of enzyme elevation was approximately 16 weeks after starting pegvisomant (range: 6.4-34.7 weeks), with the exception of one case where the onset was nearly 81 weeks after pegvisomant was initiated. Pegvisomant was withdrawn in 8 cases, and liver enzymes normalized in all of these patients. However, in the other 4 cases, liver enzymes also normalized despite continuation of pegvisomant, and re-exposure to pegvisomant in 2 other cases was performed without a reoccurrence of any enzyme elevations. Also of note, gallstone disease was noted in 50% of the cases (including one of the 2 patients on concurrent octreotide), offering either an alternative explanation or a possible mechanism to explain the possible drug-drug interaction.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
