Risk of cardiac toxicity may be greater with higher cyclophosphamide doses (more than 1.5g per m<sup>2</sup> per day). Patients should be adequately hydrated before and after the administration of pentostatin to facilitate its renal clearance and prevent acute renal insufficiency.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Two patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and no prior history of cardiovascular disease developed confusion, respiratory distress, hypotension, sinus tachycardia, and pulmonary edema within 24 hours after completing a myeloablative chemotherapy regimen consisting of 4 days of cyclophosphamide (total 6.4g per m<sup>2</sup> administered over 4 days), etoposide (total dose 1600mg per m<sup>2</sup>), and carmustine (total dose 450mg per m<sup>2</sup>), with a single dose of pentostatin (4 mg/m<sup>2</sup> ) administered on day 3 of the regimen.<sup>1</sup> Both patients died secondary to ventricular fibrillation within 2 hours of initial onset of symptoms. Evidence of infection was absent in both cases. A study in rats conducted by the authors of this case report offers support for the hypothesis that these clinical results were the result of an interaction between cyclophosphamide and pentostatin.<sup>1</sup> When given 1 hour after cyclophosphamide (400mg per kg), pentostatin (0.2mg per kg) administration was associated with a significant increase in mortality vs. cyclophosphamide alone at both 24h (93% vs. 38%, respectively) and 48h (100% vs. 52%, respectively). The identical dose of pentostatin was associated with 0% (0/15 rats) mortality at 24h, 48h, and 72h when given alone.<br><br>The role of each individual agent in the observed toxicity is unclear. Of the four chemotherapeutic agents involved, only cyclophosphamide has been frequently associated with cardiac toxicity, with a 25% incidence among patients receiving more than 1.5g per m<sup>2</sup> per day, and an incidence of less than 3% among individuals receiving lower doses.<sup>2</sup> Of note, both patients in the published case report were receiving cyclophosphamide doses greater than this 1.5g per m<sup>2</sup> per day level.<br><br>The mechanism by which the risk for cardiotoxicity increases when pentostatin is added to a high dose cyclophosphamide regimen is unknown. While possible mechanisms of cyclophosphamide cardiotoxicity have been described,<sup>2</sup> pentostatin itself is not thought to be particularly cardiotoxic, so the manner in which pentostatin would augment cyclophosphamide toxicity is unclear. A study in 11 adults with refractory lymphoproliferative disease found that pentostatin was associated with an increase in the level of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and a decrease in ATP levels within erythrocytes.<sup>3</sup> Systemic (non-lymphoid) toxicity was temporally related to the achievement of a dATP/ATP ratio exceeding 1.3 to 1.7.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Voriconazole may increase the serum concentration of Venlafaxine. <b>Severity</b> Moderate <b>Reliability Rating</b> Good </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Caution should be exercised when venlafaxine is used concomitantly with a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as voriconazole. Monitor patient closely for any signs/symptoms of toxicity especially with initiation of therapy/dose increases of voriconazole. Monitor for decreased effects of venlafaxine with a discontinuation/dose decrease of voriconazole.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> In an open-label crossover study of 12 healthy volunteers, pretreatment with voriconazole (400mg twice daily on day 1, 200mg twice daily on day 2) resulted in a non-statistically-significant increase (53%) in the AUC of venlafaxine (with a single 75mg dose).<sup>1</sup> The AUC of the active metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) was also non-significantly increased (14%). A significant increase (31%, p &lt;0.001) was observed in the AUC of the venlafaxine active moiety (venlafaxine + ODV). Despite evidence of only a small-moderate pharmacokinetic interaction, there was evidence of a more notable impact on venlafaxine effects. The area under the response-time curve (overall measure of venlafaxine effect) was increased by an average of 100% with voriconazole pretreatment. Additionally, both vomiting and visual disturbances were reported more often following voriconazole pretreatment versus control. Of note, these largely subjective measures of venlafaxine effect were altered more with voriconazole pretreatment (which was associated with only relatively minor pharmacokinetic changes) than with terbinafine (separate arm of the study), which yielded an approximate 5-fold greater exposure to venlafaxine. The mechanism and significance of these results remains to be determined. <br><br>Elevated levels of venlafaxine and ODV may be observed in patients receiving concomitant therapy with voriconazole. The mechanism behind this interaction most likely involves the inhibition of CYP3A4, 2C9, and 2C19 by voriconazole. Venlafaxine is metabolized to ODV by CYP2D6 and to the inactive metabolites, N-desmethylvenlafaxine and N,O-didesmethylvenlafaxine, via CYP3A4, 2C9, and 2C19.<sup>2,3</sup> Although not an inhibitor of CYP2D6, voriconazole inhibits CYP3A4, 2C9, and 2C19.<sup>4,5,6</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

In clinical trials, platelet counts of &lt;50,000 were observed in 61% of patients with baseline platelet counts equal to or greater than 150,000. The incidence of severe thrombocytopenia increased to 78% in individuals with mild thrombocytopenia at baseline. A minority of patients suffered hemorrhage (including fatal cerebral hemorrhage), and in &lt;5% of patients the duration of cytopenia exceeded the protocol treatment period of 12 weeks following the ibritumomab regimen administration.<br><br>More frequent monitoring and evaluation of hematologic status is recommended for individuals receiving antiplatelet therapy concurrently with ibritumomab therapy and for up to 3 months following completion of therapy with ibritumomab.
