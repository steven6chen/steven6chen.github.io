For patients also receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as telaprevir), U.S. product labeling recommends limiting tadalafil to a maximum of 2.5 mg/day (for once daily use) or 10 mg per 72 hours (for use as needed to treat ED). The Canadian product labeling recommends a tadalafil dose of 2.5-5 mg/day (for once daily use to treat ED), or 10 mg at minimum intervals of 48 hours and a maximum of 3 doses/week, with the option of increasing tadalafil to 20 mg if the lower dose is tolerated but ineffective (for use as needed). Canadian product labeling does not include BPH as an indication for tadalafil use. <br><br>If using tadalafil concurrently with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as telaprevir), monitor more closely for signs and symptoms of tadalafil toxicity (examples may include headache, dyspepsia, myalgia, flushing, priapism, and cardiovascular complications).</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Specific clinical data regarding use of this combination are not available, but data with ketoconazole, which is also a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, do support the existence of a significant interaction.

When sildenafil is used for treatment of erectile dysfunction, consider using a lower starting dose of 25 mg in patients also taking a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.
