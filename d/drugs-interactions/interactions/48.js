Separating the administration of these agents is unlikely to be an effective means of avoiding the interaction.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> According to data described in the leflunomide prescribing information, charcoal administration (powder made into a suspension, 50 g every 6 hrs x 24 hrs) was associated with a 37% reduction in the concentration of the primary leflunomide active metabolite, teriflunomide, at 24 hours, and a 48% reduction in teriflunomide concentrations at 48 hours.<sup>1</sup> It was also noted that charcoal and the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine both dramatically shortened the teriflunomide half-life, from 1-2 weeks to approximately 1 day.<sup>1</sup><br><br>In cases where enhanced leflunomide elimination is desired (e.g., suspected toxicity, patient desiring to become pregnant, etc.), this interaction can be utilized in order to facilitate more rapid leflunomide elimination. Several published reports describe successful outcomes of such an approach with the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine.<sup>2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11</sup> Similar reports specifically involving charcoal are lacking.<br><br>The specific mechanism for this interaction appears to be charcoal binding to teriflunomide (and/or other metabolites) excreted in the bile, preventing its reabsorption. Pharmacokinetic data show that nearly 50% of a leflunomide dose is excreted in the bile and that biliary recycling may account for the very long half-life of leflunomide.<sup>1</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Fluconazole may increase the serum concentration of Citalopram. <b>Severity</b> Major <b>Reliability Rating</b> Fair </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Citalopram prescribing information warns against the concomitant use of citalopram with other agents that prolong the QTc interval. Since fluconazole has been reported to cause QTc prolongation, the combination of citalopram and fluconazole should be avoided. If this combination cannot be avoided, consider a lower dose of citalopram and monitor closely for QTc prolongation and arrhythmias.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> The interaction between citalopram and fluconazole may involve both pharmacodynamic (QTc)<sup>1,2</sup> and pharmacokinetic (CYP2C19 inhibition)<sup>3</sup> mechanisms.<br><br>Citalopram has been reported to cause dose-dependent QTc prolongation, torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death.<sup>1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11</sup> As such, citalopram is generally classified as having a high risk for prolonging the QTc interval and causing proarrhythmic effects. Fluconazole is considered to be at least a moderate risk for QTc prolongation. A review of the FDA AERS database between 2004 and 2008, revealed 374 total reports of torsades de pointes associated with antimicrobial agents.<sup>2</sup> Fluconazole was the most commonly implicated antifungal agent with an adjusted reporting odds ratio of 14.23 (95% confidence interval, 10.54 to 19.43) signaling significant disproportionality. Since fluconazole has been reported to prolong the QTc interval, citalopram and fluconazole should not be used concomitantly.<br><br>Fluconazole may also inhibit the metabolism of citalopram. One report describes 2 patients who developed apparent serotonin toxicity associated with the combination of citalopram and fluconazole.<sup>11</sup> In one patient whose baseline medication regimen included fluconazole 200 mg/day, 2 weeks of worsening confusion occurred after initiation of citalopram (20 mg/day) therapy. After worsening of symptoms while a cause was being sought, the patient improved within 24 hours of citalopram cessation. In the other patient, whose medications included both citalopram 40 mg/day and fluconazole 100 mg/day, fever and progressing delirium were noted during a routine admission for chemotherapy. Signs and symptoms improved in this case approximately 72 hours after stopping citalopram. The authors of this report stated that the observed interaction is likely the result of inhibition of the CYP2C19-mediated citalopram metabolism (leading to greater citalopram concentrations and effects) by concurrent fluconazole, which is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Mean heart rate further decreased with the addition of dronedarone (change of -1.2 to -2.1 bpm vs. +3.0 bpm with placebo).<sup>1</sup> Also, dronedarone prescribing information cautions that use of this combination may be associated with an increased risk of bradycardia.<sup>2</sup><br><br>The mechanism of this probable pharmacokinetic interaction is inhibition of the CYP2D6-mediated metoprolol metabolism by dronedarone. Other beta-blockers that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism (e.g., timolol, nebivolol, carvedilol) would be expected to interact in at least a somewhat similar manner. The possible pharmacodynamic interaction between dronedarone and beta-blockers appears to result from the similar negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of these agents.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

The association with all three indicated that presence of the antibiotic was associated with a lower MPA trough concentration.<br><br>Average MPA exposure (0-48hr AUC) after a single mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1g dose was 14% lower following a 5-day course of norfloxacin (400mg twice daily) than at baseline in 11 healthy subjects.<sup>3</sup> Exposure to the MPA glucuronide metabolite (MPAG) was also lower after norfloxacin (mean 10% decrease in 0-48hr AUC). Following a 5-day course of norfloxacin (400mg twice daily) plus metronidazole (500mg three times daily), both MPA AUC(0-48) and MPAG AUC(0-48) were approximately 40% lower than at baseline. <br><br>It is suspected that antibiotics interact with mycophenolate by killing glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestinal tract, thus interfering with bacteria-mediated metabolism of MPAG. Glucuronidases produced by enteric bacteria act on MPAG to liberate active MPA, which is then available for re-absorption as part of the enterohepatic recirculation process that is suspected to contribute to up to 40% of MPA exposure.<sup>1,3</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

Follicle-stimulating hormone and leutenizing hormone concentrations increased substantially (by more than 3- and 4-fold, respectively) with use of ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel, and 7/22 (32%) women experienced intermenstrual bleeding during concurrent therapy. However, progestin concentrations remained below 5.1 nmol/L in all subjects, supporting the conclusion that ovulation remained suppressed in all women. The lamotrigine AUC was an average of 52% lower with concurrent therapy in this study, but that change is most likely attributed to the ethinyl estradiol component as other studies evaluating both combined contraceptive products and progestin-only products have reported significant changes with estrogen-containing products but no significant change with progestin-only products.<sup>2,3</sup><br><br>Note that many non-oral progestin-containing products (gels, vaginal rings, injectables, etc) introduce substantial circulating drug concentrations; therefore, caution with coadministration of interacting drugs is also warranted with these routes of administration.<br><br>The mechanism for a possible pharmacokinetic interaction between lamotrigine and levonorgestrel (or other progestins) is uncertain, though lamotrigine-mediated induction of levonorgestrel glucuronidation has been proposed as a possible mechanism.<sup>1</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
