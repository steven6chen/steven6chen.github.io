class=\"graphic_lgnd\">Strong evidence exists for a mucosal origin of type 3 inflammation in patients with AS. Paneth cells are an important source of IL-23, which acts on local innate and adaptive lymphocytes to stimulate an IL-17-IL-22 response. These cytokines are considered protective as they promote epithelium integrity. HLA-B27-influenced microbial dysbiosis might drive inflammatory events in the mucosa. IL-17-producing lymphocytes, probably of gut origin, are elevated in the blood of patients with AS. Gut-related trafficking markers, such as alpha-4-beta-7 and CCR9 have been implicated in the trafficking of type 3 immune cells into inflamed synovial tissue. Cells involved in type 3 immunity are enriched in different locations of synovial and cartilaginous joints of patients with AS, including synovial fluid, ligaments, and subchondral bone marrow. Mechanical stress might drive, in part, the activity of such cells at the enthesis. IL-17 is known to alter the activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, probably contributing to aberrant bone formation.</div><div class=\"graphic_footnotes\">AS: ankylosing spondylitis; APC: antigen-presenting cell; IL: interleukin; ILC3: group 3 innate lymphoid cell; Th17 cell: T helper 17 cell; NK cell: natural killer cell; KIR3DL2: immunoglobulin-like receptor 3DL2; IL7R: interleukin-7 receptor subunit alpha; MAIT cell: mucosal-associated invariant T cell; &alpha;4&beta;7: alpha-4-beta-7; CCR9: CC-chemokine receptor 9; HLA: human leukocyte antigen.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature Reviews Rheumatology.

Peptides that have an excessive number of amino acids at the N-terminal, which cannot be accommodated on class I MHC molecules, enter the ER and are further trimmed by ERAP1 and ERAP2. Peptides of appropriate length are loaded onto class I MHC molecules such as HLA-B27 to form a peptide-HLA-B27-beta-2-macroglobulin heterotrimer. This complex is then transported to the cell surface via the Golgi apparatus. Like other molecules destined to leave the ER, peptide-HLA-B27-beta-2-macroglobulin is transported through COPII vesicles. COPII vesicles are formed at a ribosome-free ER-exit site, and protein transport protein SEC16A regulates this process. Abnormal peptide complexes can form as a result of altered ERAP1 or ERAP2 activities, resulting in abnormal surface peptide-HLA-B27-beta-2-macroglobulin complexes. Unstable peptide-HLA-B27 complexes can accumulate in the ER, triggering the UPR, ERAD, and autophagy. Defects in COPII vesicle formation, ERAD, or autophagy could potentially amplify UPR responses. Furthermore, free heavy chains of misfolded HLA-B27 can combine to form dimers.</div><div class=\"graphic_footnotes\">AS: ankylosing spondylitis; HLA: human leukocyte antigen; COPII: coat protein complex II; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; TAP: transporter associated with antigen processing; ERAP: endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase; EDEM1: alpha-mannosidase-like protein 1; ERAD: endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation; MHC: major histocompatibility complex; UPR: unfolded protein response.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature Reviews Rheumatology.

The temperature threshold used to determine whether to treat a patient as uncomplicated cystitis versus complicated UTI is not well defined and should take into account baseline temperature, other potential contributors to an elevated temperature, and the risk of poor outcomes should empiric antimicrobial therapy be inappropriate.<br />¶ The possibility of prostatitis should also be considered in men.<br />Δ This includes a single antimicrobial dose given for prophylaxis prior to prostate procedures.<br /><FONT class=lozenge>◊</FONT> Appropriate oral agents to treat complicated UTI include levofloxacin (5 to 7 days), ciprofloxacin (for 5 to 7 days), and TMP-SMX (for 7 to 10 days). Beta-lactams (for 10 to 14 days) are appropriate if susceptibility is documented and other agents are not feasible.<br />§ Longer durations may be warranted in patients who have a nidus of infection that cannot be removed.<br />¥ Patients should be advised about the uncommon but potentially serious musculoskeletal and neurologic adverse effects associated with fluoroquinolones.<br />‡ Of the options listed, ceftriaxone is typically the preferred agent. Ertapenem is an alternative for patients with allergy or expected resistance to ceftriaxone, and aminoglycosides are reserved for patients who cannot use either.<br />† For outpatients who are more ill or are at risk for more severe illness, continuing the parenteral therapy pending culture results is also reasonable.</div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 116091 Version 3.0</div></div></div>"},"116093":{"type":"graphic_figure","displayName":"Major thermoregulatory defenses","title":"Major thermoregulatory defenses: Sweating, vasoconstriction, shivering","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div style=\"width: 720px\" class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">Major thermoregulatory defenses: Sweating, vasoconstriction, shivering</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><img style=\"width:700px; height:505px;\" src=\"images/ANEST/116093_Majorthermoregulatrydfnss.gif\" alt=\"Image\"/></div><div class=\"graphic_lgnd\">The major thermoregulatory defenses in humans. The threshold (triggering core temperature) for each response is shown on the Y-axis. Temperatures between the sweating and vasoconstriction thresholds define the interthreshold range, usually a few tenths of a °C, temperatures that do not activate thermoregulatory defenses and thus define normal core temperature (dashed oval). Sweating activates active pre-capillary vasodilation, which moves heat towards the skin surface for dissipation to the environment. The shivering threshold is 1°C below the vasoconstriction threshold; by the time humans begin to shiver, they are thus already fairly hypothermic.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Adapted from: Lopez M, Sessler DI, Walter K, et al.

Additional therapies are added as appropriate depending upon patient characteristics (eg, persistent heart failure symptoms).</div><div class=\"graphic_footnotes\">HFrEF: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤40&nbsp;percent); LVEF: left ventricular ejection fraction; SBP: systolic blood pressure; NYHA class: New York Heart Association functional class; eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate; VT: ventricular tachycardia; VF: ventricular fibrillation; ACE: angiotensin converting enzyme; ARB: angiotensin II receptor blocker; MRA: mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; LVEF: left ventricular ejection fraction; ICD: implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; CRT: cardiac resynchronization therapy.<br />* Management of acute decompensated heart failure is discussed separately. Acute decompensated heart failure encompasses heart failure syndromes requiring hospitalization including but not limited to presentation with acute pulmonary edema, acute coronary syndrome, hypotension (symptomatic hypotension or asymptomatic hypotension with SBP &lt;90 mmHg), and/or shock. For patients presenting with an initial episode of acute heart failure, long-term therapy (generally starting with addition of an oral ACE inhibitor or ARB to continued diuresis) is begun after initial stabilization, usually within 24 to 48 hours after presentation. Long-term therapy for every patient with HFrEF should include an ACE inhibitor (or ARB), a beta blocker, and generally also a diuretic, unless there are clear contraindications. A goal of therapy is to titrate ACE inhibitor (or ARB) and beta blocker to maximally tolerated doses while avoiding symptomatic hypotension or severe asymptomatic hypotension (SBP &lt;90 mmHg).<br />¶ Refer to UpToDate content on use of diuretics to treat heart failure.<br />Δ Goals of treatment of hypotension include avoidance of organ hypoperfusion and enabling initiation of ACE inhibitor (or ARB) therapy. Management of hypotension includes discontinuing any unnecessary vasodilators (eg, calcium channel blockers should generally be avoided in patients with HFrEF) and correcting intravascular volume depletion (eg, reducing or holding diuretic dose if there are no signs of congestion). If hypotension persists, cardiology consultation is recommended.<br /><FONT class=lozenge>◊</FONT> An ACE inhibitor should not be prescribed for patients with angioedema related to prior ACE inhibitor use or idiopathic or heritable angioedema. In patients who develop angioedema while taking an ACE inhibitor, there is a low risk of angioedema when an ARB is taken (which may be at least partly due to delayed response to the ACE inhibitor in the weeks and months after ACE inhibitor discontinuation). If ACE inhibitor intolerance is due to hyperkalemia, hypotension, or renal insufficiency, switching to combination hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (rather than an ARB) is suggested. Refer to UpToDate content on use of ACE inhibitor or ARB to treat HFrEF.<br />§ Beta blockers are initiated in hemodynamically stable patients with minimal or no volume overload. Beta blockers are commonly, but not always, initiated prior to ACE inhibitors. We suggest titrating ACE inhibitor to a moderate dose, then starting and titrating a beta blocker to target dose, then completing titration of ACE inhibitor to target dose. One key setting in which beta blockers are commonly initiated prior to ACE inhibitors is in patients with acute myocardial infarction, in whom beta blocker therapy is generally initiated within the first 24 hours and then continued, with ACE inhibitors commonly added subsequently. Refer to UpToDate content on pharmacologic treatment of HFrEF, treatment of acute decompensated heart failure in acute coronary syndromes, and use of beta blockers to treat HFrEF.<br />¥ For black patients with HFrEF, some experts recommend adding an MRA (if criteria for MRA therapy are met) before adding hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate.<br />‡ Refer to UpToDate content on use of hydralazine plus nitrates to treat HFrEF.<br />† Additional candidates for MRA are individuals post-ST elevation myocardial infarction with an LVEF ≤40% with either class II to IV heart failure or diabetes mellitus.

If doxycycline is not available, tetracycline (eg, 500 mg four times daily PO for adults) can be used for many nonpregnant patients. However, for nursing mothers and children &lt;8 years old, a macrolide, such as erythromycin or azithromycin, may be preferred if doxycycline cannot be used. Although the risk of dental staining is very low for children when a short course of doxycycline is administered, the risk of toxicity appears greater if other tetracyclines are used, and the choice of agent must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Available data suggest that doxycycline has not been associated with serious adverse events. However, the risk appears greater if other tetracyclines are used, and if doxycycline is not available, a macrolide may be preferred, particularly in those without evidence of CNS disease.

Refer to UpToDate topics on treatment of acute T cell-mediated rejection.<br />&para; Pulse glucocorticoids are given as IV methylprednisolone 300 to 500 mg daily for three to five days, followed by a rapid oral prednisone taper to the patient's previous maintenance dose of prednisone. If there are no concerns for nonadherence, the maintenance prednisone dose is augmented. As an example, if the maintenance prednisone dose at the time of rejection was 5 mg daily, the dose would be increased to 7.5 mg to 10 mg daily.<br />&Delta; All patients who are treated for acute antibody-mediated rejection should reinitiate antimicrobial and antiviral prophylaxis with a regimen that is identical to that administered in the immediate posttransplant period. This includes prophylaxis against <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia (PCP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease, and herpes simplex infection (in patients who are at low CMV risk) for three months. We also administer antifungal prophylaxis and a prophylactic histamine-2 (H2) blocker for prevention of peptic ulcer disease, although this practice may vary by center. Refer to&nbsp;UpToDate topics for specific regimen details.<br /><span class=\"lozenge\">&loz;</span> Plasmapheresis is performed every other day for a maximum of six sessions or until the serum creatinine is within 20 to 30% of the baseline. IVIG is administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg after each session of plasmapheresis. After the final session of plasmapheresis, IVIG at a dose of 500 mg/kg is given for one to two days. A total cumulative IVIG dose of at least 1000 mg/kg is given. In obese patients, some centers determine the IVIG dose based upon the patient's ideal body weight. Sucrose-free IVIG solutions that are no more than 5% concentrated are preferred to decrease the risk of acute kidney injury.<br />&sect; In patients with evidence of microvascular inflammation on biopsy, rituximab is administered as a single dose of 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> after completion of IVIG (and plasmapheresis, if performed).<br />&yen; Augmentation of immunosuppression depends upon the patient's regimen:&#xD;&#xA;<ul>&#xD;&#xA;    <li>In patients who are being administered triple immunosuppressive therapy, we switch to mycophenolate (if they are on azathioprine) or tacrolimus (if they are on cyclosporine).</li>&#xD;&#xA;    <li>In patients who develop acute rejection while on triple therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone, we continue these agents at higher doses if possible. We typically start by targeting higher levels of tacrolimus (ie, 20 to 25% higher than the level at the time of rejection).</li>&#xD;&#xA;    <li>In patients who are receiving dual therapy (calcineurin inhibitor and antimetabolite without prednisone) at the time of rejection, we initiate long-term prednisone at 5 mg once daily.</li>&#xD;&#xA;</ul>&#xD;&#xA;&Dagger; In patients who are &gt;1 year posttransplant, plasmapheresis is not performed due to the lack of evidence supporting its safety and efficacy in late-onset antibody-mediated rejection. IVIG is administered at a dose of 200 mg/kg every two weeks for three doses. In obese patients, some centers determine the IVIG dose based upon the patient's ideal body weight.

In all four panels, the length of the x-axis is the biventricular activation time reflected by the width of the QRS complex recorded on a surface electrocardiogram.<br />(A) With normal conduction, biventricular activation is rapid (ie, 90 ms) when impulses propagate antegrade over intact right and left bundles.<br />(B) In a patient with complete left bundle branch block, electrical activation is blocked antegrade due to the underlying disease state and proceeds more slowly following transseptal activation via the right bundle occurring via cell-to-cell connections. The total biventricular activation time of 170 ms is a typical intrinsic QRS duration for a patient with complete left bundle branch block.<br />(C) The grey thunderbolts depict left and right ventricular pacing stimulation resulting in electrical activation largely along myocardial cell-to-cell connections that are typically slower than intact His-Purkinje fibers. The total activation time of 140 ms is a typical paced QRS duration for a patient with biventricular pacing.<br />(D) The concept of fusion pacing is that intrinsic electrical activation proceeds antegrade over an intact right bundle and collides with electrical activation resultant from the left ventricular pacing stimulus depicted by the grey thunderbolt. The total activation time of 110 ms is afforded by rapid physiologic conduction over the native right bundle. The white thunderbolt depicts the optional delivery of right ventricular pacing stimulation that is delayed and offset from the left ventricular stimulus according to vendor-specific algorithms. As an example, such pacing stimulation could be applied in scenarios when the native His-Purkinje disease is more complicated than an isolated left bundle branch block.</div><div class=\"graphic_footnotes\">RV: right ventricular.</div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 116574 Version 1.0</div></div></div>"},"116578":{"type":"graphic_figure","displayName":"Caya contoured diaphragm","title":"Caya contoured diaphragm","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div style=\"width: 764px\" class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">Caya contoured diaphragm</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><img style=\"width:744px; height:680px;\" src=\"images/OBGYN/116578_Cayacontoureddiaphragm.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"/></div><div class=\"graphic_lgnd\">Silicone membrane: Covers the cervix to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus.<br />Center point: Palpable center point for better positioning of the diaphragm.<br />Grip dimples: To facilitate vaginal position.<br />Flexible rim: To ensure correct position.<br />Removal dome: For removal out of the vagina.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Caya&reg; contoured diaphragm.

In this case of Banff IIA rejection, the endothelialitis is mild (H&amp;E, 400x).<br />(E) In this example of Banff IIB acute T cell-mediated rejection, the endothelialitis is severe (dashed arrow, H&amp;E, 400x).</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Courtesy of Joseph P Gaut, MD, PhD.</div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 116699 Version 1.0</div></div></div>"},"116702":{"type":"graphic_table","displayName":"Clinical features of acute pharyngitis","title":"Clinical features of acute pharyngitis by pathogen","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">Clinical features of acute pharyngitis by pathogen</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><table cellspacing=\"0\"><colgroup width=\"10%\"></colgroup><colgroup span=\"2\" width=\"20%\"></colgroup><colgroup width=\"50%\"></colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"subtitle1\">&nbsp;</td> <td class=\"subtitle1\">Pathogen</td> <td class=\"subtitle1\">Relative frequency*</td> <td class=\"subtitle1\">Associated clinical syndrome and/or symptoms</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"divider_bottom\" rowspan=\"9\"><strong>Bacteria</strong></td> <td>Group A <em>Streptococcus</em></td> <td>Common</td> <td>Fever, tonsillar exudates, tender cervical lymphadenopathy, scarlatiniform rash, particularly in an adolescent or young adult</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Group C or G <em>Streptococcus</em></td> <td>Less common</td> <td>Similar to GAS pharyngitis but more frequently acquired in a waterborne or foodborne outbreak</td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Arcanobacterium haemolyticum</em></td> <td>Less common</td> <td>Similar to GAS pharyngitis, scarlatiniform rash common, particularly in adolescents and young adults</td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Fusobacterium necrophorum</em></td> <td>Uncertain</td> <td>Lemierre syndrome (septic jugular vein thrombophlebitis), possible association with recurrent or persistent pharyngitis</td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Corynebacterium diptheriae</em></td> <td>Rare</td> <td>Diphtheria: Low-grade fever, anorexia, malaise, sore throat with gray-white membrane on palate, tonsil or posterior oropharynx, cervical lymphadenopathy, particularly in a patient who has not been vaccinated</td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em></td> <td>Rare</td> <td>Cough, pneumonia</td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em></td> <td>Rare</td> <td>Fever, cough, laryngitis, pneumonia</td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Treponema pallidum</em></td> <td>Rare</td> <td>Secondary syphilis: Sore throat may precede development of mucosal ulcers, generalized lymphadenopathy and palmar-plantar rash</td> </tr> <tr class=\"divider_bottom\"> <td><em>Francisella tularemia</em></td> <td>Rare</td> <td>Ulceroglandular fever: Severe sore throat, pharyngeal exudes, cervical lymphadenopathy, oral ulcers; usually acquired by ingestion of contaminated water</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan=\"5\"><strong>Viruses</strong></td> <td>Respiratory viruses</td> <td>Very common</td> <td>Common cold: Fever, rhinorrhea, cough, hoarseness, coryza, conjunctivitis, oral ulcers</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Epstein-Barr virus</td> <td>Less common</td> <td>Infectious mononucleosis: Fever, fatigue, tender cervical lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, lymphocytosis, particularly in an adolescent or young adult</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Herpes simplex virus</td> <td>Less common</td> <td>Severe sore throat, with or without oral ulcers</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Cytomegalovirus</td> <td>Rare</td> <td>Mononucleosis-like syndrome, similar to EBV but typically milder</td> </tr> <tr> <td>HIV</td> <td>Rare</td> <td>Acute retroviral syndrome: Fever, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, rash, myalgias, arthralgias, diarrhea, weight loss, painful mucocutaneous ulcers</td> </tr> </tbody></table></div><div class=\"graphic_footnotes\">GAS: group A <em>Streptococcus</em>; EBV: Epstein-Barr virus; HIV: human immunodeficiency virus.<br />* The precise frequency of the etiologies of pharyngitis are not known.
