The eardrum is the thin layer of tissue between the ear canal and the middle ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55121\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55121 \">figure 1</a>). To put ear tubes in, doctors need to do surgery. Ear tubes are also sometimes called &quot;tympanostomy tubes&quot; or &quot;PE&quot; tubes (short for &quot;pressure equalization&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667279065\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might children get ear tubes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children might get ear tubes if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get a lot of ear infections &ndash; This includes children who get 3 or more ear infections in 6 months, or 4 or more infections in 1 year (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F54739\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54739 \">figure 2</a>). Ear tubes can help keep children from getting more ear infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have fluid in the middle ear that won't go away &ndash; Ear tubes let the fluid drain out of the middle ear (the part of the ear behind the eardrum) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67163\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67163 \">figure 3</a>). This is helpful because fluid in the middle ear can cause hearing loss. Long-term hearing loss can lead to language and speech problems in children, especially in young children.</p><p/><p>There are other benefits of ear tubes, too. They:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let air into the middle ear, which helps the middle ear heal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the pressure between the middle ear and the ear canal the same</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can keep a growth of cells (called a &quot;cholesteatoma&quot;) from collecting in and damaging the middle ear</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667279126\"><span class=\"h1\">What does ear tube surgery involve?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before the surgery, your child's doctor will give you instructions about what to do. Children should not eat or drink for a certain number of hours before surgery.</p><p>When the surgery starts, the doctor will give your child medicine to make him or her fall asleep. Then the doctor will make a small cut in the eardrum. He or she will place the ear tube in the eardrum.</p><p>Most children can go home a few hours after surgery. They can usually do their normal activities the next day.</p><p>After surgery, the doctor will see your child for a follow-up visit. The doctor will check that the tube is in the correct place and that fluid is draining well. He or she will also check your child's hearing. This might involve getting a hearing test.</p><p>Your child's doctor will also tell you if you need to keep water out of your child's ear. This is only needed in very few cases. If it is important for your child, the doctor might recommend that your child wear ear plugs when swimming or bathing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667279141\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen with ear tubes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following problems can happen with ear tubes. They can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep draining &ndash; Sometimes, fluid or pus keeps draining out of the tube.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get blocked</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Move out of place and fall into the middle ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fall out after only a short time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make a long-lasting hole in the eardrum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage the eardrum tissue</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667279156\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my child's doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgery, call your child's doctor or nurse if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets a fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has bloody drainage from the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has trouble hearing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has ear pain that doesn't get better or gets worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is dizzy or falls down a lot</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667279171\"><span class=\"h1\">How long do ear tubes stay in?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most ear tubes fall out on their own after 6 to 18 months. This is normal. If the ear tube doesn't fall out on its own after a few years, the doctor will probably do surgery to remove it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667279186\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I decide if my child should get ear tubes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This decision depends on your child and his or her individual situation. You should talk with your child's doctor about the benefits and downsides of ear tubes, and how much they can help your child.</p><p>The decision will probably depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How old your child is</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many ear infections he or she gets, or how long he or she has had fluid in the middle ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether your child has hearing loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether your child is talking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether your child has other ear conditions</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667279201\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ruptured-eardrum-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ruptured eardrum (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eustachian-tube-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Eustachian tube problems (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
