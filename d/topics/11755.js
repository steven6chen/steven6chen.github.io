Approximately 50 to 80 percent of women in their reproductive years can express one or more drops of fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], and 6.8 percent of women referred to a surgeon because of symptoms of a breast disorder have nipple discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most nipple discharge is of benign origin. </p><p>The primary goals of evaluation and management are to differentiate patients with benign nipple discharge from those who have an underlying papilloma, cancer, or high-risk lesion and to manage patients with underlying pathologic nipple discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Isolated papillomas are usually benign but can harbor areas of atypia or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ductal carcinoma in situ: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical history is most helpful in distinguishing benign from suspicious or pathologic nipple discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Benign nipple discharge is usually bilateral, multiductal, and occurs with breast manipulation. Conversely, the risk of cancer is higher when the discharge is spontaneous, bloody, unilateral, uniductal, associated with a breast mass, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occurs in a woman over 40 years of age.</p><p>The types of nipple discharge and how to evaluate and manage this common problem will be reviewed here. Surgical management of pathologic nipple discharge and ductoscopy are discussed in separate topics.

Each category is discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Lactation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal secretory products of the breast are milk and colostrum. During pregnancy and the postpartum period, the mammary glands develop and produce milk in response to a number of physical and biochemical forces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Milk secretion can continue for at least six months after delivery or after cessation of breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of lactation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bloody nipple discharge can be seen in 20 percent of women during the second or third trimester of pregnancy and lactation and is usually benign. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Bloody discharge'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic nipple discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physiologic nipple discharge or galactorrhea is defined as nonpathologic nipple discharge unrelated to pregnancy or breastfeeding. Galactorrhea is usually manifested as bilateral milky nipple discharge involving multiple ducts. The nipple discharge, although usually bilateral and white or clear, may also be unilateral and a variety of colors, including yellow (straw-colored), green, brown, or gray.</p><p>Galactorrhea is often caused by hyperprolactinemia, which may be secondary to medications, endocrine tumors (pituitary adenoma), endocrine abnormalities, or a variety of medical conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Medication-related causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic agents are a common cause of galactorrhea. The types of medications implicated include those that cause lactotroph stimulation or inhibit dopamine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75914\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75914 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurogenic stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurogenic stimulation represses the secretion of hypothalamic prolactin inhibitory factor, resulting in hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Examples of neurogenic stimulation include chronic breast stimulation from manipulation or clothing (for example, a poorly fitting brassiere).</p><p>Postthoracotomy syndrome is an unusual disorder in which the healing chest wound simulates the effect of a suckling infant. It can be associated with an elevated prolactin concentration, breast pain, and milk production. A similar effect can be seen with other forms of chest wall injury, including burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], cervical spine lesions, and herpes zoster. Often women will see a drop or two of discharge associated with a warm bath or shower. Discharge due to neurogenic stimulation generally resolves with resolution of the inciting factor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of stimuli can result in physiologic nipple discharge. In most cases, these stimuli cause hyperprolactinemia. In addition, any disease in or near the hypothalamus or pituitary that interferes with secretion of dopamine or its delivery to the hypothalamus can cause hyperprolactinemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stresses such as trauma, surgical procedures, and anesthesia may also inhibit dopamine release, thereby causing hyperprolactinemia and inducing galactorrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purulent nipple discharge can be seen in association with periductal mastitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonlactational-mastitis-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonlactational mastitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Periductal mastitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic (suspicious) nipple discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secretory production of fluids other than milk may be due to a pathological process in the breast. The discharge is usually unilateral and localized to a single duct, persistent, and spontaneous. It can be serous (clear or yellow), sanguineous (bloody), or serosanguineous (blood-tinged).</p><p>The most common cause of pathologic nipple discharge is a papilloma (52 to 57 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/6,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12-15</a>]. A papilloma is a papillary tumor growing from the lining of the breast duct. The discharge associated with a papilloma can be clear or grossly bloody. Solitary papillomas can occasionally harbor areas of atypia or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-breast-disease#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign breast disease&quot;, section on 'Atypical hyperplasia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ductal carcinoma in situ: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The standard recommendation for management of papillomas found on core biopsy is that they be excised whenever they are diagnosed by core needle biopsy, although there is emerging literature that supports nonsurgical management of papillomas without atypia with <span class=\"nowrap\">radiologic/pathologic</span> concordance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. In addition, a prospective trial that will hopefully definitively answer this question has been initiated by the Breast Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC 034) seeking to find the upgrade rate of adjacent invasive carcinoma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> DCIS for patients diagnosed with intraductal papilloma without atypia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The remaining cases are caused by ductal ectasia or other benign changes (14 to 32 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-breast-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign breast disease&quot;, section on 'Proliferative breast lesions without atypia'</a>.)</p><p>Malignancy is found in 5 to 15 percent of cases of pathologic nipple discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The most common malignancy associated with nipple discharge in the absence of other findings is DCIS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ductal carcinoma in situ: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Age is predictive of the risk of cancer in women with nipple discharge. In one series of women with isolated nipple discharge, malignancy was present in 3 percent of those &lt;40 years of age, 10 percent of those 40 to 60 years of age, and 32 percent of those over 60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough history and physical examination should be performed in all women with nonlactational nipple discharge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete medical history, including medication use, should be obtained. Specific areas to address are the appearance of the discharge, whether the discharge is spontaneous or provoked by manipulation of the breast, and whether it is unilateral or bilateral. Cancers generally present with spontaneous unilateral, uniductal, or bloody discharge. Bilateral nipple discharge is usually due to an endocrinologic or physiologic process, although bilateral synchronous cancers can occur. A history of recent trauma should also be elicited. Trauma can include mammographic imaging with compression as well as vigorous manipulation of the nipple by the patient or her partner.</p><p>Recent onset of amenorrhea or other symptoms of hypogonadism (hot flashes, vaginal dryness) should prompt consideration of hyperprolactinemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete breast examination should be performed. The four breast quadrants, subareolar areas, axillae, supraclavicular, and infraclavicular areas should be systematically examined with the woman both lying and sitting with her hands on her hips and then above her head. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass#H1657977\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of a palpable breast mass&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>The physical examination should include checking for a chiasmal syndrome (eg, bitemporal field loss) and signs of hypothyroidism or hypogonadism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-pituitary-adenomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gonadotroph and other clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The specific goals of the examination are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detect skin changes, noting the symmetry and contour of the breasts, position of the nipples, scars, and vascular pattern as well as any evidence of skin retraction, dimpling, edema or erythema, ulceration or crusting of the nipple, and changes in skin color.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elicit discharge from a nipple and identify the involved duct or ducts. Pressure in a clockwise fashion around the areola can help identify a specific site or duct that is producing the discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detect enlarged axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delineate and document breast masses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify localized areas of tenderness and relate them to areas of pain noted by the woman and to other physical findings.</p><p/><p>In particular, the skin covering the breast and nipple areolar complex should be examined for lesions that may be staining the woman's clothes and mimicking nipple discharge. Some examples are Paget disease, insect bites, local infections, and eczema.</p><p>A warm compress placed on the breasts will enhance the chances of detecting mammary secretion. Gentle, firm pressure should be applied at the base of the areola (not on the nipple), at the site where the newborn's mouth is normally applied. Massage from the periphery towards the nipple areolar complex may also help.</p><p>It is important to observe whether the discharge comes from one or more ducts on the nipple; flow from one duct is more worrisome than that from multiple ducts. A good light and magnifying lens can help with this identification.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Bilateral discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral discharge should be evaluated for gross blood.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloody nipple discharge, an abnormal mammogram or breast ultrasound, or the presence of a breast mass on physical examination requires evaluation by a surgeon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of a palpable breast mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral multiductal secretion that is nonbloody is usually normal regardless of color (eg, milky, brown, green, yellow, blue, gray, or clear). Medical evaluation and endocrine workup may be required, but surgical intervention is usually not indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Unilateral discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uniductal unilateral discharge is more likely to represent underlying pathology, such as papilloma or intraductal breast carcinoma. This is true even if the discharge is not bloody. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast, multiductal discharge, even if unilateral, is less likely to represent significant breast disease and should be investigated similarly to bilateral discharge. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Bilateral discharge'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The color of nipple discharge can provide an indicator of the risk of underlying malignancy. A meta-analysis of eight studies including 3110 patients showed that patients with bloody nipple discharge had a higher risk of breast cancer (52 percent) than patients with nonbloody nipple discharge (19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Straw-colored or clear transparent discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Straw-colored (yellow) or clear (serous) nipple discharge is typically due to a papilloma but may be associated with a malignancy. The muscular arteries that run through the peduncle of an intraductal papilloma supply adequate blood flow to the neoplasm, but the lymphatics and veins are compromised in the narrow peduncle. The resulting increase in vascular pressure causes a transudate to form in the duct. This discharge is typically a straw-colored, transparent, sticky fluid. It is very much like plasma, since that is the source of the secretion. Unilateral spontaneous serous discharge is considered suspicious and requires a full workup. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic (suspicious) nipple discharge'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Bloody discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Grossly bloody or sanguineous nipple discharge simply means that a lesion in the duct is bleeding. The bleeding can be caused by an intraductal carcinoma (in-situ or invasive), a bleeding papilloma, or benign fibrocystic changes with an active intraductal component (eg, plasma cell mastitis, ductal ectasia, intraductal hyperplasia, or papillomatosis). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic (suspicious) nipple discharge'</a> above.)</p><p>Bloody nipple discharge can also be seen in approximately 20 percent of women during pregnancy and lactation. The cause is usually hypervascularity of developing breast tissue, which is benign and requires no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. However, the evaluation of breast complaints in pregnancy and lactation can be complicated by the changing breast examination. Referral for surgical evaluation and biopsy is warranted for evaluation and management of bloody nipple discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bloody nipple secretion can also be caused by intraductal pathologies (eg, papilloma, papillomatosis, and hyperplasia) or plasma cell mastitis with duct ectasia, which is a chronic inflammatory condition, and occasionally breast carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic (suspicious) nipple discharge'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Staining of the bra without obvious nipple discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A woman may report finding a stain or spot of blood on her brassiere or underclothing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This merits careful examination of the skin around the nipple and nipple-areolar complex. While skin changes such as dermatitis or eczema and associated excoriations can occur, it is important to rule out Paget disease with a skin biopsy if the lesions persist after conservative treatment. Paget disease is a breast cancer, characterized clinically by an eczematoid appearance with nipple crusting, scaling, or erosion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paget-disease-of-the-breast\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paget disease of the breast&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the skin is intact and no discharge can be elicited and the rest of the physical examination and radiologic evaluation is negative, then short-term clinical follow-up is appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast imaging and laboratory testing should be tailored to the patient's presentation. In general, after clinical evaluation and physical examination, all women presenting with pathologic nipple discharge should undergo a focused ultrasound. A mammogram should be performed for women &ge;30 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Additional imaging modalities are discussed in detail below.</p><p>Surgical evaluation is indicated if there is a breast mass; any imaging abnormality; or the discharge is spontaneous, uniductal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bloody. Surgical evaluation of pathologic nipple discharge is required for diagnosis and treatment even if imaging results are negative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of a palpable breast mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If physical examination is otherwise normal, imaging is negative, and the discharge is multiductal and nonbloody, then the patient will need laboratory tests, medical evaluation, and galactorrhea workup.

These tests are not indicated for evaluation of uniductal discharge. Further endocrinological evaluation is also indicated if there are other systemic abnormalities, such as menstrual irregularity, infertility, headaches, visual disturbances, or symptoms of hypothyroidism.

Although the sensitivity of mammography is low, it is the best modality for identifying suspicious lesions in the breast. Ultrasound is especially useful for identifying lesions within the ducts that can be subjected to core biopsy or localized for surgical biopsy. In addition, ductography is often used to delineate an intraductal filling defect that may be causing the nipple discharge.</p><p>Cytology is rarely helpful and is not recommended. Other diagnostic testing, including breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR ductography, ductal lavage, and ductoscopy can be helpful in selected women but are not always necessary for the workup of nipple discharge. Each of these diagnostic tools is discussed below.</p><p>Imaging does not reliably identify all cancers or high-risk lesions, such as papilloma or atypia.

If core biopsy is performed, a clip should be placed to allow subsequent localization if surgery is required. </p><p>In a series of 52 patients with suspected ductal disease, ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 97 percent and a specificity of 60 percent with a positive predictive value of 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

The intraductal lesion will appear as an intraductal filling defect, a complete ductal obstruction, or a wall irregularity. Ductography can only be performed if the nipple discharge is reproducible on physical examination and if the duct can be cannulated. In a series of 306 patients with suspicious nipple discharge and negative standard evaluation (breast exam, mammogram, and ultrasound), 163 underwent ductography. Successful cannulation was achieved in 88 percent. Ductography was associated with a sensitivity of 76 percent and specificity of 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The positive predictive value of ductography in this series was 19 percent.</p><p>The absence of a lesion on ductogram does not exclude a cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36</a>]. However, if ductography is successful, it may help identify the location of the lesion, which can aid the surgeon in more precisely localizing the proper area at the time of surgery, thereby limiting the amount of tissue excised.</p><p>Ductography should not be performed in patients with mastitis or a breast abscess, as this could worsen the inflammation. Ductography can cause mastitis if too much contrast material is injected or if too much pressure is used during injection, resulting in perforation of the duct and extravasation of contrast material.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a relatively sensitive imaging modality with moderate specificity. The role of MRI in the evaluation of nipple discharge is evolving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In 52 patients with suspicious nipple discharge who were studied with a breast MRI, the sensitivity and specificity for malignancy were 77 and 62 percent, respectively, with a median follow-up of 14 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The positive predictive value of MRI in this series was 56 percent. The significant false positive rate and somewhat limited availability of MR-guided biopsy limits the utility of this modality. If MR is going to be used in this setting, it should be done in a facility that has MR biopsy capabilities. A meta-analysis comparing MRI versus ductography for pathologic nipple discharge found a higher diagnostic accuracy for MRI in cancer detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies#H633667\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;MRI of the breast and emerging technologies&quot;, section on 'Indications for breast MRI'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of women with suspected breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Breast MRI'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">MR ductography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MR ductography is a different technique than standard breast MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. It utilizes heavy T2 weighting, which accentuates the visibility of fluid-containing structures. No directly instilled or intravenous contrast material is necessary. MR ductography provides a three-dimensional image and can show the precise shape and location of the abnormal duct and lesion in the breast. However, this technique will not reveal ducts that are not dilated or those with low signal intensity on heavily T2-weighted images due to hemorrhage or the presence of proteinaceous contents within the duct.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No definite benefits have been identified for the routine use of cytology in the evaluation of nipple discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Systematic cytologic examination of all nipple discharge is not cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study of 618 patients with nipple discharge over a 14-year period, the sensitivity and specificity of cytology were 17 and 66 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this series, only one malignant lesion was diagnosed with cytology alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Ductoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ductoscopy can be employed as a minimally invasive method for evaluation and treatment of nipple discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. It was first introduced in 1988, and the size and resolution of the scopes has improved significantly over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. As with ductography, ductoscopy requires a reproducible discharge and the ability to cannulate and dilate the discharging duct. Mammary ductoscopy is discussed in a separate topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ductoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ductoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Ductal lavage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ductal lavage is a means to increase the scant cellularity of specimens obtained by expression or aspiration of nipple discharge for cytology. The procedure involves cannulation of each fluid-yielding duct with a single-lumen catheter; saline is instilled through the catheter and then removed. The effluent is immediately fixed and centrifuged to recover a cell pellet. The effectiveness of this technique has been questioned because the cancer-filled duct may not always yield fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Even if cells are obtained on lavage, this does not help localize the lesion. Furthermore, this is an extension of cytologic evaluation of the breast and suffers from the same limitations. In general, cytology of the discharge or of a ductal lavage specimen does not impact management. That is, a benign result is not a substitute for pathologic evaluation, and a positive result does not provide a reliable diagnosis, especially in cases where atypia is reported. Additionally, the technique is time intensive, is expensive, and requires expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin punch biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women sometimes present with a complaint of nipple discharge but are found to have skin lesions on the nipple rather than true nipple discharge. These lesions can have the appearance of dermatitis or eczema with erythematous lesions that weep or bleed. These can be the first signs of Paget disease of the breast, an unusual breast cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paget-disease-of-the-breast\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paget disease of the breast&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although a short-term course of treatment with steroid cream can be considered, if the lesions do not resolve within two weeks or recur after treatment, such skin lesions should be subjected to a punch biopsy for definitive diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical treatment for physiologic nipple discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient is taking a medication that has been associated with galactorrhea (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>, phenothiazines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) and the breast evaluation is otherwise negative, the patient should be educated that this is a side effect of the medication. In some cases, continuing the medication is appropriate (as an example, antipsychotic drugs). If the symptom of ongoing nipple discharge is bothersome to the patient, the medication can be tapered or changed in consultation with the prescribing clinician. Treatment of hyperprolactinemia is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical treatment for pathologic nipple discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a full evaluation has ruled out malignancy, pathologic nipple discharge in nonlactating women should be managed by a terminal duct excision with or without image guidance. If a core needle biopsy has demonstrated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer, appropriate cancer surgery should be planned. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;, section on 'Patient selection for BCT'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the regional lymph nodes in breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a core biopsy was not possible or nondiagnostic, a terminal duct excision is necessary to treat the nipple discharge and confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A terminal duct excision is usually approached through a circumareolar incision and removes tissue at least 2 to 3 cm distal from the nipple. When a single duct can be implicated, the surgeon should direct the resection to the site of concern, attempting to preserve the unaffected duct such that lactation may still be possible.</p><p>An intraductal papilloma can be resected over a lacrimal duct probe gently placed in the duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Alternatively, a nipple flap duct resection can be performed. In this procedure, the areolar skin is dissected back with a gentle teasing dissection to the subareolar region where the abnormal duct can be identified as larger and darker than the other lactiferous ducts. The ductal abnormality can be confirmed by gentle occlusion of the duct with a hemostat, which will demonstrate that the nipple secretion no longer flows. The duct is then resected by ligation of its cutaneous end followed by dissection and excision of the length of duct that appears abnormal and its intraluminal lesion.</p><p>Another approach is to perform preoperative ductography with instillation of a mixture of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> and radiopaque dye, which can provide a visual image of the course of the duct as well as aid in intraoperative identification of the targeted duct, which will be filled with blue dye. This can help limit the dissection to the area of the intraductal lesion and increase the likelihood of identifying a lesion at pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-discharge/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Central (total) terminal duct excision is occasionally used for intractable discharge from multiple ducts that is causing significant distress to the patient. A period of observation with no nipple stimulation is recommended prior to proceeding to surgical therapy. It is important to discuss with premenopausal women that this will preclude lactation in the future. Some women can still breastfeed after a localized excision of a single duct; however, the scarring associated with healing can still make this difficult or impossible, and women should be counseled as to this possibility. Terminal duct excision can also change the sensitivity of the nipple, including hyposensitivity and hypersensitivity.</p><p>Surgical techniques of excising a pathologic mammary duct is further discussed in another topic.

Most nipple discharge is benign in origin. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of nipple discharge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign physiologic unilateral or bilateral nipple discharge (galactorrhea) is characterized by multiductal discharge that is nonbloody, regardless of color (eg, milky, brown, green, blue, gray, or clear). Galactorrhea is caused by hyperprolactinemia and may be secondary to medications, endocrine tumors (pituitary adenoma), endocrine abnormalities, or a variety of medical conditions. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic nipple discharge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic discharge is characterized by spontaneous, persistent, unilateral discharge limited to one duct (uniductal). The discharge can be either serous (straw-colored or clear), sanguineous (bloody), or serosanguineous (blood-tinged). An intraductal papilloma is the cause of pathologic discharge in over one-half of the cases, while underlying malignancy is the cause of nipple discharge in 5 to 10 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic (suspicious) nipple discharge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The workup of suspicious nipple discharge should include ultrasound and mammography. The role of imaging is to determine whether there are any underlying lesions that may account for the symptom of nipple discharge and to target the area for surgical localization. However, imaging studies do not reliably identify cancer or high-risk lesions in patients with nipple discharge. Other diagnostic testing, including ductography, breast magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance ductography, and ductoscopy can be helpful in selected women but are not routinely necessary for the workup of nipple discharge. Cytology and ductal lavage are rarely helpful. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical evaluation of pathologic nipple discharge with major duct excision is required for diagnosis and treatment even if the imaging results are negative.
