The term &quot;diabetic cardiomyopathy&quot; was initially introduced based upon postmortem findings in four diabetic adults who had HF in the absence of coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Diabetic cardiomyopathy has been defined as ventricular dysfunction that occurs in diabetic patients independent of a recognized cause (eg, coronary heart disease, hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, the frequency with which this occurs is not well defined and there is some evidence that diabetic cardiomyopathy is uncommon in patients with type 1 diabetes in the era of intensive insulin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Issues related to HF in diabetic patients will be reviewed here. The prevalence of and risk factors for coronary heart disease among patients with DM and the evaluation and treatment of HF are discussed separately.

The risk of HF was increased 2.4-fold in men and fivefold in women. Diabetes predicted HF independent of coexisting hypertension or coronary disease. When patients with prior coronary or rheumatic heart disease were excluded, the relative risk of HF remained elevated at 3.8 in diabetic men and 5.5 in diabetic women.</p><p>Similar findings have since been noted in a number of other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. As an example, in a report of 9591 subjects with type 2 diabetes and matched controls, HF was more frequent at baseline in diabetics (11.8 versus 4.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among those free of HF at baseline, HF developed more often in diabetics during a 30-month follow-up (7.7 versus 3.4 percent).</p><p>The frequency of HF in diabetic patients is even higher among elderly adults.

These include fibrosis, infiltration of the interstitium with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive material, and alterations in the myocardial capillary basement membrane, including the formation of microaneurysms.</p><p>Myocardial fibrosis, advanced glycation end product deposition, and cardiomyocyte resting tension were compared in diabetic and nondiabetic HF patients without coronary disease with normal LVEF (28 patients, 16 diabetic) or reduced LVEF (36 patients, 10 diabetic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Diminished insulin activity limits glucose availability, resulting in a shift toward fatty acid metabolism.

Neurohumoral activation in HF causes increased free fatty acid metabolism, which may cause systemic and myocardial insulin resistance.

Compared with nondiabetics, diabetic patients were significantly more likely to be admitted for HF (risk ratio 1.6) and had higher rates at one year of all-cause mortality (32 versus 22 percent), cardiovascular mortality (28 versus 19 percent), and mortality related to pump failure (11 versus 6 percent).</p><p>The increase in all-cause mortality associated with diabetes in SOLVD was limited to patients with an ischemic cardiomyopathy (adjusted relative risk 1.37 compared with 0.98 in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In the presence of coronary disease, diabetes was independent of other risk factors for predicting worsening of HF and it was third in order of importance, after age and left ventricular ejection fraction. Previous surgical revascularization may identify diabetic patients with HF who have improved survival (91 versus 86 percent without revascularization).

In meta-analyses of randomized trials of thiazolidinediones for the treatment or prevention of type 2 diabetes, the estimated relative risk of HF in patients randomly assigned to TZDs compared with placebo ranged from 1.7 to 2.1 (95% CIs 1.2-2.4 and 1.1-4.1, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. The incidence of HF was not limited to the elderly and occurred at high and low doses after a median treatment duration of 24 weeks.</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a later randomized trial (RECORD) that evaluated the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> or sulfonylurea therapy compared with combination metformin and sulfonylurea therapy; there was a 2.1-fold (95% CI 1.35-3.27) increased risk of HF resulting in hospitalization or death with the addition of rosiglitazone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. There was no difference in the primary end point of cardiovascular hospitalization or cardiovascular death.</p><p>One mechanism by which TZDs increase HF risk is renal sodium retention. Peripheral edema occurs in 4 to 6 percent of patients treated with TZDs (compared with 1 to 2 percent with placebo) and in a higher percentage of patients with a history of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In both randomized and observational studies, TZD use has been associated with worsening HF and pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/65-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-68</a>]. Weight gain and fluid retention are more common with concomitant insulin therapy. Fluid retention induced by TZDs appears to be relatively resistant to loop diuretics but responds promptly to withdrawal of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/66,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,69</a>].</p><p>The fluid retention with TZDs appears to result at least in part from PPAR-gamma stimulation of sodium reabsorption by sodium channels (called the epithelial sodium channel) in the luminal membrane of the collecting tubule cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. This effect is mediated by increased expression of the epithelial sodium channel gene mRNA.</p><p>Sodium retention by aldosterone is also mediated by this channel. However, aldosterone excess is not associated with edema, due to the phenomenon of aldosterone escape in which sodium reabsorption is reduced at other sites in the nephron to minimize fluid retention. Escape does not appear to occur with the thiazolidinediones, perhaps due to a concurrent fall in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/69,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,71</a>], in contrast to the increase in blood pressure in primary aldosteronism. </p><p>To the degree that increased activity of the collecting tubule sodium channel is involved, blockade of this channel may be effective. Administration of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>, is part of the standard medical regimen of many patients with HF and in a study of diabetic patients without HF who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a>, spironolactone produced more fluid removal than a loop diuretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiloride</a>, which blocks this channel, may also be effective.
