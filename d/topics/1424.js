The integration of improvements in neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], computed tomography [CT], newer techniques) provides valuable information, but significant issues remain.</p><p>Developments in response criteria for both high-grade and low-grade gliomas are reviewed here. The management of these tumors is discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, initial surgical approach, and prognosis of high-grade gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-postoperative-therapy-for-glioblastoma-and-anaplastic-astrocytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial postoperative therapy for glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy for high-grade gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-grade-glioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low-grade glioma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576579521\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-grade (grade III or IV) gliomas are best managed with a combined modality approach, incorporating adjuvant postoperative radiation therapy (RT) and adjuvant chemotherapy following initial surgery. Despite aggressive therapy, most patients eventually develop progressive or recurrent disease, and require multiple courses of treatment to provide optimal care.</p><p>For patients on clinical trials, the gold standard is prolongation of overall survival in randomized trials, and this approach has been used with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy.</p><p>Assessment of overall survival in randomized trials is subject to limitations. Crossover from one treatment to another or the use of subsequent therapy can obscure the benefit derived from one treatment in the original randomization. In addition, overall survival cannot be used as a decision-making tool for individual patients.</p><p>An alternative to address some of these issues has been the use of progression-free survival (PFS), either as a median duration or by use of a landmark such as PFS at six months. The use of PFS, both in clinical trials and for individual patients, requires an accurate and consistent definition of progression. Without such a definition, there is a risk that efficacious therapy will be discontinued prematurely or that an ineffective treatment will be continued without benefit. Effective criteria are also important in the conduct of clinical trials for the development of new agents in patients with malignant brain tumors.</p><p>The Macdonald criteria for the assessment of response and progression were originally promulgated in 1990 and have been the standard approach for patients with high-grade glial tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, these criteria are subject to a number of significant limitations. Thus new criteria have been proposed by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group to address these issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Both of these approaches are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Macdonald criteria</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Definitions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Macdonald criteria rely upon changes in two-dimensional tumor area, as defined by contrast enhancement on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These criteria defined four outcomes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete response &ndash; Complete disappearance of all tumor on consecutive CT or MRI scans at least one month apart, off steroids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial response &ndash; Greater than or equal to a 50 percent decrease in area of enhancing tumor on consecutive imaging studies at least one month apart. Doses of steroids must be stable or decreased and the patient must be neurologically stable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive disease &ndash; Greater than or equal to a 25 percent increase in size of enhancing tumor or any new tumor on CT or MRI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stable disease &ndash; All other situations.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing experience and improvements in tumor imaging with MRI and the availability of new antiangiogenic agents have helped to highlight a number of important limitations associated with the Macdonald criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudoprogression: The standard approach to treatment of high-grade gliomas includes surgery, followed by radiation therapy and concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy. Approximately one-fourth of patients have evidence of pseudoprogression, which is manifested by increased contrast enhancement at the first reimaging and which then resolves despite continued therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-postoperative-therapy-for-glioblastoma-and-anaplastic-astrocytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial postoperative therapy for glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy for high-grade gliomas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of recurrent high-grade gliomas&quot;, section on 'Early progression versus pseudoprogression'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical changes: Surgical changes can result in increased enhancement in the wall of the surgical cavity in the first 48 to 72 hours after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Such areas of contrast enhancement must be distinguished from residual tumor that was not resected. A baseline MRI obtained within 24 to 48 hours after surgery can avoid confusing such enhancement with residual contrast-enhancing tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiangiogenic therapy: Antiangiogenic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> can normalize tumor vasculature, which can result in decreased contrast enhancement within one to two days of initial treatment. The disparity between observed a very high response rate with these agents based upon resolution of contrast enhancement and a limited effect on overall survival suggest that these changes may not correlate with actual tumor regression. This improvement in contrast enhancement due to diminished vascular permeability does not necessarily reflect a true antitumor effect and has been referred to as a &quot;pseudoresponse&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, a subset of patients who progress on antiangiogenic therapy have nonenhancing tumor that is not taken into account by the Macdonald criteria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of recurrent high-grade gliomas&quot;, section on 'Bevacizumab'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other issues that are not adequately addressed by the Macdonald criteria include irregularly shaped tumors, multiple tumors, and enhancing lesions in cyst walls following surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">RANO criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group is an international, multidisciplinary group that is developing criteria that can address the limitations that are present in the Macdonald criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Key features of the proposed RANO criteria that differ from the Macdonald criteria include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the first twelve weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, progressive disease requires contrast enhancement outside the radiation therapy field or histologic evidence of viable tumor on a biopsy sample in order to avoid confusing progressive disease with pseudoprogression. Clinical deterioration alone is not adequate to define progression during this initial period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the first 12 weeks, criteria for progressive disease include new contrast enhancement outside the radiation field or an increase in size of the original lesion. For patients receiving an antiangiogenic agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, the diagnosis of progressive disease can also be based upon an increase in size of a nonenhancing lesion, as visualized using T2 weighted or fluid attenuation inversion recover (FLAIR) magnetic resonance image (MRI) sequences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitions for complete response, partial response, and stable disease are similar to those for the Macdonald criteria. However, these now incorporate the results obtained from T2 or FLAIR images for nonenhancing lesions.</p><p/><p>The RANO criteria have been formulated for incorporation into clinical trials, and further validation of these guidelines is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. However, the issues raised by these criteria, particularly concerns about pseudoprogression and the evidence for progressive disease in situations not meeting the Macdonald criteria, are also applicable to clinical practice. Accurate assessment of nonenhancing tumor burden and tumor progression is perhaps the most difficult aspect of the RANO criteria for high-grade gliomas, and these is ongoing debate as to whether it provides added value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. RANO criteria for patients treated with immunotherapies have also been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576579620\"><span class=\"h1\">LOW-GRADE GLIOMAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of response and progression in patients with low-grade gliomas is more difficult than for high-grade gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Key issues include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slow growth rate of these tumors until they undergo malignant transformation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of contrast enhancement in the majority of cases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor correlation between tumor imaging findings and clinical parameters of cognition and health related quality of life</p><p/><p>Overall survival is limited as a tool in assessing treatment efficacy clinical trials because of the prolonged median survival (five years or more) and because of the confounding effects due to salvage therapies.</p><p>Progression-free survival has often been used in assessing the efficacy of investigational agents. However, assessment of progression can be subjective and is particularly difficult because of the difficulties in accurately imaging low-grade gliomas. Progression-free survival has not been validated as an end point, and its correlation with overall survival is uncertain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576579640\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the vast majority of cases, low-grade gliomas do not exhibit contrast enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, the Macdonald criteria that are used in patients with high-grade gliomas usually cannot be applied. The diagnosis and subsequent assessment of low-grade gliomas is based upon T2 or fluid attenuation inversion recover (FLAIR) magnetic resonance image sequences for nonenhancing lesions, which are relatively poor in assessing small changes. Newer approaches, such as functional imaging (PET), may eventually be more effective as predictors of tumor control and patient survival than tumor size measurement by MRI or CT, but currently these remain experimental.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576580157\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a relatively poor correlation between imaging findings and clinical relevant endpoints. These include cognitive function, symptom burden, seizure activity, and the need for corticosteroids, all of which contribute significantly to the overall health-related quality of life. Each of these parameters needs to be considered prospectively assessed both in the clinical trial setting and in the management of an individual patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576579664\"><span class=\"h2\">RANO criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group has proposed specific criteria for patients with low-grade gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete response &ndash; Complete disappearance of the original lesion on T2 or FLAIR magnetic resonance image sequences and the absence of any new lesions or imaging abnormalities other than those attributable to treatment.

Alternatively, progression is defined based upon clinical criteria that include definite clinical deterioration that is not due to other causes or to decreasing doses of corticosteroids.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2732727314\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROLOGIC ASSESSMENT (NANO) SCALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic response assessment must be integrated with neurologic function to best determine overall disease status. The Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale has been proposed as a quantifiable evaluation of nine neurologic domains assessed during a routine clinical visit and examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The following guidelines are consistent with those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for follow-up imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with high-grade gliomas, a repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be obtained four weeks after completion of radiation therapy, then every two to four months for two to three years, and less frequently thereafter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with low-grade gliomas, a repeat MRI should be obtained every three to six months for five years, and then at least annually thereafter.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a high-grade glioma, the assessment of disease status depends upon multiple factors, including the characteristics of the tumor on imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], computed tomography [CT]), overall clinical status, and use of steroids.

Limitations of the Macdonald criteria include overestimation of progressive disease in patients with pseudoprogression, a failure to recognize the importance of non-contrast-enhancing disease as detected by <span class=\"nowrap\">T2/fluid</span> attenuation inversion recover (FLAIR) sequences, and the impact of antiangiogenic therapy in reducing the vascular abnormalities associated with high-grade gliomas.
