Survival rates are improving, but over half a million people die from cancer each year in the United States alone. Cancer outranks cardiovascular disease as the number one cause of death in the United States for those under the age of 85 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Both screening and prevention can reduce mortality from cancer. Screening detects abnormalities before they are clinically apparent, allowing for intervention either before cancer develops or at an early stage, when treatment is most often effective. Prevention strategies focus on modifying environmental and lifestyle risk factors that promote cancer. It is estimated that 50 percent of cancer is preventable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Multiple cancer risk factors have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].Tobacco use, excess weight, poor diet, and inactivity account for two-thirds of all cancers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In one study, nine modifiable risks were identified as the cause of 35 percent of cancer deaths worldwide: smoking, alcohol use, diet low in fruit and vegetables, excess weight, inactivity, unsafe sex, urban air pollution, use of solid fuels, and contaminated injections in health care settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has identified and tabulated over 100 human carcinogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Lifestyle factors have been linked to a variety of malignancies, including the most common in the developed world: lung, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a longitudinal study, participants who had all four lifestyle factors (never smoking, body mass index [BMI] &lt;30, physical activity &gt;3.5 hours weekly, prudent diet) had approximately one-third the risk of cancer compared with those who had none of these factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A comprehensive systematic review with a global focus conducted by the World Cancer Research Fund came to similar conclusions regarding dietary, weight, and activity factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A study of an index, based on recommendations from the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute of Cancer Research related to weight management, physical activity, plant and animal food consumption, breastfeeding in women, and alcohol intake, found a significant association of higher scores (better compliance) with risk reduction for total cancer and multiple specific cancers (colorectal, stomach, breast, endometrium, lung, kidney, liver, esophagus) but not for prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, or bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Approximately one-half of all smokers die of a tobacco-related disease, and adult smokers lose an average of 13 years of life due to this addiction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

Smoking is also implicated as a causative factor for leukemia as well as cancers of the oral cavity, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, larynx, esophagus, pancreas, liver, stomach, cervix, kidney, large bowel, and bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Studies also suggest that smoking is associated with increased incidence of prostate cancer, particularly in African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The relationship of smoking and breast cancer risk is controversial. (See relevant topic reviews on the risk factors for all of these cancers.)</p><p>Tobacco acts on multiple stages of carcinogenesis: it delivers carcinogens directly to tissues, causes irritation and inflammation, and interferes with the body's natural protective barriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The dangers of tobacco are most commonly associated with cigarette smoking but also occur with cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco, and exposure to environmental (secondhand) tobacco smoke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Significant health benefits accompany quitting, even for longtime tobacco users. Smoking cessation leads to reduced risk of most tobacco-related diseases and a decrease in all-cause mortality.

Radiation from the sun is the primary cause of both melanomatous and non-melanomatous skin cancer. Ultraviolet radiation causes genetic mutations and interferes with the cutaneous immune system, limiting the body's ability to reject abnormal cells. Risk of squamous cell and basal cell cancer appear to correlate with total lifetime sun exposure. Cumulative sun exposure may also increase melanoma risk, but repeated intense exposures leading to blistering burns may be even more dangerous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Ultraviolet exposure from tanning beds has been classified as a human carcinogen, with a 75 percent increase in risk for melanoma in patients who utilized tanning booths before age 35 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The largest body of evidence related to associations with colorectal cancer, with 7 of 14 cohort studies and 7 of 15 case control studies finding positive associations for red meat and colorectal cancer, and 12 of 18 cohort studies and 6 of 9 case-control studies finding an association for processed meat and colorectal cancer. A meta-analysis found a dose-response relationship based on 10 cohort studies, with risk increased by 17 percent (CI 1.05-1.31) per 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of red meat and increased by 18 percent (95% CI 1.1-1.28) per 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of processed meat.

Data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, a cohort study of nearly 500,000 European men and women followed for nine years, found only a weak association between increased intake of fruits and vegetables and overall risk of cancer (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Many epidemiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>], though not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], suggest a weak association between the intake of a diet high in fruits and vegetables and protection from colorectal cancer. A pooled analysis of 14 cohort studies (n &gt;750,000), including the previous study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], concluded that eating more than 800 g fruit and vegetables daily, compared with less than 200 g, decreased risk for distal colon cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.74) but not for proximal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. A subsequent meta-analysis of 19 cohort studies concluded a weaker protective effect, with most of the risk reduction attributable identified at a far lower threshold (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> of fruit and vegetable intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Inaccuracy of retrospective diet reports in the case-control studies may affect their reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. However, a subsequent cohort study found no increase in risk of ovarian cancer with dietary dairy or lactose intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Thus, the relationship of dairy intake to ovarian cancer is uncertain.</p><p>Several studies suggest that intake of low-fat dairy products may protect against breast cancer, mainly in premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/94-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-97</a>]. In the largest prospective cohort study of over 88,000 women in the Nurses' Health Study, there was an inverse association between breast cancer risk and the intake of low-fat dairy products, calcium (mainly dairy intake), and vitamin D (mainly non-dairy intake) in premenopausal but not postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

Results have been variable among large epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses, and the degree of protection from dietary fiber, if any, will remain unsettled until prospective intervention studies are done. In the absence of randomized trials, observational data may be confounded by the relationship of fiber intake with other micronutrients and with other choices related to lifestyle and diet.

As an example, a large European study involving 519,978 patients found that intake of dietary fiber was inversely related to colon cancer incidence (adjusted RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41-0.85), comparing the highest to lowest quintiles of fiber intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. However, the results may have been confounded by lack of control for folate intake, and fiber may have served as a proxy for this micronutrient. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Folate and other B vitamins'</a> below.)</p><p>Several large cohort studies from the United States have not shown an association between the development of colorectal adenomas or cancer risk and either fiber intake in general or cereal fiber in particular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/105-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">105-108</a>]. A pooled analysis of 13 prospective cohort studies (725,628 men and women followed up to 20 years) found the inverse association of fiber with the risk of colorectal cancer was no longer apparent after accounting for other dietary risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Likewise, a meta-analysis of five studies concluded that fiber did not affect the incidence or recurrence of adenomatous polyps (the precursor to colorectal adenocarcinomas) within a two- to four-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].

In a population-based cohort study of over one million people in Norway, warfarin users (for at least six months) had a lower incidence of all cancer diagnosed at least two years after initiating warfarin (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.84; 95% CI, 0.82-0.86) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/257\" class=\"abstract_t\">257</a>].

Basic lifestyle changes can have a tremendous impact on the rates of cancer. The fact that such changes also protect against other chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes) makes the case for prevention even more compelling.</p><p>General lifestyle recommendations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid tobacco</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be physically active</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain a healthy weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and low in <span class=\"nowrap\">saturated/trans</span> fat, red meat, and processed meat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit alcohol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protect against sexually transmitted infections. Vaccinate girls and boys against HPV.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid excess sun</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get regular screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer</p><p/><p>Specific factors associated with cancer risk include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tobacco use is responsible for 90 percent of all lung cancer deaths and is tied to multiple other cancers. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Tobacco use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity has been found to increase the risk of many types of cancers, with an estimated 4.5 million deaths worldwide annually caused by excess weight. (See <a href=\"#H349227125\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The association of dietary fat, fruits, vegetables, and fiber with cancer risk is largely unconfirmed. Red meat consumption may promote colorectal cancer and a high intake of tomatoes probably decreases prostate cancer risk. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diet'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High calcium intake (&gt;2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> increases risk for prostate cancer. Folate in diet has been associated with a decreased risk of colon and breast cancer, especially in women who drink alcohol; data on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> or multivitamin supplementation are inconsistent. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Vitamins and micronutrients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol intake, even in moderate quantities, increases the risk for colon, breast, esophageal, and oropharyngeal cancer. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical activity is inversely related to risk for colon and breast cancer. Excess weight increases the risk of multiple cancers. (See <a href=\"#H349227082\" class=\"local\">'Physical activity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H349227125\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin cancer is directly related to natural and artificial UV exposure, and melanoma rates are increasing. A history of blistering sunburns and indoor tanning, especially in youth and young adults, is of particular risk for melanoma; cumulative sun exposure has more impact on non-melanoma cancers. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Excess sun exposure, artificial ultraviolet radiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV), Hepatitis C (HCV), human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV1), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B (HBV), Epstein&ndash;Barr virus (EBV), and <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> have been linked to human cancers. Exposure prevention, screening, vaccination for HPV and hepatitis B, and early treatment for abnormal cervical findings and HIV infection can prevent cancer. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemoprevention may be helpful in high-risk patients, but risks and benefits should be weighed carefully. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) offer protection against adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer, and long-term use in low doses likely decreases cancer-related mortality risk from other solid tumors. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Chemoprevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamoxifen</a> decreases incidence of breast cancer in high-risk women but increases the risk for thromboembolic disease and early-stage endometrial cancer. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Raloxifene</a> is an alternative but has not been evaluated in premenopausal women. Aromatase inhibitors also decrease the risk of breast cancer but may cause muscle and joint pain and are not recommended for premenopausal women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-aromatase-inhibitors-for-breast-cancer-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer prevention&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Torre LA, Bray F, Siegel RL, et al.
