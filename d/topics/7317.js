It probably progresses through a series of preinvasive lesions (metaplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma in situ), followed by microinvasive carcinoma and then fully invasive carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Fluorescence bronchoscopy was developed to identify preinvasive lesions. The hope is that identification and treatment of such lesions may improve the outcome from squamous cell carcinoma of the bronchus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Technical aspects of fluorescence bronchoscopy and its clinical role are reviewed here. Lung cancer screening, evaluation, and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial evaluation, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGICAL RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been known since the early part of the last century that tissues fluoresce when exposed to light of a suitable wavelength and that the fluorescence is altered by infiltrating tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. It was hypothesized that such differences in fluorescence might help detect tumors in the airways, but initial attempts were unsuccessful because either the intensity of fluorescence was too low to be detected with the naked eye or the fluorescence was obscured by light reflected from the bronchoscope's excitation beam. Photosensitizing fluorescent compounds (eg, hematoporphyrin derivatives) were used to increase the intensity of the fluorescence, but this approach was limited by skin photosensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. As a result of these limitations, interest in fluorescence bronchoscopy diminished.</p><p>Technological advances in image acquisition and processing have improved the detection of subtle differences in fluorescence without the use of a fluorophore. This has renewed interest in fluorescence bronchoscopy. Dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and microinvasive carcinoma exhibit much weaker green fluorescence and slightly weaker red fluorescence than normal tissues, when illuminated by light with a wavelength of 380 to 440 nm (blue spectrum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The reasons for the differences in fluorescence are not well understood, but may be due to increased epithelial thickness, increased blood flow, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a reduced concentration of fluorophores in abnormal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Advances in fluorescence bronchoscopy have been matched by improvements in conventional white light bronchoscopy. Developments in optics and image processing (eg, high-definition video, optical coherence tomography, narrow band imaging, high magnification bronchoscopy) have improved optical resolution and characterization of the bronchial mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Tissue microstructure, epithelial thickness, vessel density, and microvascular network changes can now be determined, allowing minimally invasive assessment of bronchial epithelial lesions. These advances, combined with fluorescence imaging, have the potential to improve the detection and characterization of bronchial preinvasive lesions and early carcinomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INSTRUMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most fluorescence bronchoscopy systems use autofluorescence, rather than induced fluorescence. Autofluorescence refers to the fluorescence of tissues when exposed to light of a suitable wavelength. In contrast, induced fluorescence refers to tissue fluorescence that is induced by a photosensitizing compound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">LIFE devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first autofluorescence bronchoscopy system that was commercially available was the Light-Induced Fluorescence Endoscopy (LIFE) device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. This device illuminated the bronchial tree with blue light from a helium-cadmium laser and collected autofluorescence images via its imaging bundles. The red and green wavelengths of the autofluorescence image were filtered and amplified by image-intensifying cameras. Their relative intensities were measured and this information was used to display a computer-enhanced image delineating abnormal areas of fluorescence.</p><p>The LIFE device has been superseded by the Onco-LIFE device (also known as Pinpoint) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This device uses a filtered blue light source to generate green autofluorescence images and a red light source to obtain red reflectance images. The images are analyzed and assigned contrasting colors, which are displayed as a single real-time image on a video monitor. The green autofluorescence is normalized by the red reflectance, which enhances the contrast between normal and abnormal tissue. This reduces the rate of false positive results. Abnormal tissue appears brown-red on a green background (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54332\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54332 \">table 1</a>). The relative differences in intensity between the blue light-induced green autofluorescence and the red light-induced red reflectance can be displayed numerically, providing some quantification of the fluorescence changes.</p><p>Autofluorescence and white light bronchoscopy are typically performed during the same session. The LIFE device required separate light sources for each, but the Onco-LIFE device can switch between autofluorescence and white light bronchoscopy using the same device and light source.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Karl Storz device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Karl Storz devices makes an autofluorescence bronchoscopy system that utilizes a conventional xenon light source and an optical filter that can be fitted to the eyepiece of a standard bronchoscope, or used through a dedicated autofluorescence bronchoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The bronchoscope with dual white light and autofluorescence modes allows easy switching between modes without withdrawing the bronchoscope from the patient. In conventional white light mode standard bronchoscopy can be performed. In autofluorescence mode or with a dedicated autofluorescence bronchoscope, the light source illuminates the bronchial tree with two bands of blue light. The optical filter transmits the red and green wavelengths reflected by the tissue, as well as some of the excitation wavelength. This facilitates visualization in areas of low fluorescence. Abnormal tissue is typically visualized on video camera as brown-purple on a blue-grey background (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54332\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54332 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other devices that are available for fluorescence bronchoscopy are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54332\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54332 \">table 1</a>). They include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The SAFE-1000 device has been superseded by SAFE-3000, a device that uses a xenon blue light source and a single camera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Autofluorescence images are generated by digital processing and can be viewed either simultaneously with white light images (ie, side by side) or superimposed on white light images. Abnormal tissue appears red-purple on a blue-green background.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I-scan is a device that is intended to supersede autofluorescence. A high-definition camera built into the bronchoscope is used to obtain images of a very high quality. The image undergoes post-processing and filtering to generate a real-time image. There are three modes. In i-scan1 contrast enhancement is used to accentuate the edges of lesions and vessel patterns within the bronchial mucosa. I-scan2 uses tone enhancement to improve the definition of vessel patterns and further highlight the margins of lesions. In i-scan3 a color mode enhances the vascular pattern in a manner similar to narrow-band imaging. Although there are no major studies of this technology, there is the potential for improved identification of pre-invasive lesions and invasive carcinomas within the airways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The DAFE system uses a filtered 300W Xenon lamp and filters to obtain the autofluorescence images with color recalibration within the individual to optimize the image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The system can be connected to a standard bronchoscope using a camera mount or used with a dedicated autofluorescence bronchoscope. Abnormal tissue appears purple on a blue-grey background and blood or areas of high vessel density appear black. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Olympus LUCERA system uses a Xenon lamp with a rotating filter wheel to filter blue and green light as the excitation beam. Autofluorescence generated by the blue light is filtered, detected by the CCD camera, and displayed on the blue channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Reflectance from the green light is filtered, detected by the CCD camera, and displayed on the red and blue channels of the monitor. Abnormal tissue appears magenta on a green background.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVIDENCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most clinical studies that evaluated the diagnostic characteristics of autofluorescence bronchoscopy used the LIFE autofluorescence bronchoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/13,14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,20</a>]. However, the Karl Storz device has been used with similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Instruments'</a> above.)</p><p>Most studies performed conventional white light bronchoscopy first, followed by autofluorescence bronchoscopy during the same session. Biopsies were taken from areas that appeared abnormal during either type of bronchoscopy. Control biopsies were taken from areas that appeared bronchoscopically normal. The ability of each bronchoscopic modality to distinguish abnormal epithelium (ie, dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, microinvasive carcinoma, or invasive carcinoma) from normal epithelium was determined by histological examination of the biopsy specimens.</p><p>Studies performed in this way have been subjected to the following criticisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observations during white light bronchoscopy may have biased the subsequent autofluorescence bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. This was evaluated in a trial that failed to confirm the bias. The trial randomly assigned 55 patients with suspected lung cancer to undergo either white light followed by autofluorescence bronchoscopy, or autofluorescence followed by white light bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The sequence of the procedures did not affect the results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimates of the sensitivity of autofluorescence bronchoscopy may have been exaggerated in studies that calculated sensitivity from the number of biopsies that revealed abnormal histology, rather than the number of discrete lesions detected, since more than one biopsy may have been taken from a lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimates of the sensitivity of autofluorescence may have been imprecise because the number of preinvasive lesions within the visible bronchial tree cannot be accurately determined by control biopsies. In a study that addressed this possibility, autofluorescence bronchoscopy was performed prior to lobectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The bronchial tree was dissected from the lobectomy specimen and the number of preinvasive lesions was determined. Autofluorescence bronchoscopy detected approximately 50 percent of the preinvasive lesions. This suggests that the true sensitivity is lower than that estimated by studies that used control biopsies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is general agreement that autofluorescence bronchoscopy, combined with conventional white light bronchoscopy, improves the detection of airway preinvasive lesions compared to conventional white light bronchoscopy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In other words, combined white light and autofluorescence bronchoscopy is more sensitive than white light bronchoscopy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/13-24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-24,27</a>].</p><p>The degree to which combined white light and autofluorescence bronchoscopy is more sensitive than conventional white light bronchoscopy alone appears to vary according to the histological grade of the preinvasive lesion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High grade preinvasive lesions (moderate to severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ) are detected 1.2 to 6.3 times (mean 2.7 times) more often with combined white light and autofluorescence bronchoscopy than with conventional white light bronchoscopy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>]. This equates to a sensitivity of 86 percent for combined white light and autofluorescence bronchoscopy and a sensitivity of 46 percent for conventional white light bronchoscopy alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low grade preinvasive lesions (squamous metaplasia, mild dysplasia) are detected with similar sensitivity by conventional white light bronchoscopy alone and combined white light and autofluorescence bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When high grade preinvasive lesions and invasive carcinoma are considered together, the sensitivity improves 1.2 to 3.7 times (mean 1.9 times) with combined white light and autofluorescence bronchoscopy, compared to conventional white light bronchoscopy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>]. This equates to a sensitivity of 85 percent for combined white light and autofluorescence bronchoscopy and a sensitivity of 58 percent for conventional white light bronchoscopy alone. This relative difference is smaller than that described above for high grade preinvasive lesions because conventional white light bronchoscopy is better at detecting invasive carcinomas than preinvasive lesions.</p><p/><p>Although autofluorescence bronchoscopy is effective at distinguishing abnormal from normal airway epithelium, it is incapable of predicting the histologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Positive predictive value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined white light and autofluorescence bronchoscopy is better at detecting airway lesions than conventional white light bronchoscopy alone, but it is also more likely to give false positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a study that determined the proportion of biopsies from areas of abnormal autofluorescence that contained abnormal histology, the positive predictive value was only 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A limitation of predictive values is that they are highly influenced by the prevalence of the disorder in the population studied. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-diagnostic-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating diagnostic tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is possible that some lesions, considered false positive results on the basis of histology, actually represent abnormal epithelium that is so early in its development that it still appears histologically normal. Supporting this possibility, a study found that 50 percent of the lesions that exhibited abnormal autofluorescence, but normal histology, had molecular abnormalities that were similar to preinvasive lesions and invasive carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence that the poor prognosis of lung cancer is partially attributable to the advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inoperable stage at which most patients present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>]. The goal of autofluorescence bronchoscopy is to improve clinical outcomes by detecting lung cancers at an early stage, when surgery provides the best chance of cure.</p><p>The impact of autofluorescence bronchoscopy on clinical outcomes (eg, mortality) is unknown because it has not been well studied.

The goal is to identify the culprit lesion, which may be difficult with conventional white light bronchoscopy alone because abnormalities are often subtle and can occur over a wide area of the tracheobronchial tree (especially among individuals who have smoked heavily or have already had an invasive lung cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>The ability of autofluorescence bronchoscopy to detect the culprit lesion was illustrated by a study of 92 smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In the subgroup of patients who had abnormal sputum cytology and normal radiographic imaging, combined white light and autofluorescence bronchoscopy detected lung cancer 2.8 times more often than conventional white light bronchoscopy alone (11.1 versus 4 percent).</p><p>Autofluorescence bronchoscopy may also identify individuals who are at increased risk of developing carcinoma. In a study of 46 patients with sputum atypia or previous history of aerodigestive carcinoma, the number of areas within the bronchial tree that had abnormal autofluorescence was directly related to the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma over the next four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High grade preinvasive lesions (ie, moderate to severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ) are sometimes treated endoscopically or surgically by clinicians who believe that such lesions are at significant risk of malignant change (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68140\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68140 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50329\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50329 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>].

Combined white light bronchoscopy and autofluorescence bronchoscopy is the preferred bronchoscopic modality, if available. This approach is supported by clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The strategy of following patients who have high grade preinvasive lesions bronchoscopically , rather than treating them endoscopically or surgically, is based upon two concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presumption that all high grade preinvasive lesions will inevitably develop into malignancy may be incorrect.

In addition, a review of the literature found that only one out of three high grade preinvasive lesions progressed to invasive carcinoma, which was equal to the rate of regression to normal epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluorescence-bronchoscopy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of treating dysplasia and carcinoma in situ is uncertain.

The purpose is to determine the extent of the abnormality and to look for other lesions.</p><p>Findings during autofluorescence bronchoscopy may affect which therapy is selected and how it will be performed.
