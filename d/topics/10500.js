Maternal alloimmunization occurred as a result of a previous pregnancy with an Rh(D)-positive partner or from some other source of Rh(D)-positive red cells (eg, incompatible blood transfusion, needle sharing). An Rh(D)-negative fetus is not at risk for hemolytic disease, and further evaluation, monitoring, and intervention are unnecessary, unless maternal alloimmunization involving non-Rh(D) red cell antibodies has occurred. Obviously, certainty as to paternity is imperative, and nonpaternity is more common than one might assume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Zygosity testing will reveal a heterozygous paternal genotype in approximately 40 percent of Rh(D)-positive Caucasians. Heterozygotes have a 50 percent chance of having Rh(D)-negative offspring, so cfDNA testing is performed to determine fetal Rh(D) type.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133180553\"><span class=\"h3\">Cell free DNA testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive assessment of fetal <em>RHD</em> using cfDNA is widely available in the United Kingdom and Europe. It is also available in the United States, but may not be covered by insurance.</p><p>The fetal <em>RHD</em> genotype is determined by testing a sample of maternal plasma after 10 weeks of gestation. If the fetus is <em>RHD</em>-negative and the mother has no additional red cell antibodies, it is not at risk for hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and further maternal or fetal monitoring for HDFN is unnecessary. If the fetus is <em>RHD</em>-positive, then maternal indirect Coombs titers (ie, indirect antiglobulin test) are obtained serially until a critical titer is reached. (See <a href=\"#H63000749\" class=\"local\">'Follow maternal anti-D titers in at risk fetuses until the critical titer is reached'</a> below.)</p><p>Fetal cfDNA can be detected in the maternal circulation as early as 38 days of gestation. It comprises 10 to 15 percent of the total cfDNA in the maternal circulation during the late first and early second trimesters, increases with advancing gestation, and disappears soon after delivery. Fetal <em>RHD</em> status is determined by evaluation of cfDNA sequences in maternal plasma using a reverse transcriptase PCR. A 2016 meta-analysis of studies of cfDNA for <em>RHD</em> determination reported sensitivity of 99.3 percent (95% CI 98.2-99.7) and specificity of 98.4 percent (95% CI 96.4-99.3) in the first and second trimesters; real-time quantitative PCR sensitivity was higher than conventional PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Assays for the <em>RHD</em> exon 4; exons 5 and 7; exons 4, 5, and 7; or exons 4, 5, 7, and 10 have been recommended, and should be done after approximately 10 weeks of gestation so there will be adequate fetal cfDNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/3,5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-9</a>]. Detection of these <em>RHD</em> exons in maternal plasma indicates fetal cfDNA is present and the fetus is <em>RHD</em>-positive. If <em>RHD</em> exons are absent, the fetus is <em>RHD</em>-negative as long as it can be proven that fetal cfDNA and not maternal cfDNA was tested (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F86944\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86944 \">algorithm 2</a>). Identification of Y chromosome gene sequences (<em>SRY</em>) in the plasma sample confirms the presence of fetal cfDNA and validates the test results. If the fetus is female, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are not common to the general population can be used to confirm fetal cfDNA in the sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Maternal SNPs are identified in the white cells (maternal) of the buffy coat. A significant difference in the types of SNPs between the buffy coat and the plasma (at least six different SNPs) indicates paternally-acquired SNPs in the plasma, thereby confirming the presence of fetal cfDNA and validating the test result. The hypermethylated&nbsp;<em>RASSF1A </em>promoter has also been reported as a universal fetal marker to confirm the presence of fetal DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>False positive results have been attributed to phenotypically Rh(D)-negative mothers who carry the <em>RHD</em> pseudogene or another <em>RHD</em> gene variation and pass this gene on to their fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The <em>RHD</em> pseudogene has been described in 69 percent of South African blacks and 24 percent of African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In this situation, all 10 exons of the <em>RHD</em> gene are present; however, translation of the gene into a messenger RNA product does not occur because of a stop codon in the intron between exons 3 and 4. Therefore, no Rh(D) protein is synthesized, and the patient is serologically Rh(D)-negative. The <em>RHD</em> pseudogene can often be detected by using primers targeting exons 4 and 10 of the <em>RHD</em> gene. Such false positives, if not detected, could result in unnecessary invasive interventions. If <em>RHD</em> pseudogenes are suspected, the cfDNA result will return as &quot;indeterminate&quot;; testing fetal DNA in amniocytes is then recommended. In these cases, maternal and paternal blood samples should accompany the amniotic fluid for laboratory analysis. As with any cfDNA test, a vanishing twin or graft-derived cfDNA in women with organ transplantation are other potential sources of false-positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>False negative results would be more serious as appropriate monitoring and interventions might be withheld. More than one D region (eg, exons 7 and 10, intron 4) should be examined to ensure that negative results reflect true <em>RHD</em> negativity and not the presence of D variants. False negatives can also be due to a low level of fetal cfDNA in a maternal sample because it was drawn too early in gestation (&lt;8 weeks of gestation) or to insensitive laboratory techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. We consider the false negative rate of cfDNA sufficiently low that we do not obtain serial titers when cfDNA indicates an <em>RHD</em>-negative fetus. False negatives will be identified soon after delivery as all newborns routinely undergo direct Coombs testing through cord blood sample analysis at birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112596109\"><span class=\"h3\">Amniocentesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If cfDNA testing is not available, fetal <em>RHD</em> gene status can be determined by PCR on uncultured amniocytes obtained by amniocentesis after 15 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Because this is an invasive procedure, it is reserved for pregnancies in which a critical titer is reached or exceeded (discussed below) and the father is heterozygous for <em>RHD</em>, paternal zygosity is unknown, paternal Rh(D) type is unknown, or noninvasive testing was inconclusive due to <em>RHD</em> pseudogene or a low amount of fetal DNA. However, if a woman with titers below the critical level is undergoing amniocentesis for another indication (eg, diagnosis of aneuploidy), it is reasonable to determine fetal <em>RHD </em>gene status at that time as well.</p><p>Transplacental amniocentesis should be avoided, if possible, as it may worsen alloimmunization (chorionic villus biopsy is avoided for the same reason [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]). The magnitude of this risk is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63000749\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow maternal anti-D titers in at risk fetuses until the critical titer is reached</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the first alloimmunized pregnancy with a fetus at risk of HDFN, the indirect Coombs titer (ie, indirect antiglobulin test) is repeated monthly as long as it remains stable; rising titers should be repeated every two weeks until the titer reaches the &quot;critical&quot; level.</p><p>Serial titers should be determined by the same laboratory since variation in titers among laboratories is common. Intra-laboratory variation also occurs, but a truly stable titer should not vary by more than one dilution when repeated in a given laboratory. As an example, a titer of 2 that increases to 4 may not represent a true increase in the amount of antibody in the maternal circulation, but a rise to 8 is likely real. Of note, maternal administration of anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> after the primary immune response to the D antigen has occurred will not prevent a rise in titer and anti-D immune globulin should not be administered to sensitized women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>A critical titer has historically been defined as the titer associated with a risk for development of severe anemia and hydrops fetalis at a particular institution. Below the critical titer, the fetus is at risk for developing mild to moderate, but not severe, anemia. However, given the decreased incidence of Rh(D) alloimmunization in pregnancy, most institutions lack sufficient patients to establish a critical titer and therefore consider an anti-D titer between 16 and 32 as a critical value. In Europe and the United Kingdom, a threshold value of 15 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> is the critical value, based upon comparison with an international standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>If the critical titer is reached or exceeded, further assessment is required to determine whether the Rh(D)-positive fetus is severely anemic. Maternal titers are screening tests, not diagnostic of severe anemia, and should be discontinued once a critical titer is reached.</p><p>If fetal <em>RHD</em> type has not yet been determined by cfDNA testing, examination of amniocytes, or certain <em>RHD</em> homozygous paternity, we recommend fetal <em>RHD</em> evaluation at this point to avoid potentially unnecessary serial Doppler ultrasound monitoring and fetal blood sampling. Maternal indirect Coombs titers can rise even though the fetus is Rh(D)-negative; the reason is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H321054809\"><span class=\"h2\">Assess for severe anemia in fetuses at risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the critical titer is reached or exceeded and the fetus is <em>RHD</em>-positive, Doppler velocimetry of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak systolic velocity (PSV) is performed to identify fetuses that may be severely anemic. Doppler assessment of the fetal MCA-PSV is based on the principle that the fetal hemoglobin level determines blood flow in the MCA: MCA-PSV increases as fetal hemoglobin level falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A 2009 systematic review including nine observational studies provided compelling evidence that Doppler interrogation of the MCA-PSV performs well as a screening tool for severe fetal anemia of any etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. When severe anemia was defined as fetal hemoglobin &lt;0.55 multiples of the median (MoMs) for gestational age, sensitivity and specificity were 75.5 and 90.8 percent, respectively. In the seminal study included in this review, both hemoglobin level in blood obtained by cordocentesis and MCA-PSV were measured in 111 fetuses at risk for anemia due to maternal red cell alloimmunization and compared with values in 265 normal fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The sensitivity of increased MCA-PSV (above 1.5 MoMs) for the prediction of moderate or severe anemia was 100 percent (95% CI 86-100), either in the presence or absence of hydrops, with a false positive rate of 12 percent. The same authors conducted a follow-up prospective study of 125 fetuses at risk for alloimmune anemia and reported the overall performance of MCA-PSV for moderate to severe anemia (hemoglobin level below 0.65 MoMs) was sensitivity 88 percent, specificity 87 percent, positive predictive value 53 percent, and negative predictive value 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. One of nine fetuses with severe anemia was missed, possibly due to a screening interval longer than two weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7289715\"><span class=\"h3\">Other methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amniotic fluid bilirubin levels and fetal blood sampling are other methods for evaluating the fetus for anemia, but are rarely used.</p><p>Amniocentesis to determine amniotic fluid bilirubin levels (delta OD<sub>450</sub>) had been the traditional method for indirectly estimating the severity of fetal anemia. Bilirubin in amniotic fluid derives from fetal pulmonary and tracheal effluents and correlates with the degree of fetal hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. However, Doppler velocimetry is as, or more, sensitive and specific for detection of severe fetal anemia and has the advantage of being noninvasive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. For these reasons, delta OD<sub>450</sub> assay is no longer readily available at most commercial laboratories.</p><p>Fetal blood can be sampled to precisely determine the severity of fetal anemia, but this procedure carries a 1 to 2 percent risk of fetal loss, with the highest risk at lower gestational ages and in hydropic fetuses (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-blood-sampling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal blood sampling&quot;</a>).

Because MCA-PSV increases across gestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76467\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76467 \">figure 1</a>), results should be adjusted for gestational age.

Experts suggest one- to two-week intervals based on clinical experience and what is known about progression of fetal anemia in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The frequency is increased if indicated by MoMs approaching 1.5.

Ideally, the measurement is obtained when the fetus is in a quiet behavioral state, as results are higher when the fetus is active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133181085\"><span class=\"h3\">MCA-PSV &le;1.5 MoMs for gestational age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An MCA-PSV &le;1.5 MoMs for gestational age is consistent with absence of moderate to severe anemia.

In addition, we begin weekly antenatal testing at 32 weeks of gestation. Historically, alloimmunization has been considered an indication for antepartum fetal surveillance, although no well-designed studies have evaluated the utility, type, or frequency of testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

If the hemoglobin is above this threshold, we obtain another fetal blood sample in one to two weeks, depending on the value.

A woman whose prior pregnancy was complicated by fetal hydrops, intrauterine fetal transfusion, preterm delivery because of severe fetal anemia, or neonatal exchange transfusion can expect development of severe fetal anemia in subsequent pregnancies with an Rh(D)-positive fetus. The severe anemia occurs earlier in gestation than in the prior pregnancy; a case report described severe anemia as early as 15 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Management of these pregnancies is illustrated in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103190\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103190 \">algorithm 3</a>). We obtain a baseline maternal titer as an extremely high titer suggests the need for immunomodulation (see <a href=\"#H63001766\" class=\"local\">'Special issues'</a> below).

MCA-PSV-based management is similar to that described above for first alloimmunized pregnancies, but measurement of MCA-PSV is usually undertaken weekly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

There are no specific guidelines for management of these pregnancies; they are typically managed as described above. The presence of other red cell antibodies (especially anti-C) with anti-D antibody appears to be associated with a more aggressive maternal immune response, thus increasing the risk of severe anemia and need for intrauterine fetal transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H63000876\" class=\"local\">'Management of the first alloimmunized pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An Rh(D)-negative fetus is not at risk for complications from maternal anti-D antibodies; therefore, one of the initial steps in antenatal management of maternal Rh(D) alloimmunization is to determine the fetal <em>RHD</em> type. (See <a href=\"#H133180338\" class=\"local\">'Determine whether the fetus is at risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the biologic father of the fetus is Rh(D)-negative, the fetus must also be Rh(D)-negative. An Rh(D)-negative fetus is not at risk for hemolytic disease, and further evaluation, monitoring, and intervention are unnecessary. Documentation of the discussion regarding paternity should be included in the medical record.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the biologic father of the fetus is Rh(D)-positive, paternal zygosity is determined. All offspring of <em>RHD</em>-positive homozygotes will be Rh(D)-positive so further testing for fetal Rh(D) type is unnecessary. Heterozygotes have a 50 percent chance of having Rh(D)-negative offspring, so in these cases we determine fetal <em>RHD</em> type noninvasively using cell free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal plasma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F86944\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86944 \">algorithm 2</a>). If the biologic father of the fetus is unavailable for testing or paternity is uncertain, we determine fetal <em>RHD</em> type by cfDNA testing. (See <a href=\"#H133180553\" class=\"local\">'Cell free DNA testing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H376460381\" class=\"local\">'Paternal zygosity testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the fetus is <em>RHD</em>-positive, the indirect Coombs titer (ie, indirect antiglobulin test) is repeated monthly as long as it remains stable; rising titers should be repeated every two weeks. The critical titer (the titer associated with a risk for development of severe anemia and hydrops fetalis) varies among laboratories and by methodologies; however, in most centers, an anti-D titer between 16 and 32 is considered critical. In Europe and the United Kingdom, a threshold value of 15 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> is the critical value, based upon comparison with an international standard. (See <a href=\"#H63000749\" class=\"local\">'Follow maternal anti-D titers in at risk fetuses until the critical titer is reached'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the critical titer is reached or exceeded and the fetus is <em>RHD</em>-positive, further assessment by Doppler velocimetry is performed to determine whether the fetus is severely anemic. Doppler interrogation of the fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak systolic velocity (PSV) is the best tool for predicting moderate to severe fetal anemia in at-risk pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H321054809\" class=\"local\">'Assess for severe anemia in fetuses at risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We measure MCA-PSV at one- to two-week intervals. The frequency is increased if indicated by multiples of the median (MoMs) approaching 1.5. An MCA-PSV &le;1.5 MoMs for gestational age is consistent with absence of moderate to severe anemia. If MCA-PSV remains at this level, we schedule delivery at 37 to 38 weeks of gestation. In addition, we begin weekly antenatal testing at 32 weeks of gestation. (See <a href=\"#H133181085\" class=\"local\">'MCA-PSV &le;1.5 MoMs for gestational age'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnancies with MCA-PSV &gt;1.5 MoMs for gestational age, we obtain fetal blood by cordocentesis for hemoglobin determination and perform an intrauterine fetal transfusion if fetal hemoglobin is two standard deviations below the mean value for gestational age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53399 \">table 1</a>).
