A hair follicle is a sac under the skin where a hair starts to grow. Usually, folliculitis happens because bacteria (a kind of germ) get into the hair follicle. Occasionally, folliculitis is caused by a fungus or virus in the hair follicle, or because of another reason.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662986\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of folliculitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is a group of small, raised red bumps on your skin. These bumps can be tender or itchy, and they might have pus in them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663003\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do on my own to treat it?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wet a clean washcloth with warm water and put it on the bumps. When the cloth cools, reheat it with warm water and put it back on the area. Repeat these steps for 10 to 15 minutes, 3 times a day.</p><p>Do not shave the area that has folliculitis. That will just irritate it more and might spread the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663018\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if the folliculitis does not go away after you treat it at home. You should also see your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bumps get larger or more painful.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bumps go away but then come back.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You get a fever.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663033\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not usually. To make sure you do not have another skin condition, your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. If it is hard to tell what is causing your folliculitis, he or she might test a sample of pus, or do a different test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663048\"><span class=\"h1\">What other treatment might I have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your folliculitis does not go away on its own, your doctor might prescribe an antibiotic cream. If a lot of your skin is affected, you might need an antibiotic pill. But most cases of folliculitis get better without treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663063\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=boil-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Boil (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
