Adverse food reactions can be divided into food allergies, which are immunologically mediated, and all other reactions, which are nonimmunologic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51225 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Adverse food reactions are common and often assumed by patients to be allergic in nature. However, nonimmunologic reactions to food are more common than true food allergies.

The terms &quot;allergy&quot; and &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; are used interchangeably in this topic review. There are multiple types of food allergy, each with distinct clinical and pathophysiologic features. Food allergies are broadly categorized into either immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated or non-IgE-mediated processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Some disorders, such as atopic dermatitis or the eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs), have characteristics of both mechanisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic reviews the clinical manifestations of the different categories of food allergies. Other aspects of food allergy are discussed separately.

IgE-mediated reactions to carbohydrate allergens in meats, a type of reaction reported mainly in adults, represent an exception to this temporal pattern since these reactions begin four to six hours after ingestion. Most patients react to one or two specific <span class=\"nowrap\">foods/food</span> groups, although an increasing number of patients react to multiple foods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-to-meats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy to meats&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Signs and symptoms can involve the skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and cardiovascular system and are believed to be caused by mediator release from tissue mast cells and circulating basophils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448 \">table 2</a>). Two distinct presentations are the oral allergy syndrome and food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIAn). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis#H349993124\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Acute diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic pitfalls'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Urticaria and angioedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute urticaria and angioedema are probably the most common cutaneous manifestations of food hypersensitivity reactions, generally appearing within minutes of ingestion of the food allergen. Food allergy may account for 20 percent of cases of acute urticaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

In this condition, urticaria develops only on skin that was in direct contact with the food. In addition to the common allergens, raw meats, seafood, raw vegetables and fruits, mustard, rice, and beer are among the foods that have been implicated in this form of reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6558107\"><span class=\"h2\">Oropharyngeal symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oropharyngeal symptoms can occur in isolation or as part of a systemic reaction to a food (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448 \">table 2</a>). Symptoms may occur in isolation because the allergy is mild, not much allergen was ingested, or the allergen is labile, as is seen in oral allergy syndrome.</p><p>Oral allergy syndrome, or pollen-food allergy syndrome, is considered a form of contact allergy that is common in patients with allergic rhinitis to pollen. It is caused by the presence of heat, acid, and digestive enzyme-sensitive proteins (eg, profilins) within these foods that are cross reactive with allergenic pollen proteins. Symptoms are confined almost exclusively to the oropharynx and include the immediate onset of pruritus, irritation, and mild swelling of the lips, tongue, palate, and throat upon ingestion of fresh, uncooked fruits and vegetables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Cooked fruits and vegetables typically do not elicit the symptoms. Symptoms usually subside within minutes after ingestion ceases. However, progression to systemic symptoms can occur, and anaphylaxis has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Symptoms may be more noticeable during the associated pollen season. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As examples, a birch-allergic patient may develop itching of the lips or mouth upon eating apple, pear, cherry, carrot, celery, and potato, while a ragweed-allergic patient may react to melons and banana, and a mugwort-allergic patient may react to celery or mustard (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60787 \">figure 1</a>). Tree nuts and peanuts can also cause isolated oral symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory tract symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma and environmental allergies (allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis) are more common in children with food allergy. In addition, conjunctival, nasal, and lower respiratory tract symptoms are common components of systemic food allergic reactions (ie, anaphylaxis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58836\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58836 \">table 3</a>). However, isolated allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or asthma in response to foods is rare. An exception is occupational asthma (sometimes with accompanying rhinitis) in food industry workers. &quot;Baker's asthma,&quot; caused by IgE-mediated allergy to inhaled wheat proteins, is an example [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients with these conditions may not react to the food upon ingestion.

The term &quot;gastrointestinal anaphylaxis&quot; is used when gastrointestinal symptoms occur in isolation. However, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely the sole manifestations of a food-allergic reaction. More commonly, gastrointestinal symptoms occur in conjunction with involvement of other target organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. The onset of upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) is generally minutes to two hours after ingestion of the offending food, but lower gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, can begin two to six hours after ingestion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis is defined as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients may develop a combination of symptoms and signs related to the cutaneous, respiratory, gastrointestinal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiovascular systems that constitute anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58836\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58836 \">table 3</a>). Anaphylactic reactions may culminate in hypotension, vascular collapse, cardiac dysrhythmias, or death. Anaphylaxis occasionally follows a biphasic course, with a recurrence of symptoms hours after the initial onset. Skin symptoms may be absent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>FDEIAn describes an anaphylactic response that occurs only if the patient exercises or exerts himself or herself within two to four hours of ingestion of food. These reactions seem to be most prevalent in adolescents and young adults, although they can occur in patients of any age. Common causative foods include wheat, celery, and seafood. The food can be ingested in the absence of exercise without development of symptoms. Some patients react after eating any food prior to exercise. These patients also have no reactions in the absence of exertion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of FDEIAn'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to exercise, other cofactors may increase the risk that a food allergen will elicit anaphylaxis rather than a mild reaction, including menstruation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, elevated body temperature, acute infections, and antacids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">NON-IgE-MEDIATED REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergies present as more subacute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic symptoms that are typically isolated to the gastrointestinal tract <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin.

In addition, certain disorders are associated with systemic manifestations. Chronic vomiting and diarrhea, particularly if accompanied by failure to thrive, suggests disorders such as food protein-induced enteropathy, celiac disease, FPIES, or an eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder (EGID). EGIDs are mixed IgE and non-IgE-mediated reactions and are discussed further below.

The most common trigger is cow's milk in the mother's diet, although it can also occur in formula-fed infants. This disorder typically presents between two and eight weeks of age and resolves in a few days with complete elimination of the offending protein.

The stools are typically watery, with occasional mucus, although grossly bloody diarrhea (melena) is possible. The vomiting is intermittent in the chronic setting but can be severe and can lead to dehydration. Patients may also have malabsorption. Poor weight <span class=\"nowrap\">gain/failure</span> to thrive is common. Laboratory abnormalities include hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and leukocytosis. Symptoms of FPIES resolve upon elimination of the causative food, although it may take several weeks to a month to start to see an improvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the causative food is later reintroduced, there is a characteristic delayed onset (approximately two to four hours) of profuse vomiting, followed by return of the other signs and symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87555\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87555 \">table 5</a>). Children can require emergency treatment for hypotension, lethargy, or shock in this setting, and laboratory studies may show acidosis, methemoglobinemia, and an increase in neutrophils. The acute manifestations of FPIES can be clinically identical to IgE-mediated gastrointestinal anaphylaxis; therefore, testing is usually necessary to determine if food-specific IgE is present. (See <a href=\"#H3198815\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">FPIES in older children and adults is rare and typically presents a milder syndrome of nausea, protracted vomiting, and cramping several hours after ingestion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">FPIES is uncommon in exclusively breastfed infants.

It classically presents in infants and young children with chronic diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal distension and pain, failure to thrive or weight loss, and sometimes also vomiting. The gastrointestinal manifestations are similar in older children and adults but usually milder and include steatorrhea, weight loss, and other signs of nutrient or vitamin deficiency due to malabsorption. Flatulence and steatorrhea are suggestive of celiac disease rather than other forms of food-protein-induced enteropathy or FPIES.

Infants and young children may present with feeding disorders and failure to thrive, whereas older children and adults typically present with dysphagia, vomiting, and abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A history of food impaction is common, particularly in adolescents and adults. Failure to respond to antacids and antireflux therapies is an important aspect of the history. Many patients with EoE have other atopic diseases. The most commonly implicated foods in children are cow's milk, egg, soy, corn, wheat, and beef, and most patients with evidence of food sensitivity tested positive for multiple foods. Elimination or elemental diets result in clinical and histologic improvement in most.

In adolescents and adults, it can mimic irritable bowel syndrome. Symptoms vary depending on the layer and portion of the gastrointestinal tract that is involved. Approximately one-half of patients have allergic disease, such as defined food sensitivities, asthma, eczema, or rhinitis. However, food allergy testing has not been shown to effectively identify specific culprit foods. An empiric elimination diet or elemental diet may improve symptoms and histologic findings in up to half of patients.

Food allergies are broadly categorized into either immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated or non-IgE-mediated processes. Some disorders have characteristics of both mechanisms. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgE-mediated food allergy typically develops rapidly after food ingestion (ie, usually within minutes). Symptoms can affect one or more organ systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448 \">table 2</a>). Isolated allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or asthma in response to foods is rare. Specific disorders include cutaneous reactions (urticaria, angioedema), anaphylaxis (including food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis [FDEIAn]), and oral allergy syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'IgE-mediated reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-IgE-mediated food allergies present as more subacute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic symptoms, which are typically isolated to the gastrointestinal tract. The type of gastrointestinal signs and symptoms may vary in some disorders, depending upon whether the food is consumed regularly or infrequently. In addition, certain disorders are associated with systemic manifestations. Specific syndromes include food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced <span class=\"nowrap\">proctitis/proctocolitis,</span> celiac disease, and food-induced pulmonary hemosiderosis (Heiner syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Non-IgE-mediated reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both IgE and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms can be involved in atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs). Food allergies may exacerbate atopic dermatitis, especially in young children with more severe eczema. Infants and young children with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) may present with feeding disorders, whereas older children and adults typically present with dysphagia, vomiting, and abdominal pain. A history of food impaction is common, particularly in adolescents and adults. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis can present at any age with abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight loss. In infants, it may present as outlet obstruction with postprandial projectile vomiting. In adolescents and adults, it can mimic irritable bowel syndrome. Symptoms vary depending on the layer and portion of the gastrointestinal tract that is involved. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Mixed IgE and non-IgE-mediated reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of food allergy consists of a number of nonimmunologic food reactions and disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51225 \">table 1</a>). In addition, each specific type of food allergy has an extensive differential diagnosis that includes disorders that are not related to food.
