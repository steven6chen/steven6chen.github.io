The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed criteria that define SSI as infection related to an operative procedure that occurs at or near the surgical incision within 30 days of the procedure, or within 90 days if prosthetic material is implanted at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. SSIs are often localized to the incision site but can also extend into deeper adjacent structures.

It is estimated that SSIs develop in 2 to 5 percent of the more than 30 million patients undergoing surgical procedures each year (ie, 1 in 24 patients who undergo inpatient surgery in the United States has a postoperative SSI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and the Surgical Care Improvement Project promote a number of interventions to improve patient care and prevent avoidable deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. These include several interventions for reducing the incidence of SSIs discussed in the following sections. In one report, hospitals that instituted programs for appropriate use of antibiotics, approach to hair removal, glucose management, and thermoregulation reported a mean 27 percent reduction in SSI rates over one year (from 2.3 to 1.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In another study including more than 400,000 surgical patients, those who received at least two of the above measures had lower rates of SSI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The general measures for the prevention of SSI are reviewed here.

Several issues may impact the timing of surgery and its relationship with risk of SSI, including emergency surgery, cancer therapy, remote infection, and malnutrition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973491628\"><span class=\"h3\">Emergency surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients undergoing emergency or urgent surgical procedures have higher risk of adverse outcomes, including SSI. In some instances, temporizing measures can be used to convert an emergency situation to a more elective situation or to optimize patient physiology and tissue perfusion.</p><p>As an example, for the treatment of colonic obstruction, stenting can be used in the interim.

The risk for smokers who have quit is intermediate between current smokers and those who have never smoked. Smoking cessation four to six weeks is recommended prior to elective surgery to reduce the risk of pulmonary complications; smoking cessation also reduces wound complications including SSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].

The overall complication rate was significantly reduced for the smoking intervention group (18 versus 52 percent). Wound-related complications were also significantly reduced (overall: 5 versus 31 percent; surgical site infection: 4 versus 23 percent).</p><p>Smoking cessation is particularly important to surgeries that involve the creation of flaps, such as flap-based breast reconstruction after mastectomy, and other reconstructive procedures. A large review from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database evaluated outcomes for a variety of plastic surgery procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Confidential rates can be reported as surgeon specific, service specific, and hospital-wide and may be categorized within discrete risk index scores. Identifying and monitoring SSI rates among outpatients can be difficult. Methodologies include surveillance by patients and healthcare personnel (including physicians and nurses), surveillance via pharmacy records, and surveillance via health plan records [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>].

Careful infection control is essential; interventions include hand hygiene and use of gloves and other barrier devices (masks, caps, gowns, drapes, and shoe covers) by all operating room personnel. Application of antiseptics to the skin is warranted to reduce the burden of skin flora. (See <a href=\"#H266898457\" class=\"local\">'Infection control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with evidence of active infection prior to elective surgical procedures should complete treatment for the infection prior to surgery, particularly in circumstances when placement of prosthetic material is anticipated. For circumstances in which urgent surgery is required, the risk of infection must be weighed with the timing of surgical intervention on an individual basis. (See <a href=\"#H2898229120\" class=\"local\">'Timing of surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <strong>not</strong> using routine preoperative <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> screening and decolonization for patients undergoing surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The optimal approach to <em>S. aureus</em> screening and decolonization remains uncertain and should be tailored to individual clinical circumstances. Preoperative <em>S. aureus</em> decolonization may be reasonable for surgical patients known to be nasal carriers of <em>S. aureus</em> with a high risk of negative outcomes should <em>S. aureus</em> infection develop at the surgical site (eg, cardiothoracic surgery, orthopedic procedures with hardware implantation, patients who are immunocompromised). (See <a href=\"#H1189641077\" class=\"local\">'S. aureus decolonization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Good surgical technique reduces the risk of SSIs; such practices include gentle traction, effective hemostasis, removal of devitalized tissues, obliteration of dead space, irrigation of tissues with saline to avoid excessive drying, wound closure without tension, and judicious use of closed suction drains. Minimally invasive and laparoscopic-assisted procedures are generally associated with lower rates of SSI compared with open surgery. (See <a href=\"#H2930756557\" class=\"local\">'Surgical technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative normothermia appears to be better than hypothermia for reducing the risk of SSI. The use of high-inspired (supplemental) oxygen perioperatively is also associated with decreased rates of SSI. There is insufficient evidence for routine use of preoperative hair removal or laminar airflow for reducing the risk of SSI. (See <a href=\"#H1528746953\" class=\"local\">'Other perioperative measures'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Consensus paper on the surveillance of surgical wound infections.
