the child's age, sex, clinical presentation, past history, and family history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1623112441\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In assessing the patient's bleeding history, it is important to ask about prior bleeding episodes and to characterize the type of bleeding (<a

mucous membranes is characteristic of disorders of platelets and their interaction with blood vessels (purpuric disorders) and may be manifested as petechiae <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ecchymoses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding into soft tissue, muscle, and joints suggests the presence of hemophilia or other disorders of coagulation proteins.</p><p/><p>Bleeding symptoms do occur in healthy children and may not necessarily suggest a generalized bleeding disorder. For example, epistaxis may be caused by rhinitis, trauma, superficial vessels, or dry air. However, symptoms that occur with unusual frequency, duration, or severity should prompt consideration of an underlying bleeding disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Abnormal post-procedural bleeding (eg, following tonsillectomy, circumcision, tooth extraction) may occur simply due to surgical trauma; however, it may also suggest the possibility of an underlying bleeding disorder, particularly if the child has had a prior history of bleeding symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications#H7658129\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) in children: Postoperative care and complications&quot;, section on 'Hemorrhage'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should be alert to the possibility that bruising or bleeding judged to be abnormal (eg, due to frequency, duration, or severity of episodes, or lack of explanation for symptoms or physical findings) may be caused by a bleeding disorder or by nonaccidental injury (ie, child abuse). Furthermore, child abuse and bleeding disorders are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, the history should include complete details as to the type of bleeding, location, degree of symptoms, nature of provoking injuries, and whether such injuries are consistent with the child's development and level of activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a prospective study that followed 433 young children (58 with severe bleeding disorders, 47 with mild bleeding disorders, and 328 without bleeding disorders) over a period of 12 weeks, children with bleeding disorders had more and larger bruises compared with those without bleeding disorders, especially at premobile stages of development (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">nonrolling/rolling</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">over/sitting)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Bruising was uncommon among premobile infants without bleeding disorders or with only mild bleeding disorders (noted at 7 percent of assessments in both groups). By contrast, premobile infants with severe bleeding disorders were noted to have bruises at 52 percent of assessments. Among early mobile <span class=\"nowrap\">(crawling/cruising)</span> and ambulatory children, bruising was common in all groups, noted in 50 to 80 percent of those without bleeding disorders and &gt;90 percent of children with severe bleeding disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An inherited bleeding disorder should be strongly considered when the onset of bleeding manifestations occurs in infancy or early childhood, particularly if associated with a positive family history.</p><p>The following are examples of typical presentations suggestive of an underlying bleeding disorder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A newborn with bleeding from the umbilical stump should be evaluated for coagulation protein defects, including factor XIII deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Intracranial hemorrhage in an infant without other risk factors should also prompt consideration of this diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rare inherited coagulation disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A male infant who is starting to walk and presents with a painful swollen joint after a fall is presumed to have hemophilia until proven otherwise. Similarly, an unusually prominent forehead hematoma (&quot;goose-egg&quot;) in a male infant or young boy is a common presentation of hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], as is excess bleeding after circumcision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;, section on 'Initial presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An otherwise healthy child who presents with petechiae <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mucocutaneous purpura in the wake of a viral infection most likely has acute postinfectious immune thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>].

The presence of bleeding manifestations only in male siblings and maternal uncles is suggestive of X-linked recessive inheritance, such as that seen in hemophilia A or B. However, a negative family history does not exclude an inherited coagulation disorder, as up to one-third of patients with hemophilia have a negative family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hemophilia A and B&quot;, section on 'Genetic transmission'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, in autosomal dominant disorders such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu disease), an accurate pedigree will show affected individuals of both sexes for several generations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Most instances of VWD are also transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. In autosomal recessive disorders, such as severe forms of the rarer coagulation factor deficiencies (eg, factor VII or factor XI deficiency), the family history may be negative; consanguinity increases the probability of such disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In particular, specific information should be sought about the ingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a>, aspirin-containing over-the-counter medications, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naproxen</a>. Such drugs impair platelet function and may exacerbate an underlying coagulation disorder. It is important to ask about recent use (ie, within one to two weeks) of these agents even if they are not the suspected cause of the bruising or bleeding in the child because they may cause abnormalities in platelet function tests, which may lead to further unnecessary and expensive studies.</p><p>Accidental or intentional ingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">warfarin</a> or warfarin-containing rodenticides can also cause bleeding symptoms in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning#H1569311674\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of rodenticide poisoning&quot;, section on 'Anticoagulants (superwarfarins and warfarins)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1963852792\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No single test reliably screens the overall process of hemostasis, particularly for abnormalities of platelet function or the fibrinolytic pathway. The evaluation for bleeding disorders in children begins with general screening tests that assess hemostasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80791\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80791 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60745\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60745 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82633\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82633 \">algorithm 2</a>).

For example, in an otherwise well child who presents with mucocutaneous bleeding, a CBC, platelet count, and examination of the peripheral blood smear are the most informative initial tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82633\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82633 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Normal values of coagulation tests may vary with age and among different laboratories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66999\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66999 \">table 3</a>). In particular, normal PTs and aPTTs should be based upon an individual clinical laboratory's reference ranges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; published ranges should not be used to conclusively ascertain whether an individual result is normal or abnormal.</p><p>Proper collection of the blood sample is essential for interpreting the results of coagulation tests. Blood for coagulation tests should not be drawn from an existing heparinized indwelling line. A cleanly drawn venipuncture sample without air bubbles or tissue fluid contamination is the most appropriate sample for coagulation tests. Coagulation tests are performed on blood anticoagulated with a solution of sodium citrate in a ratio of nine parts of blood to one part of citrate. When the hematocrit is high (eg, newborns and children with cyanotic cardiac disease), the amount of citrate must be adjusted (reduced) to provide the proper ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;, section on 'Sample collection and handling'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Platelet count and the peripheral smear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The platelet count is performed most commonly using automated cell counters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-hematology-instrumentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated hematology instrumentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Platelets may also be counted directly on the blood smear. Examination of the peripheral blood smear is essential in patients with low platelet counts in order to exclude the presence of pseudothrombocytopenia caused by platelet aggregation after using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an in vitro anticoagulant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68949\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68949 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Platelet aggregation causes falsely low platelet counts by the automated cell counter, but the platelet clumps are obvious on examination of the smear. Alternative anticoagulants (eg, trisodium citrate or heparin) may circumvent in vitro EDTA-associated platelet aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Platelet clumping on the smear of a patient with bleeding symptoms may also suggest type 2B von Willebrand disease (VWD) or pseudo (platelet type) VWD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82633\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82633 \">algorithm 2</a>).

In addition, it permits assessment of platelet size, which helps to narrow the diagnostic possibilities in a patient with thrombocytopenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89962 \">table 4</a>).

The functioning of these pathways is measured by the PT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79998 \">figure 1</a>). This test bypasses the intrinsic pathway and uses &quot;complete&quot; thromboplastins (ie, tissue factor) capable of activating the extrinsic pathway.</p><p>The PT is sensitive to alterations in the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, especially factors II, VII, and X, and is used to monitor treatment with vitamin K antagonists.

It is called &quot;partial&quot; because clotting is initiated in vitro with agents that are only partial thromboplastins (ie, they are incapable of activating the extrinsic pathway). This aPTT is routinely used to evaluate intrinsic coagulation and the degree of heparin anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;, section on 'Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)'</a>.)</p><p>The aPTT is sensitive to deficiencies of factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII and to inhibitors such as heparin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79998 \">figure 1</a>). It is less sensitive than the PT to deficiencies within the common pathway (eg, factors X and V, prothrombin, and fibrinogen) and is unaffected by alterations in factors VII and XIII. Although high levels of a single factor (eg, factor VIII) can shorten the aPTT, whether an association exists between a shortened aPTT and a hypercoagulable state remains controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests#H311052\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;, section on 'Shortened PT and/or aPTT'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11962280\"><span class=\"h3\">Fibrinogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional fibrinogen concentration is most commonly measured using a sensitized modification of the thrombin time (TT), whereas structural (antigenic) levels are measured by immunologic assays. Immunologic and functional assays of fibrinogen may be discordant in patients with an inherited dysfibrinogenemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-fibrinogen\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of fibrinogen&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most cases of clinically significant fibrinogen disorders, the PT and aPTT are both prolonged.

Reptilase, a thrombin-like enzyme obtained from snake venom, differs from thrombin by generating fibrinopeptide A but not fibrinopeptide B from fibrinogen and by resisting inhibition by heparin via antithrombin III.

Bleeding into the skin and mucous membranes is characteristic of disorders of platelets or their interactions with blood vessels, while coagulation disorders classically feature musculoskeletal (ie, muscle and joint) and soft tissue bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79737\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79737 \">table 1</a>). The nature and extent of the injuries producing bleeding symptoms should be noted. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reasonable initial screening evaluation includes complete blood count, including platelet count; examination of the peripheral blood smear; prothrombin time; and activated partial thromboplastin time. At the author's center, we also measure a fibrinogen level. Normal values may vary with age and among different laboratories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66999\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66999 \">table 3</a>). The results of the initial testing help differentiate among the different diagnostic possibilities in the child with bleeding symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80791\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80791 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60745\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60745 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82633\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82633 \">algorithm 2</a>).

These tests often are performed in order to confirm a specific diagnosis of an inherited or acquired factor deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H2624487761\" class=\"local\">'Second tier testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the initial screening evaluation is normal and suspicion remains high for a bleeding disorder, diagnostic possibilities include von Willebrand disease, some forms of mild hemophilia, platelet function disorders and fibrinolytic disorders (including factor XIII deficiency), and additional testing (or consultation with a hematologist) should be pursued. Vascular abnormalities (eg, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) and physical abuse should also be considered.
