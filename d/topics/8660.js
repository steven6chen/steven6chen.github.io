The iliotibial band runs down the outside of the thigh, from the hip bone to the top of the shinbone.</p><p>Iliotibial band syndrome commonly happens in runners, especially after they increase their workouts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87498903\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of iliotibial band syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iliotibial band syndrome causes an aching, burning pain on the outside of the knee. The pain sometimes spreads up the thigh to the hip. The pain happens when people run (or do other physical activity).</p><p>For some people, the pain lasts even after they finish their workout. Movements that make the pain worse include going up and down stairs, and standing up from a seated position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87498918\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have this condition by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87498933\"><span class=\"h1\">How is iliotibial band syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment usually involves a few parts.</p><p>The first part of treatment involves things you can do on your own to reduce your pain. To ease your symptoms, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest your knee and avoid activities or movements that make the pain worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put ice on the outside of your knee when it hurts or after activities that cause pain. You can put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the painful area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a pain-relieving medicine. Over-the-counter medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</p><p/><p>Another part of treatment involves exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles around your hip and knee. You can start these when your pain improves. Your doctor or nurse will show you which exercises and stretches to do. Or he or she will have you work with a physical therapist (exercise expert).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87498948\"><span class=\"h1\">Can iliotibial band syndrome be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help prevent getting iliotibial band syndrome again, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Replace your sneakers when they wear out.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Run on even surfaces (and not on uneven surfaces).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Run around a track in both directions (and not only in 1 direction).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ease up on your training and not run as far or as hard.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an expert check how you run to make sure you run the correct way.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87498963\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Knee pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Knee pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
