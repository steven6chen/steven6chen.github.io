The incidence of testicular cancer accounts worldwide is less than 10 per 100,000 men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; in the United States, there are approximately 400 deaths each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Testicular GCTs are more sensitive to systemic chemotherapy than most adult solid tumors. As a result, chemotherapy is the standard treatment for men with advanced seminoma or nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) and for those with persistently elevated serum tumor markers following orchiectomy. The success of chemotherapy in advanced disease has led to its use in selected men with stage I and II disease.</p><p>The management of men with stage I NSGCT following orchiectomy, including the choice between adjuvant chemotherapy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), and active surveillance, will be reviewed here. The management of men with stage II NSGCT and a general overview of the management of testicular GCTs are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stage-ii-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stage II nonseminomatous germ cell tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With only rare exceptions (eg, men who present with widely disseminated disease requiring emergent treatment), men with testicular cancer undergo a radical inguinal orchiectomy for diagnosis and initial treatment. If radiographic imaging studies show no evidence of regional or distant metastases and serum tumor markers are normal after orchiectomy, patients are defined as having clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110731\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110732 \">table 2</a>).

However, it is difficult to identify which patients with stage I NSGCT are at highest risk for recurrence and thus have the most to gain from adjuvant treatment. While treatment immediately following orchiectomy can reduce the risk of relapse, it represents overtreatment for most patients and can result in both short- and long-term complications. In addition, although the risk of recurrence is approximately 25 percent for men undergoing surveillance, treatment at the time of recurrence is almost always curative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Long-term disease-specific survival exceeds 99 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-care-of-long-term-testicular-cancer-survivors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the care of long-term testicular cancer survivors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Men with persistently elevated postorchiectomy serum tumor markers and normal imaging studies are defined as having clinical stage IS disease. Persistently elevated markers generally indicate the presence of metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Therefore, these patients should be treated with chemotherapy similarly to men with stage III disease.

The most widely used risk factors for recurrence in men undergoing surveillance following orchiectomy for clinical stage I disease include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphovascular invasion (LVI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Predominance of an embryonal carcinoma (EC) component in the primary tumor &ndash; Predominance is histologically defined when EC comprises a greater proportion of the tumor than any other individual germ cell tumor component.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic tumor stage T3 or T4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110731\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Men with testicular NSGCT and none of these risk factors have low-risk disease; the relapse rate for these men ranges from 10 to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3,4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,12</a>]. By contrast, men with any of these risk factors have high-risk disease; the risk of relapse ranges anywhere between 40 and 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3,4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,12</a>]. Men whose tumors comprise a predominance of EC and LVI appear to be at the highest risk of relapse, estimated to be over 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13-15</a>].</p><p>The clinical significance of EC as an independent prognostic risk factor for relapse is not entirely clear because in the vast majority of cases, these two factors coexist (ie, tumors that are predominantly EC typically have LVI, and tumors that have LVI usually have at least a small component of EC). At least three studies suggest that the mere presence of EC is a significant risk factor for relapse, but it is a relatively weak one compared with LVI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/13,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16-18</a>].</p><p>Interpreting studies of the prognostic significance of EC is complicated by the fact that different studies have used different measures to pathologically characterize EC, including whether EC is present or absent, whether it is predominant, or whether it is pure. These issues have made it more challenging to clarify its significance as an independent prognostic risk factor.</p><p>Studies that have evaluated the risk for relapse associated with EC <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> LVI include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series, men whose tumor had a predominance of EC without LVI had a relapse rate of &lt;20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, another series reported that men with pure EC (ie, tumor that is comprised entirely of EC) without LVI were associated with a relapse rate of 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several studies reported that men with LVI and no EC at all had relapse rates of 20 percent or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other research indicates that the risk of micrometastatic disease increases as the proportion of EC increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p>Additional data supporting the prognostic relevance of EC come from a Danish study of 1226 men with clinical stage I NSGCT undergoing surveillance between 1984 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The risk of relapse was 12 percent without any risk factors, 18 percent with LVI alone, 29 percent when the only risk factor was the presence of EC, and 41 percent when both EC and LVI were present. However, the reliability of this analysis is limited by the fact that the presence or absence of LVI was not reported for 44 percent of the subjects and was reported as present for only 14 percent. By comparison, other large studies have typically reported that at least 25 percent of tumors have LVI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3,4,10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,10,19</a>]. Of note, invasion of the rete testis was also associated with an increased risk of relapse, but this variable is not consistently reported in histopathology reports.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40926142\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveillance, adjuvant chemotherapy, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) are therapeutic options for men with clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F114315\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114315 \">algorithm 1</a>). Each approach is associated with a 99 percent rate of long-term disease-specific survival. Importantly, for men who are interested in fertility preservation, sperm banking should be performed prior to treatment with RPLND or chemotherapy.</p><p>The approach to management depends upon various factors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The likelihood of relapse (based on the presence of low- versus high-risk disease characteristics)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relative importance of the risk of relapse and of the different toxicities for an individual patient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability of a patient to adhere to posttreatment surveillance</p><p/><p>The importance of a multidisciplinary approach was illustrated in a Dutch study that included almost 1300 men with clinical stage I NSGCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relapse rate for the entire cohort at five years was 30.6 percent; the median time to relapse was five months. Despite this, the mortality rate was &lt;0.5 percent; only six men died of testicular cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of 356 patients treated with chemotherapy at the time of relapse, 98 underwent postchemotherapy resection of residual masses, indicating that 8 percent of the nearly 1300 men undergoing surveillance ended up receiving multimodality treatment (ie, chemotherapy followed by surgery).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40926150\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-risk disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For men with low-risk disease, reasonable options include active surveillance or adjuvant chemotherapy.

Although active surveillance is appropriate for most patients with low-risk disease, not all men will be comfortable with active surveillance, even if their risk of relapse is &quot;only&quot; approximately 10 to 15 percent. For men who express a preference for treatment at the time of initial diagnosis, adjuvant chemotherapy is also reasonable. For men who have access to a urological surgeon with extensive experience performing RPLNDs, surgery is also a very reasonable option and reduces the need for surveillance computed tomography (CT) scans; however, most urologists do not have such experience. In our view, men whose disease is comprised predominantly of teratoma are ideal candidates for RPLND.

Between 1998 and 2005, 745 men in Sweden and Norway were treated prospectively for clinical stage I NSGCTs.

Because all three options are associated with a greater than 99 percent disease-specific survival, there is no single best option for all patients.</p><p>One factor that must be taken into account if placing high-risk patients on surveillance, however, is the psychological stress of worrying about relapse and the potential psychological trauma to the patient if relapse occurs and his life must be put on hold on short notice and at an unpredictable time. One appeal of adjuvant chemotherapy after orchiectomy is the near certainty it provides that the disease has been cured, particularly in this high-risk group.</p><p>Therefore, the decision of which modality to use should be based on patient preference:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men with high-risk NSGCTs, active surveillance is a highly effective strategy with regard to long-term survival, although it leaves the patient with a substantial risk of recurrence (which would require treatment) at some point in the subsequent two to three years.

There were no relapses among the 70 patients who chose to receive two cycles of BEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Still, the mortality rate in the entire cohort was 1 percent (n = 8 deaths), none of which was from progressive disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2192884511\"><span class=\"h4\">Other data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefit of chemotherapy is also supported by a review of the data from available published nonrandomized studies performed by the authors of this topic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/11,21-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21-29</a>]. Among 655 men who received adjuvant chemotherapy for clinical stage I disease, there were only 16 relapses (2.4 percent), which occurred at a median follow-up ranging from 31 to 113 months. In addition, there were only seven cancer-related deaths identified (1 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2192884051\"><span class=\"h4\">One versus two cycles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All men who opt to proceed with chemotherapy should receive either one or two cycles of BEP. We prefer a single cycle rather than two. However, for men at the highest risk of relapse (ie, due to LVI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of pure EC), proceeding with two cycles of therapy is a reasonable option. Limiting treatment to up to two courses of platinum-based chemotherapy has reduced concerns of acute and delayed side effects of treatment (including a lowered risk of bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity), which are generally seen when four or more cycles are administered. There is also evidence that limiting the exposure to chemotherapy reduces the risk that men will become infertile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/21,22,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,30</a>].

While most guidelines advise a single cycle, some data indicate that for men with high-risk disease, two cycles produces a lower relapse rate. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 246 men treated with a single cycle of BEP for clinical stage I NSGCT reported that seven patients (2.8 percent) relapsed with a median follow-up of 39 months. Four relapses were cancers, and three were teratoma. At the time of reporting, three of four relapsing cancer patients were alive and had no evidence of cancer. The fourth patient who relapsed died of refractory disease. The three patients who relapsed with teratoma were all rendered disease free with resection. Two-year overall survival was 99.2 percent (95% CI 96.7-99.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study of primary chemotherapy for men with stage I NSGCT (considered to have an estimated relapse risk of at least 30 percent) reported a 6.5 percent relapse rate (3 of 46 patients) with a single cycle of BEP versus a rate of 2.9 percent (3 of 102 patients) with two cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The SWENOTECA group reported that among men with LVI, a single cycle of BEP was associated with a relapse rate of 3.2 percent (5 of 157 men) compared with a rate of 0 percent among 70 men treated with two cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among six studies that included a total of 402 men considered to have high-risk disease, the relapse rate following two cycles of BEP was 1.7 percent (n = 7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/10,22,26,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,22,26,32-34</a>].</p><p/><p>While patients receiving two cycles have had a numerically lower rate of relapse compared with those receiving one cycle, this difference may have been due to chance. Moreover, it is not clear that the small absolute benefit, if real, justifies the potential late toxicities of an additional cycle of chemotherapy. Long-term overall survival in this population is excellent regardless of the number of cycles given. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-care-of-long-term-testicular-cancer-survivors#H2639185\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the care of long-term testicular cancer survivors&quot;, section on 'Organ-specific effects of treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1228493581\"><span class=\"h3\">Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RPLND remains a reasonable alternative to chemotherapy, particularly for men with a teratoma-predominant tumor and for those patients who are not comfortable with active surveillance and decline chemotherapy for whatever reason. However, RPLND should only be performed if the technical expertise is available (ie, surgeons who perform at least 24 procedures annually, in our opinion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. When performed by experienced surgeons, RPLND is safe, with essentially no mortality and an extremely low rate of ejaculatory dysfunction or other long-term morbidity. In addition, the use of RPLND substantially reduces the number of men who ultimately receive chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retroperitoneal-lymph-node-dissection-for-early-stage-nonseminomatous-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for early stage nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unfortunately, very few centers have specialized surgeons sufficiently trained and experienced to perform a high-quality RPLND, and the effectiveness and safety of RPLND in less experienced hands may be compromised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, men should be aware that chemotherapy may still be required after RPLND. Among patients managed with RPLND, 20 percent are likely to be upstaged at final pathology and will undergo adjuvant chemotherapy with two cycles of either BEP or EP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stage-ii-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stage II nonseminomatous germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Pathologic stage II NSGCT'</a>.)</p><p>In the German testicular cancer study discussed above, 7 of the 15 patients (47 percent) who underwent RPLND had recurrent retroperitoneal disease, which may reflect a lack of experience in performing an RPLND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-nonseminomatous-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This high rate of relapse underscores the importance of the experience, knowledge, and skill of the surgeon. Referral to a center of excellence should be strongly considered for patients undergoing RPLND. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retroperitoneal-lymph-node-dissection-for-early-stage-nonseminomatous-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for early stage nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) has led to its integration into the management of patients with early stage disease. The goal of therapy is to reduce the likelihood of relapse and minimize overtreatment and treatment-related toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most widely evaluated histologic risk factors for recurrence in men undergoing surveillance following orchiectomy for clinical stage I disease include the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), the predominance of embryonal carcinoma (EC), and tumor stage above T2. (See <a href=\"#H178160589\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Men are at <strong>low risk</strong> if they have none of these risk factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Men are at <strong>high risk </strong>if they have any of the following: LVI, a predominance of EC, or a T3 or T4 primary tumor. Men with both LVI and a predominance of EC are at highest risk of relapse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men with low-risk disease, we recommend surveillance rather than adjuvant therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F114315\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114315 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). However, not all men will be comfortable with active surveillance, despite their excellent prognosis. For men who express a preference for treatment at the time of initial diagnosis, we suggest adjuvant BEP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>) for one cycle (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For men who have access to a urologist with extensive experience performing retroperitoneal lymph node dissections (RPLNDs), RPLND is also a good option, especially if the tumor is predominantly teratoma. (See <a href=\"#H40926150\" class=\"local\">'Low-risk disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men with high-risk disease, options include adjuvant chemotherapy with one cycle of BEP, active surveillance, or RPLND (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F114315\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114315 \">algorithm 1</a>). The specific choice should be based upon patient preference and should take into account the available expertise.
