Their venom causes painful local reactions and induces a high rate of allergic sensitization. Patients who become allergic to IFA venom can experience a range of reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis.</p><p>The term &quot;imported fire ant&quot; refers to two members of the <em>Solenopsis</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The red imported fire ant (RIFA), <em>Solenopsis invicta</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The black imported fire ant (BIFA), <em>Solenopsis richteri</em></p><p/><p>This topic review discusses the medical consequences of IFA stings and the treatment of IFA venom allergy.

The RIFA is found in 14 states (Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia) with limited territory in Arizona, Maryland, and Delaware [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Infestations also occur in Mexico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], as well as several Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, the British and United States Virgin Islands, Antigua, and Trinidad. In addition, RIFAs have been detected in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, and China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Black imported fire ants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The habitat of the black imported fire ant (BIFA) is relatively limited to a small area of northern Alabama, northern Mississippi, and southern Tennessee.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H496031\"><span class=\"h1\">APPEARANCE AND BEHAVIORS OF IMPORTED FIRE ANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worker ants vary in size from &#8539; to &frac14; inches (3 to 6 mm) long and are reddish-brown to black in color. They all have stingers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F73265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73265 \">figure 1</a>) and will attack anything that disturbs them. A single ant can deliver multiple stings.</p><p>Fire ants are difficult to avoid in endemic areas. Stings of imported fire ants (IFAs) can be sustained both outdoors and indoors. Available data suggest that 50 to 89 percent of people residing in an IFA-infested area will be stung each year. In one report, 51 percent of 107 previously unexposed subjects were stung within three weeks of arrival in an endemic area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Children are stung more often than adults. Patients in long-term care facilities are also at risk, as they may not be aware of their surroundings and may be immobilized by disease or otherwise unable to respond if they come into contact with ants.</p><p>When their nests are disturbed, IFAs swarm out and sting anything they encounter, including humans, pets, livestock, and wildlife [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Once foraging fire ants have made contact with a potential victim, a variety of stimuli, including simple movement of the patient, may trigger a stinging event, leading to multiple stings in a very short period of time.</p><p>Stings occur most frequently during summer, most commonly in children, and typically on the lower extremities. Off-season stings (eg, during winter months) often do not cause as much pain and may go unnoticed until the local reaction develops. This may reflect seasonal differences in IFA venom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H498148\" class=\"local\">'Protein allergens'</a> below.)</p><p>During a sting, the ant uses its powerful mandibles to hold onto the skin, arches its body, and injects venom through the stinger located at the tip of its abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56561\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56561 \">picture 1</a>). The ant will sting repeatedly if not quickly removed and often leaves a circular pattern of stings as it rotates its body. The human victim characteristically experiences an immediate, intense burning (the &quot;fire&quot; inspiring the name of the ant) and itching at the sting site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H500021\"><span class=\"h2\">Fire ant avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IFAs will not sting through fabric, stockings, or tights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, wearing shoes (not sandals) with socks and long pants are helpful avoidance measures. Hands and arms should be covered with gloves and sleeves when gardening or doing outdoor work. Available insect repellents are <strong>not</strong> effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. When a sting sensation is noted, the ant should be quickly killed with a slap to prevent multiple stings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498141\"><span class=\"h1\">VENOM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The venom of imported fire ants (IFAs) is approximately 95 percent water-insoluble alkaloids by volume, with the remaining 5 percent being an aqueous solution of proteins. This differs markedly from the venoms of yellow jackets, hornets, wasps, and bees, which are largely aqueous protein solutions. The alkaloids cause the sterile pustule but are not allergenic (see <a href=\"#H498170\" class=\"local\">'Venom alkaloids'</a> below). The allergenic portion of the venom is the protein component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H498148\" class=\"local\">'Protein allergens'</a> below.)</p><p>The volume of injectate positively correlates with body size in <em>S. invicta </em>(red imported fire ant [RIFA]). Direct measurements suggest that the venom volume delivered per sting from a <em>S. invicta</em> worker is approximately 0.66 nanoliters, containing 0.56 mcg of venom alkaloid and 10 to 100 nanograms of protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498148\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are seasonal variations in the protein content of the IFA venom, with higher protein levels in summer than at other times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. <em>S. invicta</em> venom has four dominant allergenic proteins: Sol i 1, Sol i 2, Sol i 3, and Sol i 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55585 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sol i 1, which has a molecular weight of 37 kD, comprises approximately 2 to 4 percent of venom allergen by weight and possesses both phospholipase A and B activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Some of the N-terminal sequences of Sol i 1 share sequences with the venom phospholipase of <em>Vespula maculifrons</em>, and sera from some patients with allergy to vespid venom contain immunoglobulin E (IgE), which binds to Sol i 1 by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) or immunoblot studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,13</a>]. The close structural similarity of portions of the Sol i 1 molecule to portions of vespid phospholipase may explain this immunologic cross-reactivity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Little is known about the clinical significance of the immunologic cross-reactivity between fire ant and vespid venom.

Its complementary DNA (cDNA) has been successfully cloned.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sol i 4 is a single chain 117-amino acid protein of molecular weight 13,340 and comprises between 8 and 10 percent of venom protein content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although it shares approximately 35 percent identity with Sol i 2, it lacks immunologic cross-reactivity. Sol i 2 and 4 are unrelated to any proteins found in venoms from other insect genera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p><em>S. richteri</em> (black imported fire ant [BIFA]) venom contains proteins designated as Sol r 1, 2, and 3, which are chemically and antigenically very similar to Sol i 1, 2, and 3. A protein corresponding to Sol i 4 has not been found in <em>S. richteri </em>venom (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55585 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498170\"><span class=\"h2\">Venom alkaloids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The alkaloids in IFA venom are toxic to human epithelium and induce a sterile pustule at the sting site. These compounds are alkaline 2-methyl-6-n-alkyl and alkenyl piperidines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15-17</a>] and are classified as solenopsins and dehydrosolenopsins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Venom alkaloids have hemolytic, cytotoxic, and antibacterial properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>].</p><p>RIFA workers produce the most complex and toxic venom alkaloids of any of the North American <em>Solenopsis</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The relative composition of fire ant venom alkaloids varies with the size and age of the individual worker ant, as well as between species and among castes within a species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/17,18,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,26</a>].</p><p>Venom alkaloids have various other properties, as shown in animal and human studies. These include activation of platelets, neutrophils, and the alternate complement pathway, histamine release from peritoneal mast cells, irreversible inhibition of neuromuscular transmission, and inhibition of nitric oxide synthase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/25,27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27-31</a>]. Direct convulsant, cardiotoxic, and respiratory depressant actions of two synthetic venom alkaloids, solenopsin A and isosolenopsin A, have been demonstrated in rodents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The data reviewed in the above section indicate that substantial pharmacologic activity is present in the alkaloid fraction of <em>S. invicta</em> venom. However, direct, nonallergic, toxic effects resulting from <em>S. invicta</em> envenomation in humans have not been reported. Although human systemic toxicity has not been convincingly demonstrated, the substantial pharmacologic activity of IFA venom alkaloids may underlie the poor clinical outcome seen in some cases of massive attacks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7806077\"><span class=\"h2\">Cross-reactivity with other Hymenoptera species</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cross-reactivity between antigens in IFA venom and antigens in the venoms of other Hymenoptera species is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/13,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,33</a>]. Thus, if a patient was able to identify an IFA as the insect which caused a reaction, there is no need to also evaluate the patient for allergy to other Hymenoptera species.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H499132\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical reactions to imported fire ant (IFA) stings can range from mild discomfort to life-threatening anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H499191\"><span class=\"h2\">Local reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local reactions are divided into three types: the wheal and flare reaction, the sterile pustule, and the large local reaction. By definition, local reactions involve signs and symptoms at or contiguous with the sting site.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wheal and flare</strong> &ndash; Nearly all individuals stung by IFAs develop hive-like lesions with surrounding erythema at the sting site. This reaction develops within 20 minutes and is accompanied by painful burning and then pruritus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56561\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56561 \">picture 1</a>). The burning sensation is characteristic and helps differentiate the stings of IFA from those of other insects. Symptoms are more pronounced during the summer months when the ants have more venom. The initial symptoms are followed in the succeeding 24 hours by development of the sterile pustule.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sterile pustule</strong> &ndash; A pustule filled with yellow fluid containing epithelial debris and few cells develops at the site of a sting within the first 24 hours. These pustules are sterile and caused by the venom alkaloids. The presence of these pustules with an appropriate history of a painful sting is relatively pathognomonic for the sting of the IFA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F76841\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76841 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F98662\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98662 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F98661\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98661 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F98660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98660 \">picture 5</a>). The pustule peaks in size at 24 hours and can last for one week or more. It is not necessary to culture these pustules unless the patient has scratched the site and denuded the pustules and there is concern about superinfection with skin flora. The epidermis overlying the pustule usually remains intact for 48 to 72 hours before it erodes, which generally allows sufficient time for new epidermis to cover the base of the lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Large local reaction</strong> &ndash; In individuals with venom-specific immunoglobulin E (V-IgE), large local reactions may develop at the sting site over 6 to 24 hours, simultaneously with the development of the sterile pustule. The pustule ultimately sits atop an area of intensely pruritic, painful inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56561\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56561 \">picture 1</a>). Although usually self-limited, swelling can be severe, and vascular compromise can occur in extremities. This topic will refer to severe large local reactions as &quot;extreme local reactions.&quot; Extensive and spreading edema can be a source of confusion in extreme local reactions. However, by definition, the swelling is contiguous with the site of the sting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Histopathologic studies have demonstrated that large local reactions are IgE-mediated, late cutaneous allergic reactions like those that can occur after stings of flying Hymenoptera. On histologic examination, the lesions are composed of a dense fibrin gel and a mixed cellular infiltrate of eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H499216\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic allergic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic allergic reactions may range from cutaneous (generalized urticaria, angioedema, pruritus, erythema) to life-threatening bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, or vascular collapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448 \">table 2</a>). Anaphylaxis may occur within minutes or may rarely develop hours after a sting. A single sting is sufficient to cause anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Pathognomonic pustules can later identify the fire ant as the culprit.</p><p>Reliable estimates for the incidence of fire ant anaphylaxis are not available, because anaphylaxis is not a reportable disease. Published studies have reported rates ranging from 0.6 to 16 percent of those stung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p>IFA stings represent a leading cause of anaphylaxis for populations residing in endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. One blinded survey of random adult blood donors in an IFA-endemic area demonstrated allergen-specific IgE to IFA if the reference population was 1.7 times more common than IgE for other allergens associated with fatal allergic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Anaphylactic reactions to IFA stings usually occur in individuals who have been stung at least once before without eliciting anaphylaxis. However, some subjects have had anaphylactic reactions in response to their first stings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Clinical and laboratory studies suggest that most of these subjects have been sensitized previously to <em>Vespula</em> (yellow jacket) venom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <em>Vespula</em> venom cross-reacts with <em>Solenopsis</em> venom in vitro. There is also evidence that the venom of the common striped scorpion, <em>Centruroides vittatus</em>, may be cross-reactive with IFA venom and that this may be responsible for reported episodes of anaphylaxis upon an initial scorpion sting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H499243\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions that have been associated with fire ant stings in humans include serum sickness, nephrotic syndrome, seizures, mononeuritis, and worsening of pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/34,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,43-45</a>]. The pathogenesis of these sequelae is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H499271\"><span class=\"h3\">Massive attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Massive attacks by foraging fire ants have been increasingly reported in the medical literature and the lay press [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. These attacks usually occur in the late summer months and frequently after it rains. Victims can be found in the early morning hours covered with ants. Massive attacks can occur indoors and generally affect debilitated or very young patients who cannot ward off the attack. Individuals can sustain hundreds to thousands of fire ant stings.</p><p>The reason for these massive attacks is unclear. Our group has hypothesized that IFA attacks on humans reflect normal foraging predatory behavior of the ants during periods of food scarcity, behavior that may reflect the increasing density of the ants in the environment. Examples of this behavior exist in the field. A Texas study reported 19 percent of cotton rats captured in traps in fire ant endemic areas were attacked by ants within a few hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Over one-half of the attacked rats were found dead or partially eaten.</p><p>It is unclear whether massive attacks can result in morbidity, secondary to relatively large doses of venom components. Such toxic reactions following 50 to 100 simultaneous stings by winged Hymenoptera species (bees, wasps, yellow jackets, and hornets) have been reported in humans, but equivalent reactions resulting from fire ant stings are not well-established. However, such reactions have been observed in small animals, such as dogs, rats, mice, and calves.</p><p>Variable clinical outcomes in humans occur after massive fire ant attacks.

That patient was in good general health except for Alzheimer disease and had no obvious untoward effects. In contrast, four of the six patients died within one week of the attack.

On rare occasions, pustules are absent.</p><p>The diagnosis of IFA venom allergy requires the demonstration of venom-specific IgE (V-IgE) by skin testing or in vitro tests, in combination with a consistent clinical history. As with all forms of allergy, the presence of V-IgE alone does <strong>not</strong> predict systemic reactivity. For this reason, subjects <strong>without</strong> a history of systemic reactions to IFA stings should not be tested for V-IgE, as there is a high rate of asymptomatic production of V-IgE in populations exposed to fire ants. In studies of skin test reactivity to IFAs, positive skin tests were seen in up to 30 to 40 percent of history-negative control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1,2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,5</a>]. Similarly, the level of V-IgE does not predict the severity of a sting reaction in those with systemic allergy, and patients with large local reactions may have equally high levels of V-IgE.</p><p>Skin testing is the preferred method of detecting V-IgE. Skin testing should only be performed by an allergy expert, both because of the skill required for interpretation and the potential risk of severe reactions in highly sensitive patients.

United States manufacturers have since agreed to verify the content of Sol i 2 and Sol i 3 in their products. Despite these measures, we recommend confirming the venom content in extracts by skin testing an individual known to be skin test-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In addition, 31 subjects underwent fire ant stings under direct observation, and none had anaphylactic reactions while receiving maintenance immunotherapy.

Such patients are not routinely treated with immunotherapy. However, it is not clear that children with these reactions in response to fire ant stings are similarly at low risk for anaphylaxis. Most allergists do not routinely recommend immunotherapy for such children in the absence of respiratory or vasomotor symptoms.

For this reason, we test each lot of IFA WBE by using it to skin test an individual with known reactivity to IFA, before the extract is used for skin testing and immunotherapy in other patients. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing'</a> above.)</p><p>The possibility that the IFA WBE used for immunotherapy contains minimal fire ant venom can be investigated by skin testing the patient with the extract in question at the concentration used for routine skin testing. If the patient has a negative result, then the problem is revealed. Under these circumstances, we recommend that IFA immunotherapy be reinitiated with an active extract. We prefer administering a new extract composed of two different lots of extracts known to induce positive skin test reactions in such a patient.</p><p>If the above approach fails, increasing the volume of the maintenance extract using two separate injections up to 0.5 mL of the maintenance concentration in two separate sites may be of benefit.</p><p>In patients with systemic reactions to IFA immunotherapy, in whom higher maintenance doses might pose a risk, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> has been reported to be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].

Treatment with large doses of glucocorticoids and intravenous fluids may complicate the management of those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Treatment with oral nonsedating antihistamines and topical corticosteroids appears to be adequate in most cases.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Territory'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fire ant stings produce an immediate, intense burning (the &quot;fire&quot; inspiring the name) and itching at the sting site. Stings occur most frequently during summer, most commonly in children, and typically on the lower extremities. (See <a href=\"#H499132\" class=\"local\">'Clinical reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most people develop only local reactions, which may take several forms, including wheal and flare reactions, sterile pustules, and large local reactions. Local reactions are contiguous with the sting site. (See <a href=\"#H499191\" class=\"local\">'Local reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of local reactions is symptomatic and not always necessary (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Management of local reactions'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with uncomfortable wheal and flare reactions, we suggest the application of low-potency topical corticosteroids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral antihistamines (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Large local reactions often require treatment with topical agents and oral antihistamines. High-potency topical corticosteroids may be required. For severe swelling, we suggest administration of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (60 mg given as a single dose) and elevation of the affected extremity (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some individuals develop systemic allergic reactions, which can range from cutaneous symptoms (generalized urticaria, angioedema, pruritus, erythema) to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis may occur within minutes after a sting or on rare occasions can develop hours after. The pathognomonic sterile pustules can later identify the fire ant as the culprit. (See <a href=\"#H499216\" class=\"local\">'Systemic allergic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with systemic allergic reactions must be treated emergently for anaphylaxis and equipped with an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector for self-treatment of possible future reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with allergic reactions should be referred to an allergy expert. The diagnosis of IFA venom allergy requires the demonstration of venom-specific immunoglobulin E (V-IgE) by skin testing or in vitro tests. Skin testing is the preferred method, but in vitro testing is available if the skin is compromised or if there is a medical contraindication to skin testing. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with confirmed IFA venom allergy, we recommend three to five years of venom immunotherapy with commercially available whole body IFA vaccines (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Various protocols have been established. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massive attacks, in which individuals sustain hundreds or thousands of stings, have been reported. Multiple stings can result in a variety of toxic reactions, such as serum sickness, nephrotic syndrome, seizures, mononeuritis, and worsening of pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease. Treatment should be individualized to the patient's symptoms, and we suggest <strong>against</strong> empirically administering large doses of glucocorticoids and intravenous fluids, particularly in debilitated patients and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For most patients with multiple stings, the interventions suggested for local reactions are sufficient. (See <a href=\"#H499243\" class=\"local\">'Toxic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lofgren CS, Banks WA, Glancey BM.
