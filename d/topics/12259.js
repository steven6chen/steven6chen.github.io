Ovarian cysts occur commonly in women of all ages. Some women with ovarian cysts have pain or pelvic pressure, while others have no symptoms. Irregular menstrual periods are not usually related to an ovarian cyst.</p><p>Fortunately, most ovarian cysts do not require surgical removal and are not caused by cancer. Cysts can vary in size from less than one centimeter (one-half inch) to greater than 10 centimeters (4 inches).</p><p>This topic discusses the various causes of ovarian cysts, how ovarian cysts are diagnosed, and what follow up testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment might be recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVARIAN CYST CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of ovarian cysts depend upon whether you are still having menstrual periods (premenopausal) or have stopped menstruating for at least one year (postmenopausal). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the adnexal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Premenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For premenopausal women, the most common causes of ovarian cysts include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovulation &ndash; &quot;Functional&quot; ovarian cysts develop when a follicle (sac) grows, but does not rupture to release the egg. These cysts usually resolve without treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermoid cysts &ndash; Dermoid cysts (teratomas) are one of the most common types of cysts found in women between age 20 and 40 years. A dermoid cyst is made up ovarian germ cells (germ cells are reproductive cells, eg, eggs) and can contain teeth, hair, or fat. Most dermoid cysts are benign, but rarely, they can be cancerous. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian germ cell tumors: Pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Mature teratoma (dermoid)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) &ndash; Women with PCOS may have many small cysts. These cysts do not need to be removed or treated with medication, but women with PCOS may need treatment for other PCOS problems, such as irregular menstrual periods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometriosis &ndash; Women with endometriosis can develop a type of ovarian cyst called an endometrioma, or &quot;chocolate cyst.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Endometriosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy &ndash; An ovarian cyst normally develops in early pregnancy, to help support the pregnancy until the placenta forms. In some cases, the cyst stays on the ovary until later in the pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe pelvic infections &ndash; Severe pelvic infections may spread to involve the ovaries and fallopian tubes. As a result, pus-filled cysts form close to the ovaries <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fallopian tubes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-cancerous growths</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer &ndash; Cancer is a relatively uncommon cause of ovarian cysts in premenopausal women; less than 1 percent of new growths on or near the ovary are related to ovarian cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Postmenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women who have stopped having menstrual periods, the most common causes of ovarian cysts include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-cancerous growths</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid collection in the ovary</p><p/><p>In postmenopausal women, new growths on or around the ovary are somewhat more likely to be caused by cancer than in premenopausal women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Do I have ovarian cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although ovarian cancer is not the most common cause of ovarian cysts, many women who are diagnosed with a cyst are concerned that they could have cancer. Ovarian cancer is more likely in women who have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A genetic predisposition to ovarian cancer (eg, family history of ovarian or related cancers)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A previous history of breast or gastrointestinal cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cyst that appears complex (a cyst with solid areas, nodule on the surface, or multiple fluid-filled areas)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fluid collection (called ascites) found in the pelvis or abdomen during the imaging test</p><p/><p>However, women without cancer may also have these characteristics. In most cases, further testing will be recommended to gauge the likelihood of cancer.</p><p>If your doctor is concerned that you could have ovarian cancer, he or she may recommend that you meet with a physician specialist, called a gynecologic oncologist. These physicians have been trained in the surgical treatment of ovarian cancer, and can improve your chances of survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-line-medical-treatment-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: First-line medical treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H925537\"><span class=\"h1\">OVARIAN CYST SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian cysts may be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. Women with symptoms from ovarian cysts typically experience pain or pressure in the lower abdomen on the side of the cyst. This pain may be dull or sharp; it may be constant or come and go. Crampy lower abdominal pain is not usually related to ovarian cysts. If an ovarian cyst ruptures, a woman may experience a sudden sharp pain, which may be severe. Women with torsion (twisting) of an ovary may feel pain along with nausea and vomiting. Abnormal periods or vaginal bleeding is not usually related to ovarian cysts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">OVARIAN CYST DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian cysts can sometimes be detected during a pelvic examination, although an imaging test, usually a pelvic ultrasound, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also sometimes used, but less commonly. These imaging tests can also provide information about the cyst's size, location, and other important characteristics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One or more blood tests may be recommended if you are found to have an ovarian cyst. The blood test(s) can help to determine the nature of the cyst.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy testing &ndash; A blood or urine pregnancy test is often performed in premenopausal women with an ovarian cyst. Ovarian cysts are common during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CA 125 &ndash; CA 125 is a blood test that is sometimes drawn in women with ovarian cysts. However, ovarian cancer cannot be diagnosed based upon the results of a CA 125 test. Many women with early ovarian cancer will have a normal CA 125 level. CA 125 is abnormally elevated in about 80 percent of women with advanced ovarian cancer.<br/><br/>Also, non-cancerous conditions can cause CA 125 to be elevated, including endometriosis, uterine fibroids, pelvic infections, heart failure, and liver and kidney disease. As a result, measurement of the CA 125 is not recommended in every case. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Ovarian cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CA 125 is often recommended for postmenopausal women with an ovarian cyst.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CA 125 may be recommended for premenopausal women whose ovarian cyst appears very large or suspicious for cancer on ultrasound.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CA 125 is not usually recommended for premenopausal women with ovarian cysts that are small and do not appear suspicious for cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other blood tests are also available for testing women with an ovarian cyst for ovarian cancer. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Next steps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending upon the results of the imaging test, your age, symptoms, results of blood tests, and your family history, your healthcare provider may recommend watchful waiting or surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OVARIAN CYST TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian cysts do not always require treatment. In premenopausal women, ovarian cysts often resolve on their own within one to two months, without treatment. In postmenopausal women, ovarian cysts are less likely to resolve.</p><p>If a cyst is large, causing pain, or appears suspicious for cancer, treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cyst or the entire ovary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Watchful waiting</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Premenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In premenopausal women, watchful waiting usually involves monitoring for symptoms (pelvic pain or pressure) and repeating the pelvic ultrasound after six to eight weeks. If the ovarian cyst does not enlarge or if it resolves during the period of watchful waiting, it does not usually require surgical removal. Some premenopausal women will be advised to take a birth control pill during this time to help prevent new ovarian cysts from developing.</p><p>If a cyst decreases in size or does not change, the ultrasound is often repeated at regular intervals until your healthcare provider is certain that the cyst is not growing. If the cyst resolves, no further testing or follow-up is required. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian cyst follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Postmenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In postmenopausal women, the decision to undergo watchful waiting depends upon the initial testing (ultrasound and CA 125). If the cyst does not appear to be cancerous, watchful waiting may be an option, and includes a pelvic ultrasound and measurement of CA 125 every three to six months for one year, or until the cyst resolves. However, ovarian cysts do not always resolve in postmenopausal women.</p><p>If the CA 125 levels increase or the cyst grows or changes in appearance, then surgery to remove the cyst may be recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery may be recommended in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cyst is causing persistent pain or pressure, or may rupture or twist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cyst appears on ultrasound to be caused by endometriosis and is removed for fertility reasons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large cysts (&gt;5 to 10 cm) are more likely to require surgical removal compared to smaller cysts. However, a large size does not predict whether a cyst is cancerous.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the cyst appears suspicious for cancer. If you have risk factors for ovarian cancer or the cyst looks potentially cancerous on imaging studies, your healthcare provider may recommend surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the suspicion for ovarian cancer is low but the cyst does not resolve after several ultrasounds, you may choose to have it removed after a discussion with your healthcare provider. However, surgical removal is not usually necessary in this case.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery to remove ovarian cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If surgery is needed to remove an ovarian cyst, the procedure is usually done in a hospital or surgical center. Whether the surgery involves removing only the cyst or the entire ovary depends upon your age and what is found during the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oophorectomy and ovarian cystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is suspicion of cancer, the whole ovary must be removed since cutting into a cancerous cyst may lead to cancer spread. In some cases, the whole ovary is removed and the cyst turns out to be benign. Having one ovary removed will not cause you to go through menopause and will not cause you to be infertile.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the cyst appears non-cancerous and is able to be removed through small incisions, it may be removed laparoscopically (through several small incisions) and you may be able to go home the same day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the cyst is large or appears suspicious for cancer, it may be necessary to have an open incision (called a laparotomy) and the surgeon may need to remove the entire ovary and surrounding tissues. You will need to stay in the hospital for one or more nights after a laparotomy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">OVARIAN CYST FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After an ovarian cyst resolves, you will not need further imaging tests if you do not have symptoms.</p><p>Some types of ovarian cysts are more likely to recur than others. This includes endometriomas and functional ovarian cysts. If you are premenopausal and are concerned about recurrent cysts, taking a birth control pill or other hormonal form of birth control may help to prevent ovarian cysts from developing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=8397\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
