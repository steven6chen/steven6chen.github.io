Placental sulfatase deficiency also is a rare cause of postterm pregnancy.</p><p/><p>It has been suggested that specific nutritional deficiencies, such as zinc, may predispose to altered pregnancy length, but systematic reviews of the available literature have not supported this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of postterm infants is based primarily on fetal growth. In most cases, continued fetal growth results in higher birth weights in the postterm than term infant, with an increased likelihood of macrosomia. However, fetal growth restriction (FGR) occurs in some postterm infants, most likely caused by a poorly functioning placenta that is unable to provide adequate nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. This results in the birth of a small for gestational age (SGA) infant, who usually appears malnourished. (See <a href=\"#H87974884\" class=\"local\">'Fetal growth restriction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87975035\"><span class=\"h2\">Macrosomia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infant size and birth weight (BW) are affected by extended gestational length. Most postterm infants are larger than term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], as both fetal BW and head circumference measurements continue to increase from 39 to 43 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a study from China, macrosomia (defined as a BW &gt;4000 g) was more likely in postterm infants (gestational age [GA] &ge;42 weeks) than in infants born at 40 weeks gestation (11 versus 9 percent, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95% CI 1.3-1.41) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>These infants appear normal at birth, apart from their large size. They often have accentuated physiologic desquamation of the skin, which peaks at approximately one week of age. Postterm macrosomic infants are at risk for birth injury due to prolonged labor, cephalopelvic disproportion, and shoulder dystocia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=large-for-gestational-age-newborn#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Large for gestational age newborn&quot;, section on 'Birth injury'</a> and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87974884\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal growth restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poor fetal growth is thought to be due to a degenerating or poorly functioning placenta that is unable to provide adequate nutrition and oxygenation. The risk of FGR increases as the pregnancy extends beyond 40 weeks gestation. As an example, in a population-based study of all deliveries that occurred in Sweden from 1987 to 1992, the incidence of FGR was 17, 20, 29, and 62 per 1000 pregnancies at gestational weeks 40, 41, 42, and &ge;43, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Fetal growth restriction is associated with increased perinatal mortality in postterm pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal mortality'</a> below.)</p><p>FGR in postterm pregnancy results in a long, thin, SGA malnourished infant with meconium staining, and dry and parchment-like peeling skin, referred to as dysmaturity syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/6,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,15</a>]. In these infants, the skin appears loose, especially over the thighs and buttocks, and has prominent creases. Vernix caseosa is decreased or absent. Lanugo hair is sparse or absent, while scalp hair is increased. The nails typically are long. The infants generally have the appearance of increased alertness and a &quot;wide-eyed&quot; look.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PERINATAL MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perinatal mortality (ie, stillbirths plus early neonatal deaths) increases as the pregnancy extends beyond 40 weeks gestation, as demonstrated by the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/2,13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,16,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the previously discussed population-based study from Sweden, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that intrauterine fetal death (stillbirth) rate rose with increasing gestational age (GA) beyond 40 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend of increased neonatal mortality with increasing GA above 40 weeks. The presence of fetal growth restriction (FGR) increased the risk of both fetal and neonatal mortality as GA increased beyond 40 weeks. The analysis adjusted for maternal age, parity, maternal smoking, and fetal gender. A large population-based cohort study confirmed the significance of growth restriction as the major mortality risk in these infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study from Norway, perinatal mortality was twofold greater in infants born at &ge;42 weeks gestation compared with term infants (relative risk [RR] 2.0, 95% CI 0.9-4.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of singleton liveborn infants without congenital anomalies in California from 1999 to 2003, infants born between 41 and &lt;43 weeks gestation had a higher mortality rate than those born between 38 and 40 weeks gestation (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.08-1.65) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The neonatal death rates were 2.46, 2.7, 2.54, 3.66, and 3.28 per 10,000 live births for infants born between 38 and &lt;39 weeks, 39 and &lt;40 weeks, 40 and &lt;41 weeks, 41 and &lt;42 weeks, and 42 and &lt;43 weeks, respectively.</p><p/><p>Fetoplacental insufficiency resulting in poor fetal growth, asphyxia (with and without meconium), and intrauterine infection are thought to contribute to the excess perinatal deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postterm-infant/abstract/13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20</a>].</p><p>Other concomitant factors along with prolonged pregnancy that have been reported to be associated with increased perinatal mortality include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primigravidity &ndash; In one study, stillbirth risk did not differ by parity prior to 41 weeks gestation.

Among postterm infants, the types of complications tend to depend on how fetal growth has been affected.</p><p>Fetal macrosomia is associated with prolonged labor, cephalopelvic disproportion, and shoulder dystocia resulting in an increased risk of orthopedic (eg, clavicular fractures) or neurologic birth injury (eg, brachial plexus palsy).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room&quot;, section on 'Anticipation of resuscitation need'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately after delivery, routine neonatal care is provided that includes drying, clearing the airway of secretions if present, maintaining warmth, and a rapid assessment of the infant's clinical status based on vigor, including cry, heart rate and tone, as well as an examination to identify any major congenital anomaly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The need for further intervention is based on this initial evaluation. If the infant does not require additional resuscitation, the infant should be given to the mother for skin-to-skin care and initiation of breastfeeding right after birth.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal management of postterm infants includes screening and treating complications associated with prolonged pregnancy and providing routine newborn care. (See <a href=\"#H87976449\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The long-term effects of prolonged pregnancies remain unknown. Limited data suggest individuals born postterm are at risk for neurodevelopmental complications (eg, cerebral palsy [CP]). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Long-term outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16463824\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Lori A Sielski, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Martin JA, Hamilton BE, Ventural SJ, et al.
