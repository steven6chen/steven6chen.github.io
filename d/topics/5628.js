It is the most frequent form of intellectual disability (mental retardation) caused by a microscopically demonstrable chromosomal aberration.</p><p>The Committee on Genetics of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has provided <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/128/2/393.full.pdf+html&amp;token=76MaZrwU0vZ3hxCWho4uRg4PLQuaBY0Yv9woFPVZ0Iu+qQUfGZexTCZDsOqX5sjOsQbgfU+80V7ZIbKVS2rbp8/JZTF62BMtzceAZpGWmJg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2938\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">recommendations</a> to assist clinicians in the care of children with DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The recommendations for medical evaluation are summarized in Appendix 1 of this document. Management requires an organized approach to the initial and ongoing evaluation and monitoring for associated abnormalities and prevention of common disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The management and life expectancy of children with DS is presented here. The epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis are discussed separately.

The 2015 DS-specific US growth charts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], which are consistent with the more contemporary charts based upon data from European populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/7,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,11</a>], will most likely supplant the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts for assessing growth and nutritional status in children with DS. The 2015 US charts include weight-for-length and corresponding body mass index (BMI) charts that are needed to adequately assess nutritional status, although optimal weight-for-length and BMI levels for individuals with DS are not yet established. One study showed that the CDC BMI growth chart using the 85<sup>th</sup> percentile was more sensitive for excess adiposity than the new DS-specific BMI chart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A goal of growth monitoring is the prevention of obesity. Interventions beginning at 24 months of age should include attention to diet and promotion of physical activity. Caloric intake should be less than recommended for age in typical individuals and supplemental vitamins and minerals should be provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Calcium and vitamin D intake should be monitored closely to minimize bone loss, since adults with DS have lower bone mineral density than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIAC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All newborns with Down syndrome (DS) should be evaluated for congenital heart disease in consultation with a pediatric cardiologist. An echocardiogram is recommended to detect abnormalities that may not be symptomatic or apparent on physical examination. Continued clinical cardiac evaluation is needed because of the high risk of mitral valve prolapse and aortic regurgitation in adolescents and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a large retrospective cohort study of congenital heart surgery, patients with DS had similar mortality, but higher morbidity, compared with patients without DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Infants with Down syndrome (DS) should have repeat hearing screening at six months of age. Hearing should be evaluated regularly throughout childhood, typically every six months until four to five years of age and then yearly. Any child who fails screening should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation and management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening the newborn for hearing loss&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing impairment in children: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-tests-in-children-and-adolescents#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening tests in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Hearing screen'</a>.)</p><p>Children should be evaluated and treated for otitis media, which occurs commonly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">OPHTHALMOLOGIC DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ophthalmologic assessment should be performed in the newborn period or at least before six months of age to detect strabismus, nystagmus, and cataracts. The risk of refractive errors is approximately 50 percent between three and five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Affected children should have annual assessments of vision. Unaffected children should be examined annually before age five years to detect refractive errors that may occur during childhood, and every two years after age five (every three years after age 13) to screen for disorders, including keratoconus and lens opacities, that may develop in adolescents or adults. The examination should be performed by a pediatric ophthalmologist or ophthalmologist with expertise in infants with disabilities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Visual development and vision assessment in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of strabismus in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nystagmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nystagmus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataract-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cataract in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROID FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid function testing (both total thyroxine [tT<sub>4</sub>] and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) should be obtained in the newborn period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that screening should be repeated at 6 and 12 months, and then annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, there is debate regarding the optimal frequency of laboratory screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Height and weight should be measured yearly since the combination of deceleration of linear growth associated with weight gain is a sensitive indicator of hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CELIAC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for symptoms of celiac disease should begin at one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Laboratory screening is recommended if signs or symptoms develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMATOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete blood count and differential should be obtained at birth to evaluate for myeloproliferative disorders and polycythemia. Infants with transient myeloproliferative disorders should be followed with a complete blood count and differential every three months until three years of age and then every six months until six years of age. This monitoring protocol is modified from that used in the prospective study of transient leukemia in Down syndrome (DS) conducted by the Pediatric Oncology Group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Children with DS are at increased risk for leukemia. Thus, there should be vigilance for signs of leukemia, such as anemia, increased infections, and excessive bruising. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Hematologic disorders'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-polycythemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal polycythemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the presentation and diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A hemoglobin level should be obtained annually from 1 to 13 years of age to screen for anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The anemia is usually due to iron deficiency secondary to the restricted diet that many children with DS develop as a result of delayed oral motor skills and dysphagia. However, anemia may also be a sign of leukemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIODONTAL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodontal disease is common in children and adults with Down syndrome (DS) and involves inflammation, periods of acute infection, and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The increased frequency is thought to be due in part to alterations in mouth flora, with a higher frequency of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Overlapping teeth, poor oral hygiene, and immunodeficiency may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-children-and-adolescents#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gingivitis and periodontitis in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Periodontitis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodontal disease in children: Associated systemic conditions&quot;, section on 'Down syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Routine brushing should be encouraged. Dental visits are recommended every six months. Orthodontic problems, which occur in the majority of DS patients, should be evaluated and treated if possible. However, the cooperation necessary for many orthodontic procedures may make them impractical in this population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ATLANTOAXIAL INSTABILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Genetics and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Sports Medicine and Fitness recommend careful neurologic evaluation for signs and symptoms consistent with spinal cord injury (eg, loss of motor skills, loss of bowel or bladder control, neck pain, neck stiffness) as the most important clinical predictor of symptomatic atlantoaxial instability (AAI) and dislocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/1,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26</a>]. The evaluating clinician should take a careful history and perform a thorough physical examination, looking for evidence of neurologic involvement. This clinical screening process should be done at least annually. Caution regarding contact sports and trampoline use should be discussed with families.</p><p>The AAP Committee on Genetics recommends obtaining lateral plain cervical spine radiographs in the neutral position with odontoid and anterior-posterior (A-P) views to examine for evidence of AAI or subluxation in patients with myelopathic signs or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Radiologic screening is also suggested in children with Down syndrome (DS) prior to procedures that require extremes of head position during induction of anesthesia or surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Of note, children do not have adequate vertebral mineralization and epiphyseal development for accurate radiographic evaluation of the cervical spine until at least three years of age.</p><p>The patient should be placed in a collar and referred immediately to a pediatric neurosurgeon or pediatric orthopedic surgeon if significant radiographic abnormalities are noted. Flexion and extension radiographs may be performed prior to referral if no significant radiographic abnormalities are present. The AAP Committee on Sports Medicine and Fitness recommends that symptomatic children have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to clarify the extent of spinal cord compression, and that appropriate surgical consultation be obtained to evaluate the need for definitive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Nearly all people with AAI who have suffered a catastrophic injury to the spinal cord have had preceding neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Asymptomatic AAI is more common than symptomatic AAI in patients with Down syndrome (DS), occurring in 14 versus 3 percent, respectively, in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Despite this, the Special Olympics requires screening neck radiographs in children with DS before participation. Children who are found to have AAI on these radiographs but who lack neurologic symptoms should be followed closely with repeat neurologic examinations (at least annually) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">BEHAVIOR AND PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment and treatment of behavior and psychiatric problems should be expeditious and should include evaluation of the problem at school and at home, behavior management techniques, and medication as needed.

Symptoms related to sleep apnea (snoring, restless sleep, and sleep position) should be discussed at health supervision visits beginning at age one year and continuing throughout childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Polysomnography or pulse oximetry monitoring during sleep is recommended in all children with DS by four years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A predictive model using questions from a validated sleep questionnaire, medication history, patient age, anthropometric measurements, vital signs, and physical exam findings had a negative predictive value of 73 percent for mild OSA and 90 percent for moderate to severe OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. If confirmed in validation studies, this tool could be used to determine which patients may not need a diagnostic sleep study.

However, the mean stretched penile length and the mean testicular volumes are significantly below average among adult men with DS compared with normal men. Fertility is impaired in individuals with DS, most likely secondary to primary gonadal deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Most published data, however, suggests that 15 to 30 percent of women with DS are capable of becoming pregnant and their risk of having a child with DS is about 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Offspring without trisomy 21 seem to have an increased risk for other congenital and developmental abnormalities. Limited research also suggests that women with DS may have an increased risk for miscarriages, premature births, and difficult labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Men with DS are generally thought to be infertile. However, there have been various published case reports of men with DS fathering children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>Individuals with various disabilities are at an increased risk for sexual abuse.

A medical evaluation should be performed, including testing for thyroid disease, when the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is considered. Possible depression should also be excluded. The diagnosis and treatment of dementia, including in patients with DS, is discussed in detail separately.

However, survival has improved substantially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. In a Swedish study using national birth and death registries, the median age at death increased from 3.6 years from 1969 to 1973 to 56.8 years from 1999 to 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The most common main or contributing cause of death was pneumonia and other infections, followed by congenital malformations, circulatory disease, and dementia. In a similar study using United States death certificates from 1983 to 1997, the improvement in survival was thought to be due to increased placement of infants in homes rather than institutions, and to changes in treatment for common causes of death, especially congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective cohort study conducted on 16,506 infants with DS born in the United States between 1983 and 2003, the overall 1-month and 1-, 5-, and 20-year survival probabilities were 98, 93, 91, and 88 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Survival improved modestly over the course of the study in all but the neonatal period.</p><p>In the study using death certificate data, malignancies other than leukemia were much less frequent in those with than without DS (standardized mortality odds ratio 0.07) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Possible mechanisms suggested for the low rate of cancer include tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 21, a slower rate of replication or higher rate of apoptosis in DS cells, or less exposure to environmental risks.</p><p>Predictors of survival in DS may include race, gender, birth weight, gestational age at birth, and presence of heart defects and other structural anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/37,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,41-43</a>]. In the death certificate study noted above, the median age at death was higher among whites than other races [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In contrast to the greater longevity of females in most populations, males with DS appear to have a survival advantage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. In a series from Western Australia, life expectancy was 58.6 years for the population, and 3.3 years longer for males than females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2067895\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC SCIENCE RESEARCH AND FUTURE TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of Down syndrome (DS) mouse models has provided an opportunity to study emerging pharmacotherapies that target intellectual disabilities common in DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. The overexpression of many genes found on chromosome 21 contributes to learning deficits. Research has focused on hippocampus function related to memory and learning. Areas of interest include specific gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor inhibitors, N-methyl-D-aspartic (NMDA) receptor antagonists, and hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis. Preliminary basic science research shows medications such as pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> may enhance learning in the DS mouse model. Further studies and clinical trials are needed to show efficacy and safety of these medications in children with DS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxidative stress, the imbalance between production and removal of oxygen-derived free radicals, may contribute to some features of Down syndrome (DS), such as decreased immune function, premature aging, impaired mental function, and malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In particular, the activity of superoxide dismutase (the gene for which is located on chromosome 21) is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Superoxide dismutase is usually regarded as a protective enzyme since it scavenges free superoxide molecules. However, in DS, the hydrogen peroxide generated by superoxide dismutase-1 may become toxic in the presence of ferrous iron (Fe2+). It forms the highly toxic hydroxyl radical (OH), which can result in profound cellular damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Supplementation with antioxidant nutrients has been proposed as potential therapy for DS. Treatments studied include supplementation with zinc, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a>, megavitamins and minerals, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a>, 5-hydroxytryptamine, coenzyme Q10, and targeted nutritional intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/49,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,52,53</a>]. These studies have methodologic flaws and provide no convincing evidence that nutritional supplementation improves outcomes in DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-management/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. One randomized controlled trial evaluated psychomotor and language development in 156 infants treated for 18 months with daily oral supplementation with one of four programs: antioxidants (selenium, zinc, vitamin A, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (folinic acid), antioxidants and leucovorin combined, or placebo.
