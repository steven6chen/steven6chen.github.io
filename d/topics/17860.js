Patients present with single or multiple inflammatory or sclerotic plaques. Disease activity typically persists for three to six years, although some patients develop more persistent or recurring episodes of activity. </p><p>The majority of adults with morphea are managed with observation, topical medications, or phototherapy. The level of disease activity, depth of involvement, body surface area involved, and the potential for functional impairment or cosmetic disfigurement determine the most appropriate approach to treatment. Aggressive systemic therapy is warranted for patients with active deep morphea or with lesions that are likely to cause significant cosmetic disfigurement, joint contractures, or other functional impairment. Occupational and physical therapy are additional important interventions for patients who have or are at risk for physical limitations.</p><p>Pharmacologic therapy, phototherapy, and other interventions for morphea in adults will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea and the features and management of morphea in children are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localized-scleroderma-in-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localized scleroderma in childhood&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20781863\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of treatment options are available for patients with active lesions of morphea; however, evidence in support of many of these therapies is limited. An algorithm for the treatment of patients with morphea is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63834\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63834 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>The expected outcome of successful therapy for morphea is not the return to completely normal skin, although this may occur in very early inflammatory lesions. Therapeutic success for individual lesions is defined by improvement or resolution of erythema, lesion softening, or local hair regrowth. In patients with progressive disease, successful treatment arrests the formation of new lesions and limits disease spread. We have found that serial photographs are valuable for following the response to therapy.</p><p>In general, active disease (present &lt;3 months or with clinical signs of inflammation) is most responsive to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sclerotic lesions are less likely to improve, and atrophic lesions rarely respond to therapy. </p><p>Given the self-limited nature of morphea, therapeutic intervention is optional for patients with uncomplicated, circumscribed morphea. The most important intervention in the management of these patients is close follow-up for the development of more extensive involvement that requires a more aggressive approach to therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults#H16539070\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults&quot;, section on 'Circumscribed (plaque) morphea'</a>.) </p><p>For patients with uncomplicated circumscribed morphea who desire treatment, topical therapies (eg, high potency topical corticosteroids, topical vitamin D, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) are often used as initial treatments despite the paucity of studies to support their efficacy. There is more evidence for the efficacy of phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>], which also can be used as first-line therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63834\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63834 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>A different approach to treatment is indicated for patients with more severe disease. In patients with generalized morphea, topical therapy is often ineffective. Phototherapy and systemic therapy are the preferred initial treatments for these patients. Progressive, deep morphea can result in functional impairments and should be treated aggressively with systemic agents. Phototherapy is not an option for patients with deep morphea due to the poor ability of ultraviolet light to penetrate deep tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63834\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63834 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>The best approach to systemic treatment of adult-onset morphea has not been established. In general, we treat patients with inflammatory, rapidly progressive morphea (defined as rapid evolution to involve multiple body sites or rapid extension of lesions over multiple joints within less than six months) simultaneously with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and a systemic glucocorticoid (eg, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>), and reserve monotherapy with methotrexate for those patients with less inflammatory and more slowly progressing disease and patients with contraindications to glucocorticoid therapy. Patients with superficial morphea who fail to improve with phototherapy may also be candidates for systemic treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63834\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63834 \">algorithm 1</a>). However, the risks and benefits of treatment must be considered carefully. Systemic therapy is not warranted in patients with nonthreatening, limited disease.</p><p>Local therapies, phototherapy, and systemic therapies are unlikely to be effective in patients with inactive disease. Treatment should focus on improving functional impairment through physical and occupational therapy and consultations with specialties such as orthotics, orthopedics, podiatry, and rheumatology as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63834\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63834 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>In patients with inactive disease but persistent cosmetic disfigurement, injectable cosmetic fillers or surgical intervention may lead to improvement. Surgical intervention is sometimes necessary for patients with persistent, disabling contractures. It is worth noting that we have observed the occurrence of new-onset or worsening morphea in sites of surgical incisions or radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Therefore, elective invasive procedures should be undertaken with caution, and should only be attempted in patients with inactive (atrophic stage) disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20781870\"><span class=\"h1\">TOPICAL AND INTRALESIONAL THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the relative safety of these agents, topical or intralesional medications are often used as first-line therapies for patients with limited, superficial (dermal) disease. Topical therapies are unlikely to be effective for disease involving the subcutis or deeper tissues, and are not useful for preventing the development of new lesions in patients with rapidly progressive disease. We typically utilize topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> 0.1% ointment under occlusion or intralesional corticosteroids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20781877\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical tacrolimus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> 0.1% ointment may be effective for active, inflammatory morphea. In an intraindividual randomized trial of 10 adults with active circumscribed morphea, one lesion on each patient was treated with tacrolimus ointment and a second lesion with petrolatum, both given twice daily for 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Significantly greater improvement occurred in lesions treated with tacrolimus. Open label studies and a case report also support the use of topical tacrolimus in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20781884\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical and intralesional corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although high potency topical corticosteroids are widely used by clinicians, including ourselves, for the treatment of morphea, no formal studies have documented efficacy. Topical corticosteroids are usually applied twice daily or once daily with occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>). If there is no response after 10 to 12 weeks, treatment should be discontinued.</p><p>Similarly, there are no formal studies of the efficacy of intralesional corticosteroids for morphea. However, in our clinical experience, intralesional corticosteroids injections have been effective for the treatment of circumscribed morphea or as adjuvant therapy for recalcitrant lesions in patients receiving phototherapy or systemic treatment. We find that corticosteroid injections appear to abrogate inflammation when injected to the periphery of an active lesion and soften sclerotic plaques. We typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide at a concentration of 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span>. In patients who respond to treatment, we repeat injections every four to six weeks until sufficient improvement is attained.

In a three-month open-label study, 12 adolescents and adults with morphea that had failed to respond to topical corticosteroids were treated with twice-daily application of topical calcipotriene 0.005% ointment under occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Successful treatment with imiquimod 5% cream has also been documented in a case report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The author has not had significant success with this therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20781905\"><span class=\"h1\">PHOTOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultraviolet (UV) light therapy has been used for the treatment of a variety of sclerotic diseases of the skin, including morphea. Because longer wavelengths of light are capable of greater depth of penetration into the skin, most studies of UV phototherapy in sclerotic skin disease have focused on the use of ultraviolet A (UVA) light (320 to 400 nm). Less data are available on the use of ultraviolet B (UVB) (290 to 320 nm).</p><p>UVA1 is a newer form of UVA phototherapy that eliminates the shorter, less deeply penetrating wavelengths of UVA light and emits only UVA radiation between 340 and 400 nm. This results in a lower risk of sunburn compared with broadband UVA. However, the availability of UVA1 treatment units remains limited. UVA1 is primarily administered in academic centers.</p><p>Phototherapy is unlikely to be effective for morphea with deep involvement (subcutis, fascia, or muscle) and should not be considered as primary therapy in such cases.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mechanism of action </strong>&ndash; The mechanisms through which UV light improves sclerotic skin disease are not fully understood. Theories for the efficacy of UVA light have included UV-induced upregulation of fibroblast production of enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases) that stimulate collagen breakdown as well as UV-induced immunomodulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The following observations support these theories: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exposure of fibroblasts to UVA1 increases fibroblast production of collagenase, and collagenase has been detected at increased levels in lesions of morphea irradiated with UVA1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IL-6, a cytokine that stimulates collagen production in fibroblasts, and IL-8, a proinflammatory cytokine, have been detected at increased levels in patients with morphea and are decreased following exposure to UVA1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>UVA may increase production of IFN-gamma, a cytokine that inhibits collagen synthesis, and may decrease production of the profibrotic cytokine TGF-beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>UVA1 stimulates the inhibition of transcription proteins (SMADs) that are involved in TGF-beta signal transduction in fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash; Multiple studies have investigated the efficacy of UV light for morphea. Benefit from psoralen plus UVA (PUVA), broadband UVA, UVA1, and narrowband UVB has been reported. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">PUVA was the first form of phototherapy used for morphea. PUVA was effective in a small uncontrolled study and case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/5,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) photochemotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Broadband UVA without psoralens is easier to administer than PUVA and has also shown efficacy. In a series of 12 patients with morphea treated with broadband UVA (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span> three times per week for 20 sessions, all patients exhibited lesion softening. Early lesions responded best to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One randomized trial and small, open-label studies and case reports have documented improvement with UVA1 phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. UVA1 permits the delivery of higher doses of UVA light with a lower risk of sunburn than occurs with similar doses of broad band UVA. However, no studies have directly compared the efficacies of broadband UVA and UVA1 for morphea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The comparative efficacy of some forms of phototherapy was evaluated in a randomized trial in which 64 patients were treated with low dose UVA1 (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup>),</span> medium dose UVA1 (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup>),</span> or narrowband UVB five times per week for eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. All patients improved with treatment. Medium dose UVA1 was significantly more effective than narrowband UVB. However, no significant differences in clinical efficacy were detected between medium and low dose UVA1 or between narrowband UVB and low dose UVA1. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;UVB therapy (broadband and narrowband)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Aside from this randomized trial, there are little other data on the efficacy of narrowband UVB for morphea. In a case report of two sisters with en coup de sabre, narrowband UVB slowed disease progression and reversed hair loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Advantages of narrowband UVB include its wide availability and ease of administration. In comparison, the time required to administer doses of UVA1 is much longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Choice and administration </strong>&ndash; In general, when UVA1 is available, we favor this modality for the treatment of morphea. However, when UVA1 is unavailable or impractical, we consider treatment with broadband UVA or narrowband UVB. Due to the lesser depth of penetration of UVB, we usually reserve narrowband UVB for patients with lesions that primarily involve the upper dermis. Improvement, defined as discontinuation of disease progression and reduction in erythema, usually occurs within 10 to 20 treatments with UV light. Most trials do not extend beyond 20 to 40 treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimum dose (low versus medium versus high) and regimen for UVA1 phototherapy have yet to be determined. We treat most patients with a medium (40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span> to high (90 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span> dose regimen, with treatments administered three to five times per week for a total of around 40 treatments. The patient&rsquo;s minimal dose to elicit erythema (minimal erythema dose) determines appropriate dosing for broadband UVA and narrowband UVB. Treatments are usually administered three times per week. The dose is escalated in a manner similar to dose escalation protocols for the treatment of psoriasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband#H10844520\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;UVB therapy (broadband and narrowband)&quot;, section on 'Dosimetry and treatment protocols'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Symptoms may recur following successful phototherapy and continued follow-up is necessary after completion of treatment. In a series of 37 adults and children with morphea who responded to UVA1 phototherapy and were followed for at least six months after completing treatment, 17 (46 percent) developed recurrences of active disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The two-year and three-year recurrence rates were 44.5 percent (95% CI 30.1-62.2 percent) and 48.4 percent (95% CI 33.2-66.1 percent), respectively. A longer duration of disease prior to treatment was associated with a slightly increased risk for recurrence of active disease (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.27). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adverse effects </strong>&ndash; Adverse effects of phototherapy include erythema, pruritus, hyperpigmentation, burns, and reactivation of herpes simplex virus infection.

In a 24-week open label study of nine adults with generalized morphea, treatment with oral methotrexate (15 to 25 mg per week) led to statistically significant improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, three patients discontinued the study due to adverse effects, and two patients required dose reductions due to side effects. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> relapse after the discontinuation of therapy, indicating that therapy likely has a suppressive, rather than curative effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Patients who relapse may respond to additional treatment courses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> is usually given orally or subcutaneously at a dose of 15 to 25 mg per week. Systemic glucocorticoids, when given, are started simultaneously with methotrexate. We typically give intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for three consecutive days per month) or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimum duration of therapy has not been determined, but patients are often treated for one to two years. We usually begin to taper <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> after 6 to 12 months of documented inactivity as assessed by clinical evaluation and serial photographs. We attempt to taper the dose of methotrexate by 2.5 mg every two to four weeks. For patients receiving intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, we discontinue infusions after three to four months. For patients receiving oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, we slowly taper the dose of prednisone with a goal of discontinuing treatment within three to four months. It is important to note that systemic glucocorticoids may be discontinued when signs of disease activity have resolved but the lesion is still sclerotic. Generally, softening continues while the patient is on methotrexate over 6 to 12 months. In our experience, it is unusual for a patient with morphea to require continued treatment with systemic glucocorticoids for more than four months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, data are insufficient to determine the optimal route, dose, and duration of these treatments in adults with morphea and practice varies widely. In an attempt to aid in the future development of clinical guidelines for juvenile morphea, a consensus-based standardized treatment plan for juvenile morphea has been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A similar step has not yet been taken for adult-onset disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Improvement with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> or methotrexate plus glucocorticoids is usually noted within two to five months and is most likely to occur in patients with early disease. In our experience, improvement occurs most rapidly in inflammatory lesions; sclerosis improves more slowly. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adverse effects </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and systemic glucocorticoids are reviewed elsewhere.

The disorder occurs in both adults and children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults#H16539049\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the self-limited nature of morphea, some patients with limited plaque disease may elect to defer therapy. For patients with superficial (dermal) circumscribed disease who desire treatment, but do not have access to or prefer to avoid the frequent visits required for phototherapy, we suggest treatment with high potency topical corticosteroids, intralesional corticosteroids, a topical vitamin D analog, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63834\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63834 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We typically use topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment under occlusion or intralesional corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"#H20781870\" class=\"local\">'Topical and intralesional therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with superficial (dermal) forms of morphea who are able and willing to receive phototherapy, we suggest treatment with UVA1 (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If UVA1 is not available, other options for phototherapy include broad band UVA, narrow band UVB, and PUVA. Phototherapy is unlikely to be effective for morphea involving the subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or bone. (See <a href=\"#H20781905\" class=\"local\">'Phototherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly progressive, severe, disabling disease requires treatment with systemic therapy. For patients in this category, we suggest treatment with a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and systemic glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
