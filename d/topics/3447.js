Each group of muscles in the body is surrounded by a strong band of tissue called &quot;fascia.&quot; In CECS, too much pressure builds up in a muscle compartment. This causes symptoms.</p><p>CECS can happen in people who exercise, especially runners. CECS usually affects a muscle compartment in the lower leg (calf).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30157536\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of chronic compartment syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CECS causes muscle pain with exercise. The pain is usually in both legs and starts within 20 to 30 minutes of exercising. The pain can feel like an ache, squeeze, cramp, or tight muscle. The pain goes away with rest, usually within 15 to 30 minutes after stopping the exercise.</p><p>Besides pain, CECS can also cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness or tingling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle weakness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30157551\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to prevent these symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are different things you can try to prevent these symptoms when you exercise. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Run on a softer surface.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear cushioned shoe inserts in your sneakers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Run less or not at all and do other kinds of exercise (such as swimming or biking) instead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice the painful area right after you exercise. Try to put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the area within the first hour after exercising. Then repeat this every 4 to 6 hours, for 15 minutes each time, if the area still feels tight or painful.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30157566\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you try the tips above but still have symptoms when you exercise, see your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30157581\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for chronic compartment syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam.</p><p>The only way your doctor can tell for sure if you have CECS is to do a test that measures your compartment pressure. Doctors can use different devices to measure compartment pressure. But in general, the test involves putting a thin needle or tube into your muscle. Your doctor will measure your compartment pressure before and after you exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30157596\"><span class=\"h1\">How is chronic compartment syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One option for treatment is to simply stop the activity that causes CECS. Another option is surgery. Doctors can do 2 different types of surgery to treat CECS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fasciotomy &ndash; This involves cutting open the fascia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fasciectomy &ndash; This involves removing pieces of fascia.</p><p/><p>Both of these surgeries help prevent too much pressure from building up again in the compartment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30157611\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
