Antibodies are proteins that are made as part of an immune response. Normally, the immune system responds to an infection by producing large numbers of antibodies to fight bacteria or viruses. However, when a person has an autoimmune disease, the immune system malfunctions and may produce large amounts of potentially harmful antibodies directed against one's own body. These self-directed antibodies are referred to as autoantibodies. Autoantibody-mediated inflammation and cell destruction may affect blood cells, skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, nervous system, and other organs of the body.</p><p>The ANA test identifies autoantibodies that target substances contained inside cells. Although the name implies that the test detects only autoantibodies directed against components of the nucleus, the test can also be used to detect antibodies directed against cellular components that are contained within the cell cytoplasm, outside of the nucleus.</p><p>Because symptoms of autoimmune disorders often vary from patient to patient, these diseases may be very difficult to diagnose. Together with a health care provider's careful consideration of a patient's symptoms, physical findings, and other laboratory test results, a positive ANA test may assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25516672\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETING ANTINUCLEAR ANTIBODIES RESULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the antinuclear antibody (ANA) test, antinuclear (or anti-cytoplasmic) antibodies bind to cells that have been fixed on a slide. The addition of a secondary antibody (with an attached fluorescent dye) directed against human antibodies may reveal staining of the nucleus or cytoplasm under a fluorescence microscope. Patient samples are often screened for ANA after being diluted 1:40 and 1:160 in a buffered solution. If staining is observed at both the 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions, then the laboratory continues to dilute the sample until staining can no longer be seen under the microscope. The level to which a patient's sample can be diluted and still produce recognizable staining is known as the ANA &quot;titer.&quot; The ANA titer is a measure of the amount of ANA in the blood; the higher the titer, the more autoantibodies are present in the sample.</p><p>It is difficult to standardize the ANA test between laboratories. One approach has been to modify the test reagents such that 30 percent of normal individuals will have a positive test when their sample is tested at a dilution of 1:40. This standardization makes the ANA test very <strong>sensitive</strong><em> </em>for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases but results in many false positive results. At a dilution of 1:160, only 5 percent of normal individuals have a positive test for ANA. The 1:160 dilution increases the <strong>specificity</strong> of the ANA test for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTINUCLEAR ANTIBODIES TESTING</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive test for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) may assist health care providers in establishing the diagnosis of an autoimmune disease and may help determine the specific type of autoimmune disease that is affecting a patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A negative test for ANA may assist health care providers by decreasing the likelihood that a patient's symptoms are caused by an autoimmune disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ANTINUCLEAR ANTIBODIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with the following systemic autoimmune diseases may have a positive test for antinuclear antibodies (ANA):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scleroderma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sjogrens-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed connective tissue disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug-induced lupus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Polymyositis/dermatomyositis</span> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyositis-dermatomyositis-and-other-forms-of-idiopathic-inflammatory-myopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and other forms of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid arthritis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oligoarticular juvenile chronic arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyarteritis nodosum</p><p/><p>Patients with organ-specific autoimmune diseases may also have a positive test for ANA.

Some examples are provided below:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25516715\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic lupus erythematosus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a diagnosis of SLE is suspected, then additional tests, looking for autoantibodies directed against double-stranded DNA, Sm antigens, and ribosomal P antigens may be ordered. Because these antibodies are relatively specific for SLE, the results may provide important clues to facilitate the diagnosis of SLE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25517001\"><span class=\"h2\">Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a diagnosis of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome is suspected, the health care provider may test for autoantibodies directed against antigens known as <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/SSA</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">La/SSB</span>. The presence of these autoantibodies provides support for the diagnosis of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, a disorder which involves autoimmune destruction of the glands that produce tears and saliva.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25517009\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a diagnosis of drug-induced SLE is suspected, then a test for antihistone antibodies may be ordered. Antihistone antibodies are nearly always present in patients with drug-induced SLE. If antihistone antibodies are not detected, then the likelihood of this diagnosis (drug-induced SLE) is greatly reduced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25517016\"><span class=\"h1\">A WORD OF CAUTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive test for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) does not, by itself, indicate the presence of an autoimmune disease. As mentioned above, because of the design of the ANA test, many normal individuals will have a positive test at low titers. Even when detected at high titer, a positive ANA result, by itself (in the absence of symptoms or physical findings), does not indicate that a patient either has, or will develop, an autoimmune disease. Some ANA appear to be unrelated to the development of autoimmune disorders. Future studies may help identify these &quot;benign&quot; autoantibodies and may permit health care providers to provide reassurance to their patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=574\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
