A high degree of understanding of cross-sectional anatomy of the pancreaticobiliary tract is required to attain competence in this area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-normal-pancreaticobiliary-anatomy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) provides high resolution images of the pancreatic duct as well as the parenchyma, and complements the ductal images seen in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). </p><p>This topic review will discuss normal pancreaticobiliary anatomy using radial scanning endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). The role of EUS in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis, pancreatic cancer, and chronic pancreatitis is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-patients-with-suspected-choledocholithiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in patients with suspected choledocholithiasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-the-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in the staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EUS examination resembles standard endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The operator performs the procedure while the patient is in left lateral decubitus position. Echoendoscopes are usually side-viewing and have an ultrasound transducer located at its tip that emits high frequency acoustic waves to the surrounding tissues. The latter permits the acquisition of unique &quot;real-time&quot; views of the gut wall and the surrounding organs and blood vessels.</p><p>Radial scanning EUS uses a scanning plane perpendicular to the axis of the echoendoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62721\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62721 \">figure 1</a>). The image is similar to that of computed tomography (CT) scan; if the patient is supine, the view is up from the feet. As a general rule, the upper part of the screen is anterior, and the right part of the screen is to the patient's left side. EUS depends upon a thorough knowledge of structures visualized in relation to the various transducer positions in the gastrointestinal tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69569 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>EUS examination of the pancreaticobiliary tract can be performed by using one of two approaches: starting with transgastric sonographic views and then proceeding transduodenally, or vice versa. The transgastric approach provides images of the pancreatic body and tail, whereas the transduodenal approach allows imaging of the pancreatic head. It is important to understand that normal pancreaticobiliary anatomy with either of these approaches can be variable and is by no means exactly reproducible in every patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSGASTRIC IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transgastric approach involves wedging the tip of the echoendoscope in the antrum and gradually pulling it back toward the body of the stomach using subtle movements. From the antrum, the gallbladder may come into view as an anechoic structure with a three-layered wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51586\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51586 \">image 1</a>). The gallbladder may also be viewed from the first and second portions of the duodenum. Gallbladder stones appear as round hyperechoic structures that cause posterior shadowing.</p><p>The confluence of the splenic vein and the portal vein is seen as the transducer is pulled back from the antrum; it is also referred to as the &quot;club head&quot; because of its resemblance to a golf club (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69269\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69269 \">image 2</a>). Posterior to the confluence is the cross section of the superior mesenteric artery, with hyperechoic walls.</p><p>The splenic vein is an important landmark to identify the body of the pancreas. The pancreas is located between the splenic vein and the transducer. The neck and body of the pancreas and glimpses of the pancreatic duct can be seen anterior to the splenic vein. The pancreas has a grainy &quot;salt and pepper&quot; pattern that appears more hyperechoic than the liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80886\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80886 \">image 3</a>).</p><p>Further visualization of the body of the pancreas can be achieved by slowly pulling the transducer into the gastric body. The pancreatic duct appears anechoic and in cross-section measures approximately 2 mm in the pancreatic body. Based upon our experience and the experience of other endosonographers, the diameter of the pancreatic duct approximately follows the 3-2-1 rule (ie, 3 mm in the head, 2 mm in the body, and 1 mm in the tail of the pancreas).</p><p>Another vascular structure that may be examined is the splenic artery. The splenic artery can be distinguished from the splenic vein because it is tortuous and may not be seen in a single plane; by contrast, the splenic vein appears as a long continuous structure. Following these vessels to the patient's left side leads to the hilum of the spleen, which marks the leftward limit of the tail of the pancreas. Further withdrawal of the scope toward the fundus will show the celiac trunk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55352\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55352 \">image 4</a>) bifurcating into the hepatic artery and the splenic artery (the whale's tail sign).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSDUODENAL IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transduodenal sonographic imaging is performed by wedging the tip of the echoendoscope into the apex of the duodenal bulb. The balloon of the echoendoscope is inflated and the shaft of the echoendoscope is placed along the greater curvature of the stomach (the long position). This obtains a longitudinal view of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct converging into the ampulla (surrounded by the pancreatic head) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62822\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62822 \">image 5</a>). This view can also be achieved from the duodenal bulb or by slowly advancing the tip of the echoendoscope beyond the duodenal bulb into the second portion of the duodenum. Obtaining this view is important for excluding an obstructive process (eg, tumor) in the <span class=\"nowrap\">periampullary/pancreatic</span> head area. Another landmark in this area is the &quot;stack sign,&quot; an image configuration that shows the common bile duct, pancreatic duct, and the portal vein almost parallel to each other.</p><p>The tip of the echoendoscope is deflected upward as it passes beyond the major ampulla, much like the technique in ERCP. The echoendoscope is then gradually withdrawn with subtle left and right tip deflection. Reference points in the third part of the duodenum are the inferior vena cava and aorta, which may be seen in cross-sectional and longitudinal views, depending upon the orientation of the tip of the echoendoscope. The uncinate process of the pancreas may be seen between the transducer and the aorta. At the level of the uncinate process, the ventral anlage of the pancreas comes into view in up to 75 percent of normal subjects. This triangular area represents the embryologic ventral bud of the pancreas that later forms the posterior and inferior aspect of the head of the pancreas. Because it appears hypoechoic (due to reduced fat content compared with the dorsal pancreas), it may be mistaken for a malignant tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">AGE-RELATED CHANGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal aging can be associated with endosonographic changes in the pancreas. An illustrative study included 120 patients without known pancreatic disease who agreed to undergo EUS during endoscopic evaluation for non hepatobiliary indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-normal-pancreaticobiliary-anatomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At least one parenchymal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ductular abnormality was identified in 28 percent of patients, with a trend of increasing abnormality with age. The most common finding was hyperechoic stranding. Abnormalities were more common in men. Other studies have also shown a strong trend toward increasing duct diameter with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-normal-pancreaticobiliary-anatomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These considerations are particularly important when using EUS in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H148591716\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-SURGICAL IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radial EUS imaging of the entire pancreas can be challenging in patients who have undergone upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, as normal landmarks have been lost or post-surgical inflammation and staples may cause artifacts. Data on the safety and feasibility of EUS imaging in patients with surgically altered anatomy are limited. In a retrospective study of 188 patients who had upper GI surgery, EUS examination was generally successful, except in patients who had undergone Roux-en-Y surgery where the inability to reach the proximal duodenum precluded imaging of the head of the pancreas and common bile duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-normal-pancreaticobiliary-anatomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. EUS examination was successful in patients who had undergone Billroth II surgery as long as the afferent limb was intubated. The authors recommended performing an EGD prior to EUS to better define the anatomy and rule out strictures or a long Roux limb. Although EUS with altered anatomy may be generally successful, if a suspected lesion is not found on EUS, the possibility that the lesion is present but not being seen (false negative result) due to anatomic issues should be kept in mind.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145486538\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAINING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal models have been proposed to demonstrate pancreaticobiliary anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-normal-pancreaticobiliary-anatomy/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].
