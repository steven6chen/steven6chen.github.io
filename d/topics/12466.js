Numerous factors, in addition to directly related medical complications, contribute to the impact of diabetes on quality of life and economics. Diabetes is associated with a high prevalence of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and adversely impacts employment, absenteeism, and work productivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>This review will provide an overview of the medical care for patients with diabetes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63002\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63002 \">table 1</a>).

A history and physical exam should be performed two to three times yearly to obtain information on nutrition, physical activity, management of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, and diabetes-related complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63002\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63002 \">table 1</a>). We check blood pressure and visually inspect the feet at every visit and, in addition, perform a more thorough foot examination and refer patients for a dilated eye exam annually. We measure A1C every three months if A1C is not in the goal range and therapy requires adjustment and every six months in patients with stable glycemic control who are meeting A1C goals. We measure fasting lipids and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio annually.</p><p>Morbidity from diabetes is a consequence of both macrovascular disease (atherosclerosis) and microvascular disease (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy). In type 2 diabetes, disease onset is insidious, and diagnosis is often delayed. As a result, diabetic complications may be present at the time of diagnosis of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and their frequency increases over time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58736\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58736 \">figure 1</a>). Once present, the progression of these complications can be slowed with interventions such as aggressive management of glycemia, blood pressure, and lipids; laser therapy for advanced retinopathy; and administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for nephropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Prevention and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These interventions appear to be reducing the incidence of several diabetes-related complications, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, lower-extremity amputation, and end-stage renal disease. In the United States, the greatest absolute declines have been reported for acute MI and stroke (between 1990 and 2010, 95.6 and 58.9 fewer cases per 10,000 persons per year for MI and stroke, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

For those with severe NPDR or proliferative diabetic retinopathy, the prevalence was 48 percent.

A comprehensive foot examination should be performed annually on patients with diabetes to identify risk factors predictive of ulcers and amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. Foot problems due to vascular and neurologic disease are a common and important source of morbidity in diabetic patients. Systematic screening examinations for neuropathic and vascular involvement of the lower extremities and careful inspection of feet may substantially reduce morbidity from foot problems.

Screening for increased urinary albumin excretion can be deferred for five years after the onset of disease in patients with type 1 diabetes because increased albumin excretion is uncommon before this time; screening should begin at diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes because many have had diabetes for several years before diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Abnormal results should be repeated at least two or three times over a three- to six-month period because of the large number of false positives that can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Establishing the diagnosis of increased urinary albumin excretion requires the demonstration of a persistent (at least two abnormal tests) elevation in albumin excretion. Fever, exercise, heart failure, and poor glycemic control are among the factors that can cause transient microalbuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Increased urinary protein excretion is the earliest clinical finding of diabetic nephropathy. The routine urine dipstick, however, is a relatively insensitive marker for proteinuria, not detecting protein until excretion exceeds 300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Using a specific assay for albumin is a more sensitive technique. The normal rate of albumin excretion is less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min);</span> persistent values between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (20 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> in a patient with diabetes is called persistent albuminuria or moderately increased albuminuria (historically called microalbuminuria) and is usually indicative of diabetic nephropathy (unless there is some other coexistent renal disease) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-estimated-albumin-excretion-rate-from-spot-urine-albumin-and-creatinine-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Values above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> are considered to represent severely increased albuminuria (the new terminology for what was formerly called macroalbuminuria) and which is also called overt proteinuria, clinical renal disease, or dipstick positive proteinuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The availability of effective therapy for diabetic nephropathy with ACE inhibitors and ARBs is the rationale for yearly screening of all patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes for increased albumin excretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80409%7ENEPH%2F60878\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80409 graphicRef60878 \">figure 4A-B</a>). Once a patient with diabetes is taking an ACE or an ARB for increased urinary albumin excretion, the value of continued yearly monitoring of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Instead, we perform an annual assessment of risk criteria (blood pressure, fasting lipid profile, smoking history) to identify patients at high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) who might benefit from interventions such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, ACE inhibitors, and statin therapy. We no longer recommend that these criteria be used to identify patients for stress testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>For sedentary adults (age &gt;50 years) with diabetes who are beginning an exercise program, we typically perform a physical examination and a resting electrocardiogram (ECG). In addition, all CVD risk factors should be treated (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Blood pressure control'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Dyslipidemia'</a> below). There are no randomized trial data to support the routine performance of exercise stress testing in asymptomatic patients with diabetes who are planning to begin an exercise program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The decision to perform stress testing prior to beginning an exercise program should be individualized.</p><p>We do not typically perform exercise stress testing in asymptomatic patients, as long as they are beginning a gentle exercise program with gradual progression as tolerated. However, the increased risk for asymptomatic coronary artery disease in those with diabetes and other risk factors suggests that an exercise tolerance test be considered prior to changing exercise levels in patients with diabetes who also have peripheral or carotid or coronary artery disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with diabetes have an increased risk for atherosclerosis due both to diabetes and to the frequent presence of other risk factors.

Despite the frequency of silent ischemia, however, it has not been proven that identifying asymptomatic disease or providing early intervention will improve outcomes in this population. In addition, CHD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, positive family history of early coronary disease, and presence of increased urinary albumin excretion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] do not predict the likelihood of having ischemic findings on stress testing or coronary angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>The evaluation and treatment of diabetic patients with known CHD is reviewed in detail elsewhere.

Studies comparing care by specialists and generalists have generated conflicting findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/104-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">104-108</a>]. For most patients with type 2 diabetes, care can be delivered by primary care providers and their health care teams in coordination with other specialists where appropriate. Patients in need of insulin therapy should be managed by or in consultation with an endocrinologist, if at all possible.</p><p>The decision to refer to an endocrinologist with expertise in diabetes management usually hinges on the complexity of the patient, the ability of the primary care team to achieve established goals of care in an individual, the need to manage diverse complications, and other factors such as the capacity of the primary care practitioner to teach self-management skills such as monitoring and insulin injections. Conversely, some specialty diabetes treatment practices have recognized the large overlap in the care that they provide with primary care and have taken on the responsibility of providing primary care for their patients. The ideal balance between primary and subspecialty care for the ever-increasing population of patients with type 2 diabetes will vary based on the resources and expertise available in different communities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2676065203\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Interventions can limit end-organ damage, and therefore, patients with diabetes require initial and ongoing evaluation for diabetes-related complications. We perform a history and physical exam two to three times yearly to obtain information on nutrition, physical activity, reduction of cardiovascular risk factors, current management, and diabetes-related complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63002\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63002 \">table 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H15054334\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic control'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) goals in patients with diabetes should be tailored to the individual, balancing the improvement in microvascular complications with the risk of hypoglycemia. A reasonable goal of therapy might be an A1C value of &le;7.0 percent for most patients (using an assay in which the upper limit of normal is 6.0 percent). Glycemic targets are generally set somewhat higher (eg, &lt;8 percent) for older adult patients and those with comorbidities or a limited life expectancy and little likelihood of benefit from intensive therapy. More stringent control (A1C &lt;6 percent) may be indicated for individual patients with type 1 diabetes and during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H15054361\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and target A1C'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycemic targets'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycemic targets'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-during-pregnancy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregestational diabetes mellitus: Glycemic control during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Target blood glucose values'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of cardiovascular morbidity is a major priority for patients with diabetes, especially type 2. Smoking cessation is essential for patients who smoke. Cardiovascular morbidity can also be significantly reduced with aggressive management of hypertension, cholesterol, and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (75 to 162 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> in patients with or at high risk for CVD.
