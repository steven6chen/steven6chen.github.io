Gestational breast cancer presents a challenging clinical situation, since the welfare of both the mother and the fetus must be taken into account. There are limited prospective data about diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of breast cancer during pregnancy; much of the clinical evidence is limited to retrospective case series and case reports. </p><p>The treatment and prognosis of gestational breast cancer will be reviewed here. The epidemiology and diagnosis of gestational breast cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational breast cancer: Epidemiology and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84662607\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, pregnant women with breast cancer should be treated according to guidelines for nonpregnant patients, with some modifications to protect the fetus. However, the treatment should be approached with curative intent. Therefore, treatment of gestational breast cancer should not be unnecessarily delayed because of pregnancy. Informed consent is a critical component of choosing appropriate therapy. Although pregnancy termination may be considered during treatment planning, pregnancy termination has not been demonstrated to improve outcomes in gestational breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H84662726\" class=\"local\">'Elective termination of pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>Importantly, all patients with gestational breast cancer should be evaluated for distant metastatic disease according to guidelines in nonpregnant patients with breast cancer. In order to protect the fetus, this can be attenuated to include: chest radiograph with fetal shielding, ultrasound of the liver, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine without contrast to evaluate for bone metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational breast cancer: Epidemiology and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis and staging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer#H1583246405\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Postdiagnosis evaluation'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84662614\"><span class=\"h2\">Locoregional treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The same local treatment options that are available for nonpregnant patients should be considered in pregnant women, with the exception of radiation therapy (RT). As in nonpregnant women, surgery is the definitive local treatment for gestational breast cancer. Breast and axillary lymph node surgery during any trimester of pregnancy appears to be associated with minimal fetal risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the pregnant patient undergoing nonobstetric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84662621\"><span class=\"h3\">Mastectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mastectomy may be chosen when the patient opts to continue the pregnancy, even for women with clinical anatomic stage I and II disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. An advantage of mastectomy may be the elimination of the need for breast RT. If breast reconstruction is desired, delaying until after delivery may be preferred, depending upon the reconstruction chosen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastectomy: Indications, types, and concurrent axillary lymph node management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84662628\"><span class=\"h3\">Breast-conserving surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapeutic equivalence of mastectomy and breast-conserving therapy (breast-conserving surgery [BCS] followed by RT) has been demonstrated in nonpregnant women; this is also true for the pregnant patient. BCS can be used effectively as RT can be delayed after the administration of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>BCS is feasible and safe in the pregnant woman with breast cancer and is reported to have no adverse impact on locoregional recurrence rates or complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. However, RT to the ipsilateral breast is important to achieve optimal local control, and therapeutic breast RT is contraindicated during pregnancy because of the risk associated with fetal radiation exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Therefore, RT should be delayed until after delivery. Alternatively, mastectomy could be considered if the diagnosis is made early in a pregnancy, systemic therapy is not warranted, and there would be a significant delay to RT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84662635\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT is used in the routine management of breast cancer to optimize local control in women who undergo BCS and may improve survival in certain high-risk women treated with mastectomy. Radiation should be delayed whenever possible until after delivery. If the clinician believes it is in the best interests of the patient, a discussion of potential risks and harms for the patient and the developing fetus is warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of therapeutic radiation is generally avoided during pregnancy because of the risk to the fetus. There are four categories of radiation sequelae to the fetus: pregnancy loss (miscarriage or stillbirth), malformation, disturbances of growth or development, and mutagenic and carcinogenic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The amount of radiation to which the fetus is exposed depends upon the dose and the stage of pregnancy when therapeutic radiation is administered. Even with appropriate shielding, fetal exposure to therapeutic breast irradiation will increase as the fetus grows and moves closer to the diaphragm. </p><p>Typical radiation doses used in breast cancer are between 46 to 60 Gray (Gy). It has been estimated that the administration of 50 Gy external beam irradiation to the breast could result in a first trimester fetal dose of 0.04 to 0.15 Gy, or a third trimester dose as high as 2 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The threshold at which an increased risk of congenital malformations is observed in radiation-exposed <span class=\"nowrap\">embryos/fetuses</span> has not been definitively determined. For the developing fetus under 16 weeks of gestation, the threshold for possible prenatal radiation effects is approximately 0.10 to 0.20 Gy (10 to 20 rads) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. After 16 weeks of gestation, the consensus of most researchers is that this threshold is much higher, at least 0.50 to 0.70 Gy (50 to 70 rads). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84662642\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of the axilla</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Axillary staging and dissection are important components of breast cancer therapy. Assessment of nodal status provides prognostic information and is used in selecting adjuvant treatment, and axillary lymph node dissection improves local disease control. The use of sentinel lymph node biopsies during pregnancy is controversial, with case series demonstrating increasing evidence of safety and efficacy in pregnant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/1,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20-22</a>]. Therefore, axillary lymph node dissection should be considered as standard approach. Should sentinel lymph node dissection be offered, the limited current data should be discussed with the patient. Those with clinically positive ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes or with inflammatory breast cancer are most likely to derive benefit from axillary lymph node dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the regional lymph nodes in breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The safety and efficacy of sentinel lymph node biopsy during pregnancy has not been fully evaluated. Some authors suggest that sentinel node biopsy is safe in pregnant patients with a minimal dose of 500 to 600 microCurie using double filtered technetium sulfur colloid, but no supporting studies for this approach are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Others, by deriving estimates of absorbed dose at the level of epigastrium, umbilicus, and hypogastrium in nonpregnant women undergoing sentinel node biopsy for breast cancer, have concluded that expected levels of fetal exposure would be below the 50 milligray (mGy) threshold absorbed dose for adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In addition to the above safety issues, it is not clear whether lymphatic pathways in the breasts of pregnant women are altered, making identification of the sentinel node more difficult. Small series of sentinel lymph node biopsy in pregnant patients have reported successful sentinel lymph node mapping with no apparent adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p>The use of ultrasound and fine needle aspiration in the assessment of clinically suspicious lymph nodes is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis#H84660395\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational breast cancer: Epidemiology and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Lymph nodes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84662649\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The data suggest it is safe to administer many agents used in the treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy when initiated after the first trimester, and that the majority of pregnancies result in live births with low related morbidity in the newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/3,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,30-32</a>]. The most data available are with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, often on an every-three-week schedule. Although only limited case reports are available, chemotherapy given on a dose-dense schedule (ie, treatment every two weeks) does not appear to increase the risks of maternal or fetal complications compared with treatment administered every three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The subtype of breast cancer and the week of pregnancy may inform the schedule of chemotherapy to choose.

However, chemotherapy in the second or third trimester has been associated with intrauterine growth restriction, lower gestational age at birth (prematurity), and low birth weight in about one-half of exposed infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/32,34,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34,45</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Among nonpregnant women, delaying the initiation of chemotherapy by three to six months diminishes the long-term value of the chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-treatment/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].&nbsp;In pregnant patients who have breast cancer, the challenging decision is often whether it is better to start chemotherapy or wait until after delivery.&nbsp;Patients often desire waiting until after delivery, to avoid risk to the pregnancy and to the baby.&nbsp;For pregnant breast cancer patients who need chemotherapy treatment, clinicians should advise against a delay in the initiation of systemic chemotherapy once the pregnancy has safely reached the second or third trimester. As noted, care needs to be taken to avoid exposing the fetus to chemotherapy during the first trimester, and to stop chemotherapy prior to delivery so that the mother and infant are not experiencing treatment-related toxicities in the delivery or postpartum stages.</p><p>Indications for preoperative chemotherapy in gestational breast cancer are discussed above.

Ideally, the delivery should occur following the mother's white blood cell count and platelet count nadir to reduce the potential risk of infectious complications and bleeding from thrombocytopenia. </p><p>Chemotherapy should be avoided for three to four weeks before delivery to avoid transient neonatal myelosuppression and potential complications of sepsis and death whenever possible. Also if possible, the fetus should be delivered after demonstration of fetal pulmonary maturity and at 34 or more weeks of gestation, at which time morbidity of prematurity is relatively low.
