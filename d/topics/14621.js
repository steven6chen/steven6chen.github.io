These characteristics differentiate telangiectases on the skin from the spider nevi that are common in advanced liver disease, which are always flat, blanch readily, refill centrally first, and are mainly found on the face and anterior chest. Capillary microscopy of the finger nail bed is a simple and noninvasive technique that may occasionally reveal abnormal capillary loops in patients without characteristic telangiectases, although this test is rarely performed.

One cited potential limitation of TTCE is that it may be too sensitive, detecting clinically unimportant PAVMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. This was illustrated by several studies that found that TTCE continued to detect intrapulmonary shunting in 80 percent of patients even after successful embolization of all visible PAVMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p>TTCE involves the injection of echocardiographic contrast, usually 10 to 20 mL of agitated saline (generates microbubbles), into a peripheral vein while simultaneously imaging the right and left ventricles with two-dimensional echocardiography. The contrast is normally visualized in the right ventricle soon after injection and should not be visualized in the left cardiac chambers at all (microbubbles are filtered out by the pulmonary capillary network). The appearance of contrast in the left ventricle (microbubbles) is consistent with right-to-left shunt. </p><p>PAVMs are not directly visualized on echocardiography but shunts of cardiac or great vessel origin may be directly visualized which may help to distinguish PAVMs from other anatomic shunts. Visualizing an intracardiac shunt by TTCE should not preclude further evaluation of possible PAVMs if the suspicion for PAVMs is high. For example, in the presence of an atrial right-to-left shunt, contrast will appear in the left atrium immediately and therefore obscure any delayed shunt from a PAVM. In this case, TTCE or transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be used to diagnose PAVM by looking for contrast in the pulmonary veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>In the case of right&ndash;to-left shunt, contrast first appears in the right ventricle and then the left ventricle. The number of cardiac cycles that elapse between first appearance of contrast in the right ventricle and left ventricle can help to anatomically locate the shunt and, if visualized, microbubbles are counted so that the degree of shunting can be graded:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Timing</strong> &ndash; When microbubbles are seen in the left ventricle within one cardiac cycle of their appearance in the right ventricle, this is typically associated with an intra-cardiac shunt; within three to eight cycles is consistent with an intra-pulmonary shunt; and within one to three cardiac cycles the location of the shunt is indeterminate (ie, the shunt could be located within the heart, great vessels, or lung) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/53,54,58,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54,58,63,64</a>]. However, the location of shunt using this method has not been validated and is considered by many experts as a general guideline only because timing of contrast depends upon many factors including cardiac output, shunt size, and heart rate. For example, the shunt from large PAVM may occasionally be seen within one cardiac cycle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grading</strong> &ndash; Many experts grade the degree of shunting seen on TTCE in order to select those suitable for diagnostic CT scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/50,55,56,65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,55,56,65-67</a>]. Although there is little evidence to support the use of one grading system over another, we and some other experts prefer to use a quantitative grading system due to a preponderance of evidence to support its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/50,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,58</a>]. Subsequent diagnostic testing with non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest varies depending upon the grade:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Grade 0</strong> &ndash; Grade 0 refers to no bubbles reaching the left ventricle (ie, no right-to-left shunt).<strong> </strong>In general, patients whose TTCE finds no shunt require no further evaluation for PAVM, unless there is a high clinical suspicion for PAVM such as unexplained hypoxemia, suspicious nodule on imaging, or evidence to suggest paradoxical embolization (eg, stroke). In such patients, additional testing may include measurement of the shunt fraction by the 100 percent oxygen method, radionuclide perfusion scanning, or CT chest; CT chest is our preference. The preference for CT is based upon the higher diagnostic sensitivity compared with 100 percent oxygen and radionuclide perfusion scanning, which are not only not diagnostic of PAVM, but also less helpful than TTCE in demonstrating shunt. For patients with no shunt and low clinical suspicion for PAVM (eg, nodule with some features suggestive of cancer), additional investigations for the presenting complaint are indicated. In patients with HHT and a Grade 0 shunt, some experts will repeat TTCE in 5 to 10 years to follow for development of new PAVM, though this is clinical practice that is unproven. One study performed repeat TTCE five years later in 86 patients with HHT and grade 0 shunt and found that 26 percent developed a grade 1 shunt, though no one developed treatable PAVM or increased to grade 2 shunt during that time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Grade 1</strong> &ndash; Grade 1 refers to 1 to 30 bubbles seen in the left ventricle.

We believe that diagnostic decisions in this population should be discussed with the patient and should carefully weigh the small risk that a PAVM will remain undiagnosed versus the risks of radiation from CT. We generally advise the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In most patients with grade 1 shunt, no further evaluation is performed and patients should undergo yearly observation clinically for the development of progressive symptoms which may prompt a repeat TTCE. Many experts consider it prudent in this population that a repeat TTCE be performed within five years so that small PAVMs that may have grown during that interval will be detected. Shorter intervals (weeks or months) are not required due to the slow growth of PAVMs. One study performed repeat TTCE five years later in 55 patients with HHT and grade 1 shunt and found that 17 percent developed a grade 2 shunt, and some of these developed treatable PAVM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In patients with a grade 1 shunt where the clinician has a high suspicion for clinically significant PAVM including unexplained hypoxemia, suspicious nodule on imaging, or evidence to suggest paradoxical embolization (eg, stroke), we prefer diagnostic testing with chest CT to confidently include or exclude treatable PAVM.

As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>TTCE and thoracic CT were performed in 95 patients with HHT using a 4 point grading system (as opposed to the 3 point system described above). No patient with grade 0 or grade 1 shunt on TTCE was found to have PAVMs by thoracic CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

In addition, patients with a grade 1 shunt were no more likely to suffer cerebral complications than those with a grade 0 shunt (OR 0.44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>The optimal test for patients with an <strong>indeterminate</strong> TTCE (eg, appearance of contrast in the left atrium within 1 to 3 cardiac cycles or poor visualization of contrast or chambers due to poor technique) is unknown. In these circumstances, similar to patients with grade 1 shunt, we suggest that the clinical suspicion direct the course of investigation. As examples observation may be appropriate in those with a low suspicion for PAVM or other etiologies, a repeat TTCE for those with poor technical views, a CT chest for those with a high suspicion for PAVM, or transesophageal echocardiography when intracardiac shunt is suspected. </p><p>The techniques, safety, and clinical applications of contrast echocardiography are discussed separately.

These include measuring arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tension on 100 percent oxygen, oxygen saturation on room air, alveolar-arterial gradient, and radionuclide perfusion scanning.

It can be determined by the 100 percent oxygen method, which involves measuring the arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) and saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) and the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) after breathing 100 percent oxygen through a mouthpiece or airtight mask for 15 to 20 minutes and then using those values to calculate the shunt fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A shunt fraction of &gt;5 percent is considered abnormal and warrants additional evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The sensitivity of the shunt fraction at detecting PAVMs depends upon whether the PAVMs are clinically significant or asymptomatic. A shunt fraction &gt;5 percent appears to detect approximately 98 percent of clinically significant PAVMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/3,13,16,60,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,16,60,69</a>], but only 88 percent of asymptomatic PAVMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The magnitude of the shunt fraction varies among patients with PAVMs, with values ranging from 14 to 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259358544\"><span class=\"h4\">Oxygen saturation on room air</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the shunt fraction cannot be measured using the 100 percent oxygen method, an alternative approach is to measure the PaO<sub>2</sub> and arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) while the patient is breathing room air. A PaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;95 mmHg and an SaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;96.5 percent effectively excludes a significant shunt, while a PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;85 mmHg or an SaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;96 percent suggests a shunt fraction &gt;5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/3,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,69</a>]. However, this method is less specific than the 100 percent oxygen method because it does not differentiate a true shunt (either anatomic or physiologic) from ventilation-perfusion mismatch. The use of pulse oximetry alone is an insensitive screening method for PAVM and should not be used for this purpose, except perhaps in children where arterial puncture is generally avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

However, some clinicians have used it instead of the shunt fraction to identify PAVMs. One study of 105 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) who were being evaluated for treatable PAVMs found that an alveolar-arterial gradient &gt;24.5 kPa (184 torr) measured while breathing 100 percent oxygen in the upright position detected PAVMs with a sensitivity of only 59 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. This threshold was chosen because it corresponded with a shunt fraction &gt;5 percent in the investigators&rsquo; laboratory. However, the threshold corresponds to a shunt fraction of &gt;10 percent if conventional equations are used to determine the shunt fraction, which may explain why the sensitivity was so poor (ie, higher gradients are likely to cause a lower sensitivity and a higher specificity).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259352293\"><span class=\"h4\">Radionuclide perfusion scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radionuclide perfusion lung scanning does not typically anatomically define a PAVM but can confirm or identify the presence of a right-to-left shunt.

The test involves the peripheral, intravenous injection of macroaggregated albumin labeled with technetium-99m (<sup>99m</sup> Tc). In healthy persons, these particles are filtered by pulmonary capillaries. However, in the presence of true right-to-left shunts, radiolabeled particles pass through the lungs and are trapped in the brain and kidneys.

For those in whom angiography is not performed, patients should undergo yearly observation clinically for the development of progressive symptoms which may prompt a repeat TTCE and CT. It is also prudent in this population that a repeat CT be performed within three to five years to detect PAVMs that may have grown during that interval to a size that is amenable to embolotherapy; shorter intervals are not required due to the slow growth of PAVMs. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the CT scan is <strong>negative</strong> for PAVM and shunt is present on TTCE, microscopic PAVMs may be responsible for the shunt and follow-up as described above is prudent (ie yearly clinical evaluation and repeat imaging in three to five years). The optimal repeat imaging technique is unknown at this time. At our center we usually revert back to contrast echo and only repeat the CT scan if the severity of shunt significantly worsens. However, many centers continue to follow CT scans. Alternatively, shunt may be due to hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) such that evaluation for HPS is indicated. Pulmonary angiography is rarely performed in this population for patients with, for example, idiopathic stroke; however, in our experience, the likelihood of demonstrating a significant PAVM suitable for embolotherapy in this population is low.

Some experts occasionally perform contrast pulmonary angiography in patients with high grade shunt and indeterminate CT scans in whom the clinical suspicion is high. However, observation with follow-up TTCE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CT is also appropriate (eg, those with minimal symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a low grade shunt).</p><p/><p>We prefer multidetector, thin cut (ie, 1 to 2 mm collimation) CT, which readily detects PAVMs; three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction facilitates delineation of the vascular structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56072\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56072 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Contrast material is not required, except for patients with atypical nodules on non-enhanced CT in whom the suspicion remains high (eg, large shunt, clinical symptoms of paradoxical embolization such as stroke). Diagnostic imaging findings on CT are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H259348425\" class=\"local\">'Imaging findings'</a> above.) </p><p>This approach is based upon the high sensitivity of non-contrast-enhanced CT for the diagnosis of PAVMs. As an example, one study of 33 consecutive patients with 37 PAVMs compared non-contrast 3-D multidetector CT scanning with contrast-enhanced pulmonary angiography, which was the original gold standard at the time of the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. CT provided reliable analysis of more PAVMs than unilateral pulmonary angiography (76 versus 32 percent), but fewer PAVMs than hyper-selective pulmonary angiography (76 versus 100 percent; ie imaging the suspected PAVM only). (See <a href=\"#H259354498\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary angiography'</a> below.)</p><p>CT is more sensitive than conventional chest radiography for detecting PAVMs. This is because on chest radiography, small PAVMs can be easily missed and discrete PAVMs are occasionally obscured by the diaphragms, heart shadow, or concomitant parenchymal lung disease. CT identifies nearly all PAVMs, even those that are poorly appreciated on conventional chest radiographs such that CT is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Thus, while a completely normal chest radiograph makes the diagnosis of symptomatic PAVM less likely, it should not preclude further evaluation with CT or angiography, particularly in a symptomatic patient with other features consistent with PAVM or HHT. As an example, in a symptomatic patient, CT of the chest may demonstrate multiple small PAVMs that are undetectable or present as a vague increase in pulmonary vascular markings on chest radiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Contrast-enhanced ultrafast (ie, electron beam) CT uses an electron beam rather than a conventional x-ray beam to obtain images. The electron beam obtains images more quickly and, therefore, motion artifact is minimized. In a study of 40 patients with suspected PAVM, contrast-enhanced ultrafast CT was more sensitive than selective pulmonary angiography at detecting PAVM (98 versus 60 percent), but selective pulmonary angiography was better at determining the angioarchitecture of individual PAVMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The disadvantage of contrast-enhanced electron beam CT compared with multidetector CT is that contrast is required, although they have not been compared with one another.
