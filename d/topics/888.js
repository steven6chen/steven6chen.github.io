Deliberate hypothermia is induced with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to protect the brain and other vital organs from ischemia during this period of elective circulatory arrest. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) permits surgical reconstruction of the aortic arch without crossclamping a diseased aorta or instrumenting and possibly injuring aortic arch branch vessels. Selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) is a technique to perfuse the brain using the CPB circuit by direct cannulation of the axillary artery or aortic arch branch vessels. Retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) is a technique to improve the safety of DHCA by providing partial perfusion to the brain using the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit during interruption of antegrade cerebral perfusion.</p><p>This topic discusses anesthetic management and strategies for cerebral protection during cardiac surgical procedures requiring CPB with a period of DHCA, RCP, or SACP. Management of routine CPB and weaning from CPB are discussed separately.

In the preoperative period, patients with acute AR typically present with tachycardia and decompensated heart failure due to a sudden increase in LV diastolic pressure. Beta-blocker therapy to control heart rate (HR) or blood pressure (BP) should be withheld or administered cautiously to prevent cardiogenic shock in a patient with acute AR (or cardiac tamponade, as noted below).

The aortic root and the first 11 cm of the ascending aorta lie within the pericardial sac; thus, a contained rupture of the aortic root or proximal ascending aorta may result in hemopericardium with tamponade. Presence of blood in the pericardial space on the preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan or echocardiogram or signs of cardiac tamponade on physical examination should be noted. Severity of pericardial tamponade is assessed with preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) but may worsen during the course of a preoperative evaluation. Thus, severity is reassessed with intraoperative TEE after induction of general anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similar to patients with acute AR, beta-blocker therapy should be withheld or administered cautiously to prevent cardiogenic shock in a patient with cardiac tamponade. Other anesthetic management considerations for a patient with cardiac tamponade are described separately.

The resultant bleeding diathesis and potential for significant surgical bleeding require adequate central and peripheral venous access, as well as availability of blood products (typically 4 to 6 units of red blood cells [RBCs] and fresh frozen plasma [FFP]). Also, vasoactive infusions are prepared to treat vasoconstriction that typically occurs during cooling and hypothermia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasodilation during rewarming and reperfusion. In addition, an insulin infusion is prepared to control hyperglycemia.

Also, temperature is measured at multiple sites to monitor cooling to produce deliberate hypothermia and subsequent gradual rewarming to avoid unintentional hyperthermia. In addition, brain monitoring is typically employed (electroencephalography [EEG] and cerebral oximetry), as well as invasive cardiovascular monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H230752964\"><span class=\"h2\">Intra-arterial catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intra-arterial catheter is typically inserted in an upper extremity prior to induction and is used for continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure (BP), analysis of respirophasic variations in the arterial pressure waveform, and intermittent blood sampling for intraoperative laboratory tests. Selection of the site for intra-arterial cannulation is affected by the likely accuracy of BP measurements in one or both upper extremities. For example, if the surgical procedure involves reconstruction of the distal aortic arch, the left subclavian artery may be temporarily occluded or interrupted. In such cases, a right radial intra-arterial catheter provides the most accurate monitor of systemic BP. If an aortic dissection extends into an aortic arch branch vessel or involves the subclavian artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F100115\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100115 \">figure 1</a>), malperfusion of one or more extremities may occur. In such cases, BP is more accurately measured in a limb perfused by an artery that is not affected by the dissection. In some instances of limb malperfusion, multiple arterial catheters in different limbs may be necessary for optimal assessment of the central aortic BP during various phases of the operation.</p><p>If SACP is planned, it may be useful to place arterial cannulae in both upper extremities. Since the right axillary artery is typically cannulated for both cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and delivery of SACP, continuous measurement of arterial BP from the right radial artery will be temporarily interrupted or affected during initial cannulation of the right axillary artery. Ideally, BP measured in the contralateral arm is used to monitor systemic perfusion pressure during this cannulation period. Subsequently, during CPB, the BP measured from the right radial artery (ipsilateral to the cannulated right axillary artery) will overestimate systemic perfusion pressure. However, during SACP delivery via the right axillary artery, the BP measured from the right radial artery provides the best estimate of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Thus, during different stages of the operation, optimal continuous estimates of both central aortic BP and CPP can be obtained only if intra-arterial catheters are present in both upper extremities. (See <a href=\"#H2238660233\" class=\"local\">'Deep hypothermia with selective antegrade cerebral perfusion'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2868326478\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary artery catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large-bore central venous catheter (CVC) is necessary to permit the rapid administration of blood products and provide central vascular access for the infusion of vasoactive agents. Use of an introducer sheath (eg, Cordis) that functions as a large-caliber CVC and as a means to place a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is recommended.</p><p>A PAC catheter is typically inserted to monitor pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output (CO), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) throughout the prebypass and postbypass periods. These values are useful for guiding vasopressor and inotropic administration, as well as for monitoring responses to intraoperative fluid and blood administration &#160; During initiation of CPB or infusion of antegrade cardioplegia, an increase in the PAP may indicate left ventricular (LV) distention due to aortic regurgitation (AR).

TEE is also used to assess the structure and function of the other cardiac valves, to evaluate regional and global left and right ventricular (RV) function, and to assess volume status, similar to its use in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and other cardiac surgical procedures.

Clinical data have demonstrated that each of the temperature monitoring sites within the body (see <a href=\"#H3742267840\" class=\"local\">'Temperature monitors'</a> above) underestimates temperature monitored with a jugular venous catheter positioned with its tip in the jugular bulb, considered to be the optimal site for monitoring cerebral temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-aortic-surgery-requiring-deep-hypothermia/abstract/54,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,66</a>]. Since monitoring jugular bulb temperature is not usually feasible, the best alternative for avoiding cerebral hyperthermia is to ensure that no temperature site ever exceeds 37&deg;C, particularly the arterial outlet temperature, even if this prolongs the rewarming process. During rewarming, temperature of the venous blood returning into the venous reservoir of the CPB circuit estimates systemic temperature, while the bladder temperature provides an estimate of &quot;core&quot; temperature (ie, the body temperature at thermal equilibrium in the periphery).

For acute aortic dissection requiring emergency surgical repair, intraoperative TEE is used to verify the diagnosis and detect complications such as cardiac tamponade, acute AR, or global or regional ventricular dysfunction indicating ischemia. Similar to other cardiac surgical procedures, TEE is also used to assess the causes of acute life-threatening hemodynamic instability.

If EEG monitoring is being performed in anticipation of a period of DHCA, the volatile anesthetic dose is maintained at a fixed end-tidal concentration, and bolus doses of IV anesthetic agents are avoided before and during cooling to minimize anesthetic-induced EEG changes.

If duration of DHCA is anticipated to be &gt;30 to 40 minutes, such lower target temperatures may be selected. The presence of burst suppression or electrocortical silence on the EEG is frequently used as a neurophysiologic surrogate to monitor for adequacy of brain hypothermia.

When the arterial outlet temperature reaches 30&deg;C, this gradient can be &le;4&deg;C. At all times, the arterial blood outlet temperature should remain &le;36.5&deg;C.
