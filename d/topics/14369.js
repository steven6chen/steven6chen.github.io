It is widely available, fast, and provides a detailed view of the internal organs and structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. &#160; &#160;</p><p>The two major types of CT are helical CT and conventional, axial, step-and-shoot CT. Helical CT is most prevalent, but conventional step-and-shoot, axial technique is used for high-resolution CT scanning of the lungs, coronary artery calcium scoring, and prospective ECG-triggered coronary CT angiography.</p><p>The technical aspects of CT are reviewed here. The role of CT in various clinical situations is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High resolution computed tomography of the lungs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=computed-tomographic-and-positron-emission-tomographic-scanning-of-pulmonary-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Computed tomographic and positron emission tomographic scanning of pulmonary nodules&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Computed tomography of the hepatobiliary tract&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive coronary imaging with cardiac computed tomography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL DESCRIPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal components of a CT scanner are the x-ray tube and a diametrically opposed array of detectors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The x-ray tube rotates around the patient and generates an x-ray beam (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68855 \">figure 1</a>). The gantry motion is helical during helical CT and circular during conventional, axial, step-and-shoot CT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The detectors concurrently record the radiation that traverses the body, while rejecting scattered radiation emanating from outside the x-ray tube focal spot (the area of the target of the x-ray tube) with collimators on the x-ray tube side and on the detector side.</p><p/><p>During conventional, axial, step-and-shoot CT, the patient is moved into the desired position (ie, step) and then the x-ray tube rotates around the patient (ie, shoot). These two steps are repeated, with the table inching sequentially along the longitudinal or z-axis while the x-ray production is interrupted, until the scan is complete. In contrast, during helical CT, the rotation of the x-ray tube and the movement of the patient through the gantry (the portion of the CT scanner that contains the x-ray tube and detectors) are continuous. This uninterrupted production of radiation accounts for the much higher radiation exposure during helical acquisition.</p><p>Helical CT facilitates the uninterrupted acquisition of raw data. The transmitted intensity of the x-ray beam decreases exponentially as it traverses the patient, due to absorption in tissue. The data acquisition system converts the residual intensity profile in the detector to attenuation values per voxel in 3-D volume. These values are processed to projection data after being filtered with either soft tissue (standard) or bone (high frequency) algorithm. These raw data are then projected onto the image domain where they are digitized by analog to digital converters and then reconstructed into axial images using array processors and interpolation algorithms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These devices record, digitize, store, and reconstruct 800 to 1500 views per 360 degrees of rotation around the patient. Each view is acquired at a slightly different angle using mathematical algorithms.</p><p>The resulting tomographic images are composites of individual volume elements (voxels) displayed as two-dimensional picture elements (pixels). Each pixel has a numerical value that is called a CT number:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>CT number = [(AM - <span class=\"nowrap\">AW)/AW]</span> x 1000</p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>where AM is the linear attenuation coefficient of a material (eg, soft tissue, bone, fat) and AW is the linear attenuation coefficient of water. The CT number is expressed in Hounsfield units (HU). The HU scale is calibrated from -1000 HU for gas to +1000 HU for high attenuation metal. The physical density of materials correlates closely with the Hounsfield Units and can be calculated with the formula HU + 1000 = Density in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span>.</p></div></div><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Configuration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The configuration of CT scanners has changed with the advent of slip rings. The stepwise approach to imaging used by conventional, step-and-shoot, axial CT was previously necessary because gantry cables needed to unwind through reverse rotation of the gantry. However, the invention of slip rings allowed electrical current to be supplied to the scanner and electronic data to be transferred from the gantry to the computer without gantry cables. It also allowed helical CT scanners to be developed, since continuous rotation of the x-ray tube became possible without gantry cables. Most imaging is now done by helical CT scanners, which are also called spiral or volumetric CT scanners (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68855 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Advantages'</a> below.)</p><p>Many institutions are using helical CT scanners with multidetector-rows and multiple channels. Such scanners are also called multislice helical CT scanners. Multislice helical CT scanners use a cone-shaped x-ray beam with wider collimation, which strikes many of the 16 to 320 parallel detector rows during a single scanning cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. Sixty-four slice helical CT scanners are in wide clinical use, while 320 slice helical CT scanners and dual source helical CT scanners have been introduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Multislice helical CT'</a> below.)</p><p>Dual source CT scanners are capable of either of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using two x-ray sources to scan simultaneously generates two data sets at a 90 degree angle offset. This improves the temporal resolution by decreasing the smallest time interval that can resolve a dynamic process with helical CT to 70 msec or 83 msec [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using dual energy of 80 kVp and 140 kVp simultaneously allows subtraction of unwanted calcium or other high attenuation materials, also called material decomposition, since measured attenuation of materials varies with different incident energy beams and different atomic numbers of scanned substances. Iodine maps after intravenous injection of contrast material allow for determination of perfusion after subtraction of normal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Dual energy imaging facilitates the generation of synthetic monochromatic beams with spectral monochromatic imaging which eliminates streak artifacts and blooming artifacts and allows for increased intravascular contrast when the keV of the monochromatic beam approaches the Jodine K-edge (33 keV). It allows for a reduction in the injected iodine dose. So called water imaging is possible after electronic extraction of iodine from the vascular lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Dual energy imaging can be achieved with single source scanners that have the capability of dynamic rapid energy switching every 0.5 milliseconds.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANTAGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT is superior to conventional radiography because of its exquisite contrast resolution. CT uses point attenuation, which can detect differences in contrast of less than 0.5 percent. In comparison, conventional radiography uses ray attenuation, which can detect differences in contrast of approximately 5 percent. This represents a tenfold increase in contrast resolution. Another advantage of CT over conventional radiography is that anatomic structures in different planes are displayed free of superimposition.</p><p>Helical CT has several advantages over prior generations of CT scanners. Its primary advantage is its speed, obtaining an image by scanning only 180 degrees (ie, half-scan imaging) with a gantry rotation time of 0.27 to 0.35 seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. Consequences of this speed are reduction of motion artifacts, implementation of cardiac imaging, and improved scan coverage during a single breath hold. The helical, volumetric data set eliminates respiratory misregistration, defined as gaps or overlap in images obtained during several respiratory cycles due to variation in the depth of inspirations.</p><p>Helical CT can reconstruct high quality, near-isotropic, overlapping axial source images that allow for multiplanar two-dimensional and three-dimensional reformatted images at arbitrary levels within the scanned volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. It can also be used for CT angiography because it can rapidly acquire data during the bolus or arterial phase of intravenous contrast material injection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SETTINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several of the parameters used in helical CT are set by the operator. These include the collimation of the x-ray beam in single-slice CT scanning and the reconstructed section thickness in multislice CT scanning, pitch, field of view, duration of the helix, reconstruction interval, reformation algorithm or kernel, and reconstruction phase in cardiac CT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Collimation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Collimation refers to the thickness of the x-ray beam. In standard single-slice helical CT, collimation determines the thickness of the section:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard collimation for scanning the chest is 2.5 mm for the mediastinum and 1.25 mm for the lung parenchyma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narrow collimation (1 to 1.25 mm) is used for CT pulmonary angiography, high resolution CT scanning of the lung parenchyma, and imaging of small pulmonary nodules</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wide collimation (2.5 mm) is used in heavy patients to decrease the quantum noise, although at the cost of decreased spatial resolution</p><p/><p>Collimation determines the thickness of a section in standard single-slice helical CT. However, it is the detector width that determines the minimal achievable thickness of a section in multislice helical CT. Subsequently, the data acquisition system can combine several detector row widths in order to achieve the desired reconstructed section thickness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pitch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pitch represents the table speed per rotation of the x-ray beam (ie, the table feed or table increment) divided by the beam collimation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pitch of 1 is generally used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pitch &gt;1 allows for greater coverage per unit time. The advantages of a pitch &gt;1 are a reduction in the patient's radiation exposure and a shorter acquisition time of the data set. However, it also decreases the z-axis (ie, longitudinal) resolution, which blurs the image. As an example, helical CT with a pitch of 2 increases the perceived slice thickness by 20 to 30 percent compared to conventional CT with a pitch of 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/5,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pitch &lt;1 increases the quality of reformatted images considerably. However, it also increases the duration of the scan and the patient's radiation exposure. In cardiac CT scanning, a pitch of around 0.25 is frequently used with retrospective ECG gating.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of the helix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of the helix is the time that is necessary to scan an entire volume of tissue. As examples, with a 64 slice helical CT, the cardiac structures can be scanned in 5 to 8 seconds, the entire chest in 10 to 12 seconds, and the entire body in 15 to 20 seconds. A 320 slice helical CT can scan the entire heart in less than one second.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Reconstruction interval</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reconstruction interval (also called the slice index) is the distance between reconstructed axial images. It determines the degree of overlap of reformatted sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/5,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22,23</a>]. A reconstruction interval of half the detector width is frequently used, according to the Nyquist sampling theorem. This achieves 50 percent overlap, which increases the visibility of small lesions and eliminates partial volume effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Gantry rotation time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gantry rotation time (ie, the cycle or revolution time) is generally not set by the operator. It refers to the duration in which the x-ray beam rotates 360 degrees. It is usually 0.27 to 0.7 seconds. The limiting factor for decreasing the rotation time is the gravitational stress on the equipment, since G-forces in excess of 15 are generated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">BREATHING INSTRUCTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breathing instructions are important when the chest is being scanned. The goal is for the patient to suspend respiration at the end of a deep inspiration to total lung capacity. This prevents motion artifact and respiratory misregistration (gaps or overlap in breathing cycles due to variation in the depth of inspiration).</p><p>Patients should hyperventilate by taking three or four deep inspirations. Then, they should suspend respiration at the end of an inspiration for 10 to 32 seconds. This is called the single acquisition, single breathhold technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>For patients who cannot hold their breath long enough to complete a scan, multiple preprogrammed helical scans of 5 to 15 seconds can be performed with breathing intervals of 6 to 7 seconds between scans. This approach is called the split breath hold or variable mode technique (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64610\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64610 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It is only rarely used now, since scan cycles of less than one second and multislice CT scanning have decreased the duration of the breath hold necessary for patients to complete the scan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following intravenous injection, contrast material distribution occurs in three pharmacokinetic phases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The early vascular or bolus phase corresponds to the duration of the contrast material injection. Arterial enhancement increases gradually and reaches a peak value at the completion of the injection. The rate of the increase is proportional to the rate of the injection, the iodine concentration, and the volume of contrast material. In contradistinction, the rate of increase is inversely proportional to the patient's cardiac output and body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The redistribution phase occurs within one to three minutes after the injection of contrast material. During this phase, the contrast agent diffuses from the intravascular to the extravascular compartment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the equilibrium phase, the contrast material in the intravascular and extravascular compartments reaches a dynamic equilibrium. This phase is not desirable for imaging.</p><p/><p>For a helical CT of the chest, the goal is to scan the chest during the bolus phase and the liver during the redistribution phase. However, scanning the lung parenchyma can extend into the redistribution and equilibrium phases without any decrement in quality if pleural, hilar, or mediastinal pathology is not expected. If only lung pathology is expected, then scanning should be performed without intravenous contrast material administration in order to avoid potential streak artifacts from vascular structures, so called hurricane artifacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Timing the scan with respect to the intravenous injection of contrast material requires that the injection rate, duration of the injection, volume of contrast material, delay time, and scan duration be considered. Low osmolar or iso-osmolar nonionic contrast agents are preferred. They are injected intravenously at a rate of 3 to 5 mL per second, with a delay of 30 to 45 seconds. Shorter delay times are used when performing CT pulmonary angiography or CT coronary arteriography. In such cases, the optimal delay is determined with a timing bolus or with bolus tracking technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'CT angiography'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis and management of adverse effects of intravenous contrast material including hypersensitivity reactions and nephropathy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: Prevention of recurrent reactions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-contrast-nephropathy-associated-with-angiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of contrast nephropathy associated with angiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DATA PROCESSING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each rotation of the x-ray tube generates data (800 to 1500 views) for an angled plane of section. From these data, interpolation algorithms generate virtual axial displays by interpolating data points below and above the plane of section [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A wide algorithm interpolates points separated by a 360 degree rotation, while a slim algorithm interpolates points separated by a 180 degree rotation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51274\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51274 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The x- and y-axis resolutions (also called in-plane resolution) are determined primarily by x-ray tube focal spot but also by the interpolation algorithm, and voxel matrix configuration. The z-axis resolution is determined primarily by the section thickness and section sensitivity profile which is a curve that shows the effect of increased section thickness along the patient&rsquo;s longitudinal axis on spatial resolution in the z-axis. The interpolation algorithm, pitch, and reconstruction interval contribute to the z-axis resolution.</p><p>Ideally, the z-axis resolution should be the same as the x- and y-axis resolutions. This is called isotropic imaging and it is important because it allows for accurate multiplanar reformations, devoid of &ldquo;stair artifacts.&rdquo; It facilitates the depiction of findings in any desired plane and in three dimensions.</p><p>In multidetector row CT scanners, the number of slices generated per rotation is determined by electronic channels that combine several detector rows to form one slice. Newer helical CT scanners with 64 or more channels and a detector width of 0.5 to 0.625 mm increase the z-axis resolution, so that near-isotropic resolution is achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">TWO-DIMENSIONAL AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL RENDERING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Production of two-dimensional and three-dimensional images is a sophisticated application of helical CT. The images are more dramatic than routine axial images, but the process is labor intensive, requires a dedicated workstation, and includes interpolation, segmentation, and rendering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interpolation involves constructing new data points within the range of known data points</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments thereby allowing structures of little interest to be eliminated or subtracted</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rendering or reformatting is the generation of an image from a model utilizing the axial source images</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Two-dimensional</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maximum intensity projection (MIP), minimum intensity projection (MINIP), multiplanar reformation (MPR), and curved MPR are two-dimensional rendering techniques.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MIP is obtained by orienting algebraic rays along a preselected projection and then determining the maximum attenuation value encountered by the rays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. The pixels with the highest values are preferentially displayed. The two-dimensional quality of the images produced with MIP is excellent and approaches the quality of conventional angiograms. They are diagnostically more useful than volume rendering or shaded surface display. Their disadvantage is the loss of contrast resolution ensuing from the preferential display of the maximal attenuation in the data set which is brought forward in the image and may cover up other structures in the vessel lumen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MINIP is similar to MIP except that it preferentially displays the pixels with the minimum attenuation values encountered by the rays. It provides an excellent image of the trachea and bronchi.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Curved MPR uses a single voxel plane that is perpendicular to a curvilinear line to longitudinally display a structure, also called center line technology. A volume is generated by stacking the axial source images sequentially. Curved multiplanar images track the center of a tubular structure and the entire length of the tubular structure is then displayed as a single image (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74724\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74724 \">image 1</a>). The appearance of the tubular structure's lumen and wall can be excellent, although the quality of the image is dependent upon the skill of the operator or the quality of the software. The surrounding structures are frequently distorted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Newer algorithms automatically render two-dimensional images using both curved MPR and stretched planar reformatting (similar to curved MPR except that it uses a straight line instead of a curvilinear line). Curved MPR is useful for CT coronary arteriography. Centerline technology facilitates rendering and display, and relies heavily on precise placement of the center line.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Three-dimensional</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three-dimensional rendering requires precisely defining the volume that is to be imaged. The volume should be kept small, since the z-axis resolution is inversely proportional to the length of the imaging volume. Several advanced techniques are available to display the volumetric data set in three dimensions once the imaging volume has been defined:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shaded surface display (SSD) &ndash; SSD establishes a threshold value, above and below which pixels are excluded. The remaining pixels are manipulated by the computer to produce images with an excellent vascular contour, although a loss of contrast resolution remains a problem (ie, calcified arteriosclerotic plaques are not visible) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32</a>]. SSD has been replaced by volume rendering.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume rendering (VR) &ndash; VR assigns each pixel its own unique opacity and color. These opacity and color assignments are then used to create a three-dimensional image, which displays the surface and interior of a structure with tissue-like effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virtual reality (ie, perspective rendering or &quot;fly through&quot; imaging) is used for CT bronchoscopy and other endoluminal applications. It gives the viewer the perspective of being within the lumen.

The collimation, gantry rotation time, and duration of helix are set as described above (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Settings'</a> above). The detector width is generally 0.5 to 2 mm and the pitch depends upon the type of CT angiogram being performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During CT pulmonary angiography, the pitch is usually 1.5 to 2</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During CT coronary arteriography, the pitch is usually 0.23 to 0.25</p><p/><p>Optimal vascular enhancement with contrast material is essential for high quality CT angiography. In most cases, 100 to 160 mL of low or iso-osmolar contrast material (320 to 370 mg iodine per mL) are injected at a rate of 3 to 6 mL per second. A typical delay for CT pulmonary angiography is 15 to 20 seconds and for CT coronary arteriography is 20 to 30 seconds.</p><p>The exact volume and rate of the contrast material injection are based upon the delay time, which can be estimated using either a timing bolus of 20 mL of contrast material injected at 5 mL per second or bolus tracking technology. The optimal delay time can be calculated with a timing bolus and represents the sum of the contrast material travel time (&ldquo;time to peak&rdquo;) and the acquisition time needed to scan the volume or organ of interest. Patients who have a short contrast material travel time (ie, a high cardiac output or large central blood volume) are administered a larger volume of contrast material at a higher injection rate. This increases vascular enhancement, mitigating the tendency of a high cardiac output to decrease vascular enhancement. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous contrast'</a> above.)</p><p>The helical data set is reconstructed into virtual axial sections using a reconstruction interval that provides 50 to 66 percent overlap. This facilitates a smooth, three-dimensional display without partial volume effects.</p><p>Axial source images followed by two-dimensional multiplanar reformations have the best spatial and contrast resolution. They are also the least susceptible to artifacts. The three-dimensional rendering techniques described above have been used to display CT angiograms, while two-dimensional rendering with retrospective ECG gating may improve visualization of the coronary arteries, especially with volumetric 64 to 320 slice CT scanners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTISLICE HELICAL CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multislice helical CT is a major technical development in helical CT scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/6-8,37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,37-41</a>]. During multislice helical CT, a cone-shaped x-ray beam (wider collimation than the conventional fan-shaped x-ray beam) strikes many of the 16 to 320 detector rows that are arranged in parallel along the longitudinal axis (ie, the direction of the table motion). The combination of a cone-shaped x-ray beam and multiple rows of detectors allows a larger proportion of the x-ray beam to be used for imaging purposes (ie, the detective quantum efficiency is 11 to 22 percent instead of 5.5 percent), instead of being converted to heat. Multiple channels extract the data that are obtained simultaneously from different anatomic sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multislice helical CT scanners acquire data up to 64 times faster than single slice helical CT scanners. This is primarily a consequence of the simultaneous acquisition of 64 slices, since gantry rotation is only slightly faster (gantry rotation times are limited by the G-forces that are generated). Thus, multislice helical CT scanners can cover 64 times more patient length per unit time, the same patient length in a shorter time, or the same patient length in the same time with thinner slices, when compared to the original single slice helical CT scanners. Increasing the pitch can further increase the anatomic coverage or decrease the examination time. The entire chest can be scanned in less than ten seconds with a multislice helical CT scanner.</p><p>Multislice helical CT has additional advantages, both technical and clinical, compared to single slice helical CT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Its 360 degree reconstruction algorithm reduces signal noise by a factor of 1.4, compared to the 180 degree reconstruction algorithm that is used in single slice helical CT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several hundred image slices are generated in 60 seconds or less, facilitating the visualization of image stacks. The abundant images are best viewed and manipulated on a PACS workstation rather than conventional film.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Faster image acquisition results in fewer motion artifacts. Temporal resolution is not influenced by the number of detector rows, but is directly dependent upon the rotation speed of the gantry (ie, 270 to 350 msecs).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spatial resolution (ie, the ability to distinguish objects that are separate but close together) and z-axis resolution are both improved, thereby generating nearly isotropic voxels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic coverage is increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contrast enhancement is optimal, with enhanced conspicuity of vascular structures.

In addition, CT should be used judiciously and overutilization avoided, in order to avoid the potential induction of radiogenic cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) is an imaging technique that has revolutionized medical imaging. It is widely available, fast, and provides a detailed view of the internal organs and structures. Helical CT is most common, but conventional, axial, step-and-shoot CT is used for thin section high resolution CT scanning of the lungs, coronary artery calcification scoring, and prospective ECG-gated coronary CT angiography. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The principal components of a CT scanner are the x-ray tube and a diametrically opposed array of detectors. The x-ray tube generates an x-ray beam as it rotates around the patient and the detectors concurrently record the radiation that traverses the body. The acquired data are digitized and then reconstructed into axial images. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General description'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT is superior to conventional radiography because of its exquisite contrast resolution and its lack of superimposition of anatomic structures. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Advantages'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helical CT is superior to conventional, step-and-shoot, axial CT because it is faster and it minimizes respiratory misregistration and motion artifacts. In addition, helical CT can enable the performance of CT angiography with subsequent reformation of high quality multiplanar two-dimensional and three-dimensional images. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Advantages'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Two-dimensional and three-dimensional rendering'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'CT angiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several of the parameters used in CT are set by the operator. These include the collimation of the beam and reconstructed section thickness, pitch, the field of view, the duration of the helix, the reconstruction interval, and the reconstruction algorithm or kernel. Operators must also be familiar with proper breathing instructions and protocols for the injection of intravenous contrast material. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Breathing instructions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous contrast'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multislice helical CT is a major technical advancement in helical CT scanning. It has many advantages over conventional single slice helical CT. However, its major drawback is its high effective radiation dose. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Multislice helical CT'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Radiation dose'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kang MJ, Park CM, Lee CH, et al.
