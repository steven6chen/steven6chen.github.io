Trauma precedes the condition in most cases, although the injury may have occurred years earlier. Injuries that are associated with the development of osteoarthritis include previous dislocation, humeral head or neck fracture, and large rotator cuff tendon tears (cuff tear arthropathy) and may also include detachments of the superior glenoid labrum from anterior to posterior (SLAP lesions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glenohumeral-osteoarthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis is more common in women and in patients over the age of 60.</p><p>Glenohumeral osteoarthritis must be distinguished from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affecting the glenohumeral joint. Shoulder involvement is common in RA, although typically fairly late in the course of disease. In one study, 55 percent of 74 patients with RA had developed radiographic evidence of erosive glenohumeral joint disease at 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glenohumeral-osteoarthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The symptoms of glenohumeral osteoarthritis and RA affecting the glenohumeral joint are identical; single joint involvement in an older patient suggests the former, while multiple joint involvement tends to occur in the latter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical examination in patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis is identical to that of patients with frozen shoulder, and presenting symptoms may be similar (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frozen-shoulder-adhesive-capsulitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)&quot;</a>). Radiographs are diagnostic in the former.</p><p>The clinical presentation, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of glenohumeral osteoarthritis are reviewed here. The clinical evaluation and use of imaging in patients with shoulder complaints are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-evaluation-of-the-painful-shoulder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic evaluation of the painful shoulder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis complain of the gradual development of anterior shoulder pain and stiffness over a period of months to years. The patient may rub the front of the shoulder while describing the symptoms. The pain generally is aggravated by activity and is relieved by rest, although patients may complain of night pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, patients with frozen shoulder may present with symptoms similar to those of patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and the physical examinations in both cases are nearly identical (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frozen-shoulder-adhesive-capsulitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)&quot;</a>). Thus, plain radiographs are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Occasionally, in early cases of osteoarthritis, more specialized radiographic studies are necessary to identify thinning of the glenoid articular cartilage. Patients with multiple affected joints should be screened for other arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following physical examination findings are typically present in patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local glenohumeral joint line tenderness and swelling anteriorly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of range of motion of external rotation and abduction </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrophy of the rotator cuff muscles over the scapula</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crepitation</p><p/><p>While osteoarthritis also is frequently associated with effusion, this may be difficult to detect on physical examination since the glenohumeral joint lies deep within the soft tissues. Large effusions may present with infraclavicular swelling or shoulder fullness, assessed best by looking down on the joint from above and by comparing the <span class=\"nowrap\">posterior/anterior</span> (PA) dimension with the healthy side.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Joint line tenderness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tenderness is located along the anterior joint line just under the thumb-shaped projection of the coracoid process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81764%7EEM%2F54102%7EEM%2F69995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81764 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995 \">figure 1A-C</a>). Firm outward and slightly upward pressure is necessary to elicit pain along the joint line.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Restricted range of motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endpoint stiffness and restricted external rotation and abduction are the hallmark physical signs of glenohumeral osteoarthritis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overhead arm raise is an active maneuver used to assess the range of motion of the shoulder joint and the strength of abduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65710\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65710 \">picture 1</a>). Full abduction requires a normal glenohumeral joint, intact rotator cuff tendons, a functional acromioclavicular (AC) joint, and reasonably well-developed deltoid and rotator cuff muscles. Patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis will have stiffness and pain with this maneuver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Apley scratch test is used to assess rotation of the shoulder joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F50093\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50093 \">picture 2</a>). Patients with normal glenohumeral motion should be able to scratch the midback at the T8 to T10 level. Patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis (or frozen shoulder and possibly acute rotator cuff tendinitis) have limited range of motion when compared with the healthy arm; the impairment of rotation correlates well with the severity of these conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passive movement of the arm in abduction and external rotation also is measured. The normal glenohumeral joint (without a history of subluxation or dislocation) rotates externally to 90 degrees and abducts to 90 to 110 degrees.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Crepitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crepitation with movement of the joint often can be palpated anteriorly in patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis; it may be audible in moderate to severe cases. Crepitation is best elicited by resisting abduction in mid-arc and by feeling for the crepitation as tension is released (as the humeral head moves rapidly across the irregular glenoid cartilage).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs of the shoulder (including PA, external rotation, Y-outlet, and axillary views) are recommended in patients with suspected glenohumeral osteoarthritis to differentiate this condition from frozen shoulder. Plain films are normal in patients with pure frozen shoulder, while cartilaginous wear, osteophytes on the inferior portion of the humeral head, sclerosis of the humeral head, and narrowing of the inferior portion of the glenohumeral articular cartilage (normal 3 to 4 mm) are characteristic of osteoarthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59306\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59306 \">image 1</a>). The earliest changes of osteoarthritis include narrowing of the articular cartilage and irregularities at the inferior glenoid fossa. The distance between the inferior glenoid and the humeral head gradually decreases as the disease progresses, and spurring of the inferior portion of the humeral head increases. A large spur may be evident in patients with advanced disease, along with flattening of the humeral head and obliteration of the articular cartilage at the inferior glenoid.</p><p>Specialized radiographic testing is not necessary in most patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis who have moderate to advanced disease and well-defined changes on plain film. Computed tomographic (CT) arthrography can be useful to detect earlier disease, particularly in young patients who have had trauma to the shoulder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glenohumeral-osteoarthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients with dramatic loss of strength in external rotation and abduction should be evaluated for a rotator cuff tear by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasonography of the shoulder, which is more commonly used to evaluate rotator cuff tendinopathy or guide injections, may reveal synovial hypertrophy, labral irregularities, and osseus changes in patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99423\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99423 \">image 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glenohumeral osteoarthritis is a slowly progressive disorder that is usually effectively controlled with physical therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and occasionally intraarticular injection. Maintenance toning exercises limit recurrences. Shoulder replacement surgery is indicated for patients who have impairment of overall shoulder function that has a significant impact on daily activities or that is associated with intractable pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute therapy of glenohumeral osteoarthritis consists of activity restrictions, heat followed by stretching exercises, and antiinflammatory therapy.

Abduction stretch should be limited to no higher than shoulder level, and patients should be advised to stretch to the point of tension but not pain.</p><p/><p>After the acute pain has resolved, patients should be instructed in general rotator cuff toning exercises (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59996 \">figure 2</a>).

A 3.5-inch, 22-gauge needle is necessary in the obese or muscular patient since the depth of the joint can be 2 to 2.5 inches (or approximately 5 to 6.5 cm).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethyl-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ethyl chloride</a> is sprayed on the skin.

It is crucial that the muscles of the shoulder are totally relaxed. Sets of 20 to 25 stretches in each direction are performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Begin the isometric toning exercises of lifting and rotation once the range of motion has begun to improve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75504\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75504 \">picture 3</a>). These exercises are necessary to restore any lost muscle strength. Mild muscle soreness in the back of the shoulder is expected. The exercise must be stopped if dramatic pain develops.</p><p/><p>The injection may be repeated at six weeks if overall improvement is less than 50 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29161415\"><span class=\"h4\">Intraarticular sodium hyaluronate injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of intraarticular glenohumeral joint injections for patients with persistent shoulder pain due to osteoarthritis. A study that showed statistically significant but clinically very modest benefit included 660 patients with shoulder pain of various etiologies; patients were randomly assigned to receive five weekly glenohumeral joint injections with sodium hyaluronate or buffered saline solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glenohumeral-osteoarthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>A statistically significant difference in shoulder pain favored the groups receiving either three or five hyaluronate injections versus those who received saline (placebo) injections. However, the predetermined primary endpoints of the study were not achieved, and the degree of benefit was small and of uncertain clinical significance. An improvement from baseline of at least 20 percent was statistically significantly more common in patients receiving five sodium hyaluronate injections compared with control injections (85 versus 77 percent). A subgroup analysis noted a statistically significant difference between those with glenohumeral osteoarthritis who received a series of three injections of hyaluronate and two saline injections versus those who received only saline injections.</p><p>The injection technique and aftercare instructions for sodium hyaluronate injections are similar to those described above for glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H29161401\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid injections'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral and surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repeat radiographs should be performed at three months to look for disease progression if the patient has lost significant range of motion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if symptoms have been progressive despite the above measures. Surgical consultation can be considered if symptoms fail to improve significantly with two injections, stretching exercises, and time (6 to 12 months).</p><p>The primary indication for surgery is pain that is unresponsive to medical management. The established surgical treatment for shoulder osteoarthritis is prosthetic replacement, except in patients younger than 50 years in whom arthroscopic debridement and removal of osteophytes might be attempted to delay the need for prosthetic replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glenohumeral-osteoarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The outcomes of this procedure, however, are unpredictable and should be seen as a measure of last resort in patients otherwise unsuitable for replacement due to age or to functional requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glenohumeral-osteoarthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A secondary, relative indication specifically for reverse shoulder replacement has been developed for the treatment of pseudoparalysis, the severe functional limitation associated with massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears, even in the setting of milder degrees of arthritis and pain. This very specific indication is the exception to the general rule that prosthetic replacement is performed primarily for pain relief rather than function.</p><p>Either hemiarthroplasty or total shoulder replacement (a more complicated and technically more difficult procedure) is performed, depending upon the condition of the glenoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glenohumeral-osteoarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Both are associated with high degrees of success in the appropriate patients (&gt;72 to 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glenohumeral-osteoarthritis/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].</p><p>Hemiarthroplasty results in less improvement in function compared with total shoulder arthroplasty but does not differ with respect to benefit for pain, range of motion, quality of life, or strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glenohumeral-osteoarthritis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Arthritis of the glenoid is responsible for continued pain and for the need for revision arthroplasty in some patients who undergo initial hemiarthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glenohumeral-osteoarthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Reverse (or also inverse) shoulder replacement is a further modification of traditional total shoulder replacement. By switching the position of the ball and socket components, a lever arm is created that can effectively substitute deltoid function for a deficient rotator cuff and that can provide improved function. It therefore provides an alternative to hemiarthroplasty for the treatment of osteoarthritis with associated irreparable rotator cuff deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glenohumeral-osteoarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Contraindications to surgical intervention include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic injury leading to an insufficient deltoid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient general health and fitness to undergo postprocedure physical therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severely reduced bone mineral density that increases risk of humeral fracture (a relative contraindication)</p><p/><p>Several factors affect the choice of procedure, including the preferences and personal experience of the surgeon.
