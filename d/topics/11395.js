Arthralgia, arthritis, osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone), and myopathy are the principal manifestations. Osteoporosis, often due to glucocorticoid therapy, may increase the risk of fractures.</p><p>The musculoskeletal manifestations of SLE in adults are reviewed here. SLE in children and an overview of the clinical manifestations of SLE in adults are presented separately.

The ankles, elbows, shoulders, and hips are less frequently involved. Involvement of the sacroiliac joints and cervical spine may occur but is rare. Monoarticular arthritis is unusual and suggests an alternative cause such as infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morning stiffness is usually measured in minutes and is not prolonged as in RA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The degree of pain often exceeds objective physical findings, and tenderness may be difficult to assess because of increased pain sensitivity in some patients, which can be associated with coexisting fibromyalgia.</p><p/><p>Although the arthritis of SLE is generally considered to be nondeforming, flexion deformities, ulnar deviation, soft tissue laxity, and swan neck deformities, as seen in RA, have been noted in 15 to 50 percent of patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. However, unlike RA, erosions in the hand are rarely noted on plain radiographs of the hands in SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Although the use of ultrasound in evaluating lupus arthritis is relatively common in clinical practice, there are few studies in this area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Similar to magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound can also reveal erosive changes and abnormalities of the soft tissues, including capsular swelling, tenosynovitis, and synovial proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. The presence of antibodies to citrullinated <span class=\"nowrap\">peptides/proteins</span> in SLE patients is strongly associated with erosive arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p>The hand deformity tends to occur in patients who have been receiving glucocorticoids, who have anti-Ro <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-La antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], or who have longstanding disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In contrast to the typical findings in RA, these deformities are usually easily reducible; they are thought to be due to lax joint capsules, tendons, and ligaments that cause joint instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, the hand deformities in patients with SLE resemble Jaccoud&rsquo;s arthritis, a nonerosive chronic deforming arthritis that may follow acute rheumatic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Tendons may also be involved in SLE. Tenosynovitis has been noted in 10 to 44 percent of patients, including epicondylitis, rotator cuff tendinitis, Achilles tendinitis, tibialis posterior tendinitis, and plantar fasciitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/4,5,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,16,17</a>]. Infrapatellar and Achilles tendon ruptures are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-achilles-ankle-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-Achilles ankle tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H370426595\"><span class=\"h2\">Synovial involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synovial effusions are infrequent in patients with SLE. When they occur, they are usually small, and the fluid is clear or slightly cloudy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In contrast to the highly inflammatory exudates of RA, the synovial fluid is only mildly inflammatory, with low protein levels and white blood cell counts (similar to a transudate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and lupus erythematosus (LE) cells have been observed in synovial fluids and, if present, have been thought to be useful diagnostically. However, they add little to a positive ANA in the serum.</p><p>Synovial histopathology tends to be nonspecific, with superficial fibrin-like material and local or diffuse synovial cell lining proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Vascular changes have included perivascular mononuclear cells, lumen obliteration, enlarged endothelial cells, and thrombi; fibrinoid necrosis (eg, vasculitis) is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Synovitis in SLE has a molecular synovial signature distinct from that seen in osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis in that interferon-inducible genes are upregulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Septic bacterial arthritis is uncommon, although patients with SLE may be intrinsically immunosuppressed and may become more so with medication. When septic arthritis occurs, it can be secondary to infections with Salmonella, gonococci, meningococci, and other organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of arthritis and arthralgias associated with SLE can often be limited to a background of antimalarial drugs and symptomatic treatment with analgesic medications. Low doses of glucocorticoids may be required to treat the arthritis in patients also having a systemic disease flare. For patients with persistent arthritis, additional immunosuppressive agents or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may also be used in a manner largely based upon the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pain from arthritis must be distinguished from fibromyalgia, which is more common among patients with SLE. The arthritis in patients with SLE must also be distinguished from osteoarthritis. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Fibromyalgia'</a> below.)</p><p>The following is our general approach to drug therapy in patients with arthralgias and arthritis associated with SLE:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with SLE should already be receiving antimalarial drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>), unless otherwise contraindicated, which are effective for the amelioration of joint symptoms as well as for the prevention of disease flares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. We use hydroxychloroquine 200 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> and the dose should not exceed 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of real (actual) body weight per day to avoid retinal toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimalarial drugs in the treatment of rheumatic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for symptomatic relief of arthritic pain if not otherwise contraindicated. Our approach to using NSAIDs for symptomatic relief of arthritis symptoms is presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H3693478\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'NSAIDs'</a>). Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> (up to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in the absence of liver disease or alcohol abuse) may be used if NSAIDs are contraindicated &ndash; or ineffective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids may be added to control arthritis in patients whose symptoms have not resolved while on antimalarials <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> NSAIDs. Based upon our clinical experience, we usually initiate therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 5 to <span class=\"nowrap\">20&nbsp;mg/day,&nbsp;depending</span> upon the severity of joint inflammation and upon the minimal dose required to obtain initial control. However, patients with concomitant systemic flares may require higher doses of glucocorticoids to control other disease manifestations. If courses of glucocorticoids longer than two to four weeks are required to control isolated arthritis symptoms, an alternative immunosuppressive therapy or DMARD should be added so that the glucocorticoid can be tapered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H3693989\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For refractory or persistent arthritis, we suggest adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. The dose, side effects, monitoring and other considerations are presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H3981583\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial therapy with methotrexate'</a>). A systematic review of 9 studies (three of which were randomized controlled trials) including SLE patients with predominantly mucocutaneous or arthritis features found that methotrexate use was associated with a significant reduction in disease activity as well as the average dose of glucocorticoids used by patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients unable to tolerate or take methotrexate can try <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> as an alternative unless otherwise contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-dosing-and-adverse-effects-of-leflunomide-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology, dosing, and adverse effects of leflunomide in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with persistent arthritis unresponsive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> after three to six months of therapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> may be substituted for these DMARDs. The efficacy of azathioprine in controlling lupus arthritis is extrapolated from results of rheumatoid arthritis trials. Also, azathioprine has been shown to decrease activity of nonrenal manifestations, which include patients with musculoskeletal manifestations such as arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For persistent arthritis that has not responded to the therapies described above (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>), we may try <a href=\"topic.htm?path=belimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">belimumab</a>. The pivotal controlled trials for belimumab demonstrated improvements in musculoskeletal outcomes in SLE patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Post hoc analyses have further examined the results of these trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>]. Reported benefits decreased musculoskeletal and mucocutaneous involvement, and decreased requirements for glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally avoid using tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors to treat arthritis associated with lupus because of the increased incidence of developing antinuclear antibodies (ANA) or antibodies to double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, as well as other autoimmune diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-induction-of-antibodies-autoantibodies-and-autoimmune-diseases#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: Induction of antibodies, autoantibodies, and autoimmune diseases&quot;, section on 'Autoantibodies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-induction-of-antibodies-autoantibodies-and-autoimmune-diseases#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: Induction of antibodies, autoantibodies, and autoimmune diseases&quot;, section on 'Autoimmune diseases'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with refractory arthritis unresponsive to any of the therapies discussed above, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> may be used. This is largely based on observational studies showing a reduction in disease activity with rituximab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Other biologics also used for the treatment of RA can also improve musculoskeletal manifestations of SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p/><p>Total joint arthroplasty is infrequently required in patients with SLE. In one cohort of 500 patients with SLE followed at a single center in Great Britain, arthritis was present in 94 percent, but only 4 percent (19 patients) underwent at least one total joint replacement between 1978 and 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The findings most often associated with undergoing joint replacement were osteonecrosis and overlapping features of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (in 10 and 11 patients, respectively). An analysis of data from a large hospitalization database in the United States suggested that patients with SLE are at increased risk for postoperative mortality after joint arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBCUTANEOUS NODULES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subcutaneous nodules that occur characteristically in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been noted in 5 to 7 percent of patients with SLE. Nodules are generally seen in association with active disease in patients with disease that resembles RA (eg, rheumatoid factor positivity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,47</a>]. The pathology of these nodules is similar to that of rheumatoid nodules.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">OSTEONECROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteonecrosis (also called avascular, aseptic, or ischemic necrosis) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is most common in the femoral head, although the humeral head, tibial plateau, and scaphoid navicular can also be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,48-50</a>]. Osteonecrosis is usually bilateral and is often asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, femoral head involvement usually manifests as pain in the groin, especially with weightbearing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Osteonecrosis has been reported in 3 to 40 percent of patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. This wide range reflects the use of different techniques in defining this disorder, from the less sensitive plain film radiography to the very sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); variations in glucocorticoid dosing; and different periods of follow-up. As an example, one report followed 228 patients with SLE for a mean period of 31 months. Nine percent had osteonecrosis, and it was estimated that the frequency would rise to 30 percent at 10 to 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, among 744 patients with SLE followed a mean of eight years, 13 percent developed osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Disease activity as measured by system lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) scoring is a major risk factor for the development of osteonecrosis in early SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Early lesions are detectable by MRI, while plain radiography only detects late lesions. Most lesions on plain radiography develop four to seven years after the diagnosis of SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. If one suspects osteonecrosis based upon clinical symptoms and if a hip radiograph is negative, a MRI may be diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. We usually perform a MRI only in patients with suggestive symptoms (eg, hip or groin pain). If the MRI is negative, a bone scan may occasionally detect an early lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. If these tests are equivocal, the diagnosis may be established by an abnormal intraosseous phlebogram and by the demonstration of an elevated intramedullary pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteonecrosis begins by interruption of blood supply to the bone. Subsequently, the adjacent area becomes hyperemic, resulting in demineralization, trabecular thinning, and, if stressed, collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with SLE who have taken glucocorticoids are at greatest risk, although occasional cases have been noted in the absence of glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Osteonecrosis often develops a relatively short time after the onset of glucocorticoid therapy, within a month in some patients who receive high doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/49,57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,57-60</a>]. One prospective study, for example, evaluated 60 patients with SLE over a period of five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In that study, patients who had no MRI abnormalities in the femoral head during the first year of follow-up were unlikely to develop osteonecrosis at a later date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Glucocorticoid dose and duration of therapy seem to be important factors in the development of osteonecrosis, although there is some controversy about this issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/49,52,55,57-59,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,52,55,57-59,62,63</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other risk factors for osteonecrosis have also been suggested. The Raynaud phenomenon and hyperlipidemia were associated in one retrospective series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] but not in a larger study of 744 patients followed for an average of 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In the latter study, the presence of arthritis, use of glucocorticoids, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cytotoxic medication were associated with a significantly increased risk of osteonecrosis. Cytotoxic treatment was also identified in a prospective study of 571 patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Those who had a BMD measurement tended to have more traditional risk factors for osteoporosis (eg, age, postmenopausal status), to have higher lupus disease activity, to more frequently have renal involvement, to have evidence of increased end-organ damage, and to have higher use of glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressives. Among the women whose BMDs were measured, 18 percent had osteoporosis, and 49 percent had osteopenia. Low bone density was associated with increasing age and a higher amount of lupus-related end-organ damage but was not associated with disease activity or glucocorticoid use. The lack of an association with glucocorticoid use in this study was surprising and unexplained. However, the absence of an association with glucocorticoid use and a significant link to SLE-associated damage have been corroborated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].</p><p>Other risk factors for osteoporosis include smoking, physical inactivity, chronic systemic inflammation, and premature gonadal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

Morning stiffness is usually brief, and pain may exceed objective physical findings.
