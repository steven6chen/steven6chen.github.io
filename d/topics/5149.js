Most liver cysts are found incidentally on imaging studies and tend to have a benign course. A minority can cause symptoms and rarely may be associated with serious morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Larger cysts are more likely to be symptomatic and cause complications such as spontaneous hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], rupture into the peritoneal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] or bile duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and compression of the biliary tree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. Specific types of cysts may have unique complications such as malignant transformation in the case of a mucinous cystic neoplasm (cystadenoma), or anaphylactic shock due to a hydatid cyst. Some of these complications may occasionally mandate surgical intervention.</p><p>In some cases, predominantly cystic liver lesions may have solid areas, particularly in the setting of malignancy. Conversely, predominantly solid liver lesions may have cystic components, as may be seen with hemangiomas or tumors that have areas that are necrotic. </p><p>Considerable controversy still exists regarding the definition and classification of cystic lesions of the liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58989 \">table 1</a>). Furthermore, consensus has not been achieved on the optimal treatment of patients with symptomatic cysts, although a number of therapeutic approaches have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This topic review will provide an overview of the diagnosis and management of cystic lesions in the liver. Detailed discussions on some of the individual causes of cysts are provided in the corresponding topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SIMPLE CYST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple cysts of the liver are cystic formations containing clear fluid that do not communicate with the intrahepatic biliary tree. Although simple cysts are found in approximately 1 percent of autopsied adults, very few become large, and even fewer cause symptoms. Their size ranges from a few millimeters to massive lesions occupying large volumes of the upper abdomen; the largest reported cyst contained 17 liters of fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Simple cysts tend to occur more commonly in the right lobe and are more prevalent in women. The female-to-male ratio is approximately 1.5:1 among those with asymptomatic simple cysts, while it is 9:1 in those with symptomatic or complicated simple cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Huge cysts are found almost exclusively in women over 50.</p><p>Symptomatic patients may present with abdominal discomfort, pain, or nausea. As a general rule, cysts in symptomatic patients are larger than those in asymptomatic ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. Large cysts can produce atrophy of the adjacent hepatic tissue, while huge cysts can cause complete atrophy of a hepatic lobe with compensatory hypertrophy of the other lobe. Complications (such as spontaneous hemorrhage, bacterial infection, torsion of pedunculated cyst, rupture, or biliary obstruction) are more common in large cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/2-6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distinction between a simple cyst, a mucinous cystic neoplasm (with or without invasive carcinoma), an echinococcal cyst, and other rare primary or metastatic tumors can be difficult. However, the distinction is extremely important, since these lesions have different clinical significance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography is probably the most helpful initial test, since it can usually differentiate a simple cyst from other cystic lesions. It should also be used for follow-up studies. Simple cysts appear as an anechoic unilocular fluid-filled space with imperceptible walls and with posterior acoustic enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Clinical features combined with the sonographic findings are usually sufficient to distinguish simple cysts from other lesions that can appear cystic, such as a liver abscess, necrotic malignant tumor, hemangioma, and hamartoma.</p><p>On a computed tomography scan, a simple cyst is defined as a well-demarcated water-attenuation lesion that does not enhance following the administration of intravenous contrast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68739\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68739 \">image 1</a>). Uncomplicated simple cysts are virtually never septated. However, hemorrhage into a simple cyst can lead to confusion in the sonographic differentiation between a simple cyst and a mucinous cystic neoplasm (with or without invasive carcinoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]. In one report, hemorrhage was associated with the appearance of septa in 2 of 57 patients (3.5 percent) with large simple cysts (&ge;4 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Hemorrhage is much less frequent in smaller cysts.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates a well-defined water-attenuation lesion that does not enhance following the administration of intravenous Gadolinium. On T1-weighted images the cyst shows a low signal, whereas a very high intensity signal is shown on T2-weighted images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68739\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68739 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of a simple cyst includes a variety of hepatic lesions that can have a cystic appearance, such as a mucinous cystic neoplasm (with or without invasive carcinoma), a hepatic abscess, a necrotic malignant tumor, a hemangioma, and a hamartoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72463\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72463 \">table 2</a>). As mentioned above, the distinction can usually be made based upon the clinical setting and radiographic findings. A rare exception is a hepatic metastasis from a neuroendocrine tumor, which can be asymptomatic and can have a sharply defined necrotic area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Histology and needle aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histological examination is seldom needed for establishing the diagnosis. However, when histology is available, the following criteria can be used for a definitive diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An outer layer of a thin, dense fibrous tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An inner epithelial lining consisting of a single layer of cuboidal or columnar epithelium; this layer is found in most, but not in all, simple cysts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of mesenchymal stroma or cellular atypia</p><p/><p>Aspiration is usually not required for diagnosing cysts that have a typical sonographic appearance. When it is performed, the aspirated fluid is always sterile and cytologically negative. It may vary from a clear straw color to brown. High levels of carcinoembryonic antigen in the cyst fluid have been reported in mucinous cystic neoplasms with associated invasive carcinoma, but the diagnostic accuracy of this finding has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1050260664\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of asymptomatic simple cysts do not require treatment. However, it may be prudent to monitor large cysts (&ge;4 cm in diameter) periodically with ultrasonography to assure that they remain stable. For these patients, we suggest an initial follow-up study in three months after the diagnosis and then again at 6 to 12 months. Further monitoring is usually unnecessary if the cyst remains unchanged for two to three years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1687487990\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of symptoms related to the cyst or increasing size should raise concern that the lesion could be a mucinous cystic neoplasm (with or without invasive carcinoma) or another rare cystic neoplasm, since simple cysts tend to remain stable in size. Such patients may require surgical intervention. The causal relationship between abdominal pain or discomfort and a simple cyst must be admitted with caution and accepted only if the cyst is large and other possible causes of the symptoms have been excluded. These include cholelithiasis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastric dysmotility, peptic ulcer disease, and other causes of dyspepsia. Percutaneous aspiration has been advocated as a diagnostic test for relief of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, this test is not without risk and has not been widely accepted.</p><p>Several therapeutic approaches have been described for symptomatic, large simple cysts, including needle aspiration with or without injection of sclerosing agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>], internal drainage with cystojejunostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], wide unroofing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>], and varying degrees of liver resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In most series, percutaneous needle aspiration was associated with a high failure rate and rapid recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Percutaneous needle aspiration with injection of sclerosing agents such as alcohol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> hydrochloride, and others is generally safe, effective, and relatively noninvasive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]; however, it may occasionally have serious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Wide unroofing or cyst resection has been associated with a relatively low incidence of cyst recurrence or complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/16,24-26,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24-26,35,36</a>]. The laparoscopic approach has proven to be safe, achieving a wide unroofing or resection without the need for a debilitating incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/16,26,27,29,36-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26,27,29,36-42</a>].</p><p>Several centers have reported recurrence rates ranging from 0 to 14.3 percent, and morbidity rates of 0 to 15 percent, after laparoscopic unroofing of solitary simple cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/26,37-39,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,37-39,43</a>]. Potential complications of laparoscopic unroofing include wound infection, chest infection, bile leak, subphrenic hematoma, and prolonged postoperative drainage through abdominal drain (more than three days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/26,27,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27,39</a>]. Laparoscopic unroofing may not be possible in patients with a superior or posterior location of the cyst. There are no prospective studies comparing the different therapeutic approaches. As a result the procedure of choice should be decided on a case by case basis, taking into consideration the cyst's location, suspicion of malignancy, history of abdominal surgery, and local expertise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">NONINVASIVE MUCINOUS CYSTIC NEOPLASM (CYSTADENOMA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs; previously referred to as cystadenomas) are rare cystic tumors that occur within the liver parenchyma, or less frequently, in the extrahepatic bile ducts. The published experience with these lesions is limited to single case reports and small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/16,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,44-46</a>]. These reports suggest that MCNs occur in adults and more often in women. The tumors occurred more often in the right lobe than in the left in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], while two other series reported frequent involvement of the left lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/16,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,45</a>]. The tumors grew to a large size and required surgical intervention in most reports.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly reported presenting symptoms were a sensation of an upper abdominal mass, abdominal discomfort or pain, and anorexia. These symptoms had been present for several years prior to diagnosis in several patients. However, many patients were asymptomatic, and the lesions were found incidentally on abdominal imaging studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic examination is required for definitive diagnosis, although the lesion may be suspected on imaging studies. The differential diagnosis includes MCN with an associated invasive carcinoma (cystadenocarcinoma), echinococcal cyst, and a simple cyst. Simple cysts can usually be distinguished because of the absence of septations and papillary projections and the presence of serous cystic fluid. Echinococcal cysts are frequently associated with calcifications, and patients will have positive serology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-echinococcosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of echinococcosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appearance of an MCN on ultrasonography can usually differentiate it from a simple cyst (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66639\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66639 \">picture 1</a>). On ultrasonography, an MCN typically appears as a hypoechoic lesion with thickened, irregular walls and occasional internal echoes representing debris and wall nodularity. These findings are generally indicative of a complicated cyst, which may represent a simple cyst with previous bleeding, a neoplastic cyst such as an MCN (with or without invasive carcinoma), or rarely, a metastasis. On a computed tomography scan, an MCN appears as a low attenuation mass, which may be uni- or multilocular or may have septations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66639\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66639 \">picture 1</a>). The cyst wall is usually thickened <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> irregular. This is in contrast to a simple cyst, which is typically devoid of septations and has imperceptible walls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An MCN is usually a multilocular cystic lesion with a smooth external surface and a thin wall with smooth internal lining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. The cyst frequently contains blood or chocolate-colored material. Histology is essential for the diagnosis and is usually obtained during or after resection of a suspicious cyst. Microscopically, MCNs are lined by biliary-type mucus-secreting cuboidal or columnar epithelium, supported by dense cellular (mesenchymal) fibrous stroma resembling ovarian tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66639\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66639 \">picture 1</a>). The lining is surrounded by a loose and less cellular layer of collagen. It has been suggested that MCNs may be composed of two distinct groups that differ in the presence or absence of a mesenchymal stroma surrounding the epithelial lining of the cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors#H1048093954\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of malignant liver tumors&quot;, section on 'Mucinous cystic neoplasms (biliary cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferred treatment for noninvasive MCNs is resection, which should be performed whenever possible, since malignant transformation of the cyst lining has been described in as many as 15 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Removal of the cyst can be accomplished by enucleating it from the surrounding liver. Partial excision is invariably associated with recurrence and with worse prognosis compared with complete resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/26,29,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29,35</a>]. Aspiration is also associated with rapid recurrence of fluid and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A hepatic resection should be considered whenever a cystic lesion is suspected of containing invasive carcinoma, since reliable differentiation between noninvasive MCNs and MCNs with associated invasive carcinoma is not always possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">MUCINOUS CYSTIC NEOPLASM WITH ASSOCIATED INVASIVE CARCINOMA (CYSTADENOCARCINOMA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) with associated invasive carcinoma (previously referred to as cystadenocarcinomas) are usually found in older adults, although they have been reported in patients in their thirties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. While the tumors can invade adjacent tissues and metastasize, their prognosis has generally been better than that associated with cholangiocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of localized cholangiocarcinoma: Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining whether an MCN has developed invasive carcinoma can be difficult based upon clinical, radiologic, and histological evidence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69402\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69402 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. MCNs with associated invasive carcinoma are usually multilocular. Malignant changes are typically found in the inner epithelial lining (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69402\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69402 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors#H1048093954\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of malignant liver tumors&quot;, section on 'Mucinous cystic neoplasms (biliary cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma)'</a>.)</p><p>Macroscopically, noninvasive MCNs have a smooth external surface. However, internally, they have varying degrees of thickness in the wall. Infrequently, they may have a thin wall with a smooth lining. MCNs with associated invasive carcinoma generally have a thick wall that may show large tissue masses protruding from the internal cyst lining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. MCNs with associated invasive carcinoma have occasionally been identified preoperatively by aspiration and examination of the contents of the cyst, but this procedure carries a risk of bleeding and peritoneal seeding of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. As noted above, elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen have been reported in cystic fluid aspirated from MCNs with associated invasive carcinoma, but the diagnostic accuracy of this finding is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to noninvasive MCNs, if invasive carcinoma is suspected, treatment should consist of a formal liver resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/48,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,51</a>]. Enucleation is not recommended, since it may be associated with an increased risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The lesion is potentially curable by complete excision. The effect of nonsurgical therapy (eg, radiation or chemotherapy) is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ECHINOCOCCAL CYST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echinococcal (hydatid) cysts of the liver are caused by the larval form of <em>Echinococcus granulosus</em>, which is usually acquired from infected dogs. These are fluid-filled structures limited by a parasite-derived membrane that contains germinal epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60149\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60149 \">figure 1</a>). Hydatid cysts of the liver are uncommonly encountered in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-echinococcosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of echinococcosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients are often asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, they are usually due to the mass effect of an enlarging cyst or complications such as intraperitoneal leakage, infection, or biliary obstruction. <em>E. granulosus</em> cysts can rupture into the biliary tree and produce biliary colic, obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, or pancreatitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic diagnosis and management of biliary parasitosis&quot;</a>). Pressure or mass effects on the bile ducts, portal and hepatic veins, or on the inferior vena cava can result in cholestasis, portal hypertension, venous obstruction, or the Budd-Chiari syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-the-budd-chiari-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of the Budd-Chiari syndrome&quot;</a>). Liver cysts can also rupture into the peritoneum, causing peritonitis, or transdiaphragmatically into the bronchial tree, causing pulmonary hydatidosis or a bronchial fistula. Secondary bacterial infection of the cysts can result in liver abscesses.

Unlike simple solitary cysts, they occur more frequently in men and are found most commonly in the left lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. There are approximately 60 reported cases of ciliated foregut cyst, the size of which ranged from 0.4 to 9.0 cm. There are no reported cases of malignant transformation. The clinical importance of its diagnosis lies in the distinction from other potentially malignant hepatic lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary squamous cell carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several reports of primary squamous cell carcinoma arising in hepatic cysts lined predominantly by stratified squamous epithelium. These lesions appear to have a poor prognosis, although the information in the literature is sparse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, certain liver metastases may appear as cystic lesions, usually due to the occurrence of central necrosis. These include metastases from ovarian carcinoma, pancreas, colon, kidney, and neuroendocrine tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Polycystic liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polycystic liver disease most often occurs in patients with polycystic kidney disease. The incidence of hepatic cysts in polycystic kidney disease increases with age from approximately 10 percent below the age of 30 to greater than 50 percent over the age of 60. The cysts, which appear to be derived from biliary epithelium, are more commonly observed in patients with advanced renal disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrarenal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Hepatic cysts'</a>.)</p><p>A less common disorder, autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease, is distinct from polycystic kidney disease, since it is not associated with kidney involvement or cerebral aneurysms. Two mutations have been found to cause this disorder: a mutation in the <em>PRKCSH </em>gene that encodes a protein called hepatocystin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], and a mutation in the <em>SEC63</em> gene that encodes for a component of the protein translocation machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Biliary cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary cysts are cystic dilatations that may occur singly or in multiples throughout the bile ducts. They were originally termed choledochal cysts (involving the extrahepatic bile duct), but the clinical classification was revised in 1977 to include intrahepatic cysts. Infants with biliary cysts commonly present with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (80 percent), failure to thrive, or an abdominal mass (30 to 60 percent). The triad of pain, jaundice, and abdominal mass is found in 11 to 63 percent. In contrast, chronic and intermittent abdominal pain appears to be the most common presenting symptom (50 to 96 percent) in patients older than two. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-cysts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary cysts&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1135986966\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrahepatic cysts presenting as hepatic cystic lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In rare cases, extrahepatic cysts, which are adjacent to the liver (eg, adrenal, renal or mesenteric cystic lesions) may closely mimic hepatic cysts and may be difficult to differentiate from the latter without a surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-cystic-lesions-of-the-liver/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystic lesions of the liver may pose a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Simple cysts are the most common lesions encountered. Clinical features combined with typical sonographic findings are usually sufficient to distinguish simple cysts from other cystic lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58989 \">table 1</a>). Needle aspiration is usually not required for diagnosis. On the other hand, certain clinical and radiologic features should raise suspicion for an alternative diagnosis such as mucinous cystic neoplasm (with or without invasive carcinoma) or hydatid cyst (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72463\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72463 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Simple cyst'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with large (&ge;4 cm in diameter), asymptomatic, simple cysts should be monitored with periodic ultrasonography. For these patients, we suggest an initial follow-up study in three months after the diagnosis, and then again at 6 to 12 months. Further monitoring is usually unnecessary if the cyst remains unchanged for two to three years. (See <a href=\"#H1050260664\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The procedure of choice for symptomatic simple cysts is laparoscopic wide unroofing, which is usually curative. Percutaneous aspiration is ineffective and should be avoided. Prior to surgery, echinococcal cysts should be ruled out. On opening the cyst roof, close inspection of the interior for neoplastic components is extremely important. Any suspicion regarding underlying malignancy (eg, solid or thickened cyst wall, nodules, etc.) mandates a biopsy for frozen section histopathology. (See <a href=\"#H1687487990\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enucleation may be sufficient for noninvasive mucinous cystic neoplasms, whereas formal hepatic resection is indicated for mucinous cystic neoplasms with associated invasive carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive mucinous cystic neoplasm (cystadenoma)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Mucinous cystic neoplasm with associated invasive carcinoma (cystadenocarcinoma)'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Benhamou JP, Menu Y.
