The evacuated air is seen as bubbling through the water seal of the drainage device. Air may continue to leak into the pleural space for minutes to hours, but it will eventually stop in most cases. The bubbling ceases once the lung is fully reinflated and no further air leaks into the pleural space.</p><p>A bronchopleural fistula (BPF) exists if the bubbling continues for 24 hours or more. It is indicative of a persistent air leak into the pleural space. Most are small and consist of only a few bubbles escaping through the water seal of the drainage device in synchrony with the inspiratory phase of the ventilator. However, a few leaks are larger and persist through both inspiration and expiration; the volume of such leaks may reach several hundred milliliters per breath.</p><p>Although BPF was encountered not infrequently 30 years ago in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in the current era of low tidal volumes and lung-protective ventilation it has become rare as a complication associated with mechanical ventilation. Nonetheless, it remains desirable for clinicians caring for critically ill patients to be familiar with BPF and to have an approach to its assessment and management. </p><p>Assessment and management of a BPF in the setting of mechanical ventilation are reviewed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The pathogenesis, management, and outcomes of BPF following lung surgery are discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sequelae-and-complications-of-pneumonectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sequelae and complications of pneumonectomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung volume reduction surgery in COPD&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many potential causes of bronchopleural fistula (BPF) in mechanically ventilated patients. These include airway disruption or alveolar rupture prior to the initiation of mechanical ventilation (eg, trauma, surgery), laceration of the airway or visceral pleura during mechanical ventilation (eg, central line placement, thoracentesis), and spontaneous alveolar rupture (eg, a complication of the underlying disease or mechanical ventilation). The potential causes of BPF are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79654\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79654 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Alveolar rupture due to mechanical ventilation appears to be a consequence of alveolar overdistension due to an excessive inflation volume, more than a consequence of increased airway pressure. This was shown by an animal study in which a high peak inflation volume without increased airway pressure caused alveolar injury, whereas high airway pressure without an increased inflation volume did not cause alveolar injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The former conditions were created by high tidal volume external negative-pressure ventilation, while the latter conditions were created by strapping the chest and not allowing it to expand despite high inflation pressure. These data are also supported by the observation that humans frequently have high airway pressures (eg, coughing, bronchospasm without air trapping), but alveolar rupture rarely results. In light of this evidence, the term &quot;volutrauma&quot; is a more accurate description of the pathogenesis of a pneumothorax as a complication of mechanical ventilation than &quot;barotrauma&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The likelihood of volutrauma is increased in the presence of conditions of lung injury, most notably ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis, management, and prevention of pulmonary barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While volume is probably the major factor in the development of a BPF, a large transpulmonary pressure gradient (ie, the difference in the airway and pleural pressures) may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This may seem to contradict the observation above that high airway pressures are common but alveolar rupture seldom results. The difference is that high airway pressures are usually associated with a high pleural pressure (eg, coughing), so the transpulmonary pressure gradient remains small. However, if airway pressures increase and the pleural pressure remains low, a large transpulmonary pressure gradient develops that can contribute to alveolar rupture.</p><p>Following development of a BPF, additional factors, beyond mechanical ventilation and acute lung pathology, may contribute to a persistent air leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Risk factors for prolonged air leak are mainly described in patients after cardiothoracic surgery, and include older age, smoking history, underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severely impaired spirometry, chronic corticosteroid use, diabetes mellitus, and poor nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. Similar risk factors for persistent BPF have not been clearly identified in the general mechanical ventilation population, but may contribute to the duration of air leak in some cases. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We advocate the following approach to prevent ventilator-associated pneumothorax and bronchopleural fistula (BPF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74558\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74558 \">table 2</a>). This approach is based upon the physiological data described in the previous section and clinical reasoning, which suggest that minimizing the tidal volume and plateau airway pressure during mechanical ventilation may reduce alveolar overdistention, the transpulmonary pressure gradient, alveolar rupture, pneumothorax, and BPF. Data from randomized trials have not shown that lung-protective ventilation decreases the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumothorax and BPF, but such evidence is limited by imprecise estimates due to the paucity of events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>For all mechanically ventilated patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor for the development of intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (ie, auto-PEEP), particularly in patients with known obstructive lung disease.

Decrease the level of applied PEEP if the static respiratory system compliance decreases as the applied PEEP is increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Separate the patient from mechanical ventilation as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>For patients at high risk for alveolar rupture (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], underlying obstructive lung disease, cavitary pulmonary disease):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use tidal volumes &le;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of predicted body weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use applied PEEP cautiously.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use extreme care when inserting a subclavian or internal jugular central venous catheter, or performing thoracentesis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASURING THE LEAK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The size of the air leak through a bronchopleural fistula (BPF) can be quantified precisely using either a pneumotachograph or a water-filled spirometer (ie, devices for recording the rate of airflow to and from the lungs) placed between the chest tube and the drainage device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A heated-wire or spinning-vane type of spirometer should NOT be used. Such quantification of the volume of the air leak is not necessary outside of the research setting because it does not influence clinical management. Most modern ventilators also measure inspired and expired volume separately and as a result can quantify the leak as either an absolute volume or a percentage of the delivered tidal volume.</p><p>An alternative, semi-quantitative method for measuring air leak has also been described in patients after pulmonary resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In these studies of non-ventilated patients, the air-leak meter on the Pleur-Evac system was used to quantify leaks on a scale of one to seven, based on the highest-number chamber reached by bubbles with deep breathing or coughing. A score of four or greater was predictive of failure of waterseal. To our knowledge, there are no similar studies describing a similar approach in the general mechanical ventilation population with BPF. </p><p>In routine practice, the severity of the air leak can be generally stratified into three levels (from least to most severe):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bubbling during inspiration only</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bubbling during both inspiration and expiration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bubbling during both inspiration and expiration, as well as a detectable difference in the inspired and expired tidal volumes</p><p/><p>The last category suggests that there is an air leak greater than 100 to 150 mL per breath following an appropriate correction for compressible volume. Although BPFs can theoretically cause hypercapnia due to loss of alveolar ventilation through the air leak, this is rare in clinical practice. This is probably because the leaked gas participates in gas exchange rather than being lost or wasted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Intractable respiratory acidosis and other serious complications are more likely due to the lung disease than the BPF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1780997\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goals of bronchopleural fistula (BPF) management include treating the underlying lung disease, general supportive measures including optimizing nutrition, and reducing the air leak through ventilator adjustments to minimize the tidal volume and plateau airway pressure. There is no moderate or high quality evidence that indicates that decreasing the air leak in this manner improves mortality or other clinical outcomes, but elimination or reduction of contributing factors makes it less likely that a new pneumothorax will develop or that the BPF will worsen and become physiologically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/1,2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1406320\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilator management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a BPF, the ventilator should be adjusted to minimize both tidal volume and the plateau airway pressure, thereby minimizing alveolar distension and the transpulmonary pressure gradient, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66471\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66471 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the number of full ventilator-delivered breaths.

When such adjustments are not possible or insufficient, a strategy of permissive hypercapnia is appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permissive-hypercapnia-during-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permissive hypercapnia during mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;</a>.) The rationale for applying a lower amount of chest tube suction if possible is that suction may increase air flow through the BPF, thus preventing spontaneous healing and cessation of the air leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Reports have described the use of alternative modes of mechanical ventilation, including independent lung ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>], high-frequency ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>], or airway pressure release ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], along with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], when severe BPF persisted despite the conservative measures noted above, but there is no moderate or high quality evidence to suggest that these strategies are effective.
