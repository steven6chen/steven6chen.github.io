In addition, splenic function is reduced in the neonate and may be abnormally reduced (ie, hyposplenism or functional asplenia) when the spleen is engorged with blood (eg, splenic sequestration crisis associated with sickle cell disease, malaria, splenic vein thrombosis) or infiltrated (eg, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, tumors, or cysts). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Asplenic patients and those with impaired splenic function are at risk for a fulminant sepsis syndrome, usually due to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. The importance of the spleen for clearance of bacteria and humoral immune response, conditions leading to asplenia, clinical manifestations of infection in the asplenic patient, and the management of postsplenectomy sepsis will be reviewed here. The terms &quot;postsplenectomy sepsis&quot; and &quot;asplenic sepsis&quot; are largely interchangeable, since the functional defects are the same regardless of whether the causative process is congenital or acquired. In this topic review, we will use the term &quot;asplenic sepsis&quot; to include all asplenic patients.</p><p>The prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF THE SPLEEN IN HOST DEFENSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sinusoids of the spleen serve as a &quot;fine tooth comb&quot; to filter blood through a series of capillaries as small as 1 micron in diameter to sequester senescent, rigid erythrocytes from the circulation. The mononuclear phagocytes located within this capillary network also ingest circulating bacteria, particularly unopsonized organisms, thus cleansing the roughly 6 percent of cardiac output that perfuses the spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The spleen also serves as the largest lymphoid organ within the body and contains nearly half of the body's total immunoglobulin-producing B lymphocytes. Thus, the spleen not only clears bacteria from the circulation but also processes this foreign material to stimulate the production of opsonizing antibody. This function is particularly important in the clearance of encapsulated organisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF IMPAIRED SPLENIC FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired splenic function can result from splenic disease (hyposplenism) or, more commonly, splenectomy.

The incidence of this syndrome is highest in children who undergo splenectomy in infancy and in splenectomized lymphoma patients who have received combined modality therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The incidence of sepsis has been estimated to be approximately 1 per 175 patient-years in children and 1 per 400 to 500 patient-years among adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, a later study found a rate of 1 per 14 patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Such aggregate data do not stratify risk as a function of underlying disorder and associated immunodeficiency. Although underlying immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and underlying malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] are associated with an increased risk of postsplenectomy sepsis, asplenic sepsis can occur in otherwise healthy asplenic adults, and the risk of infection persists indefinitely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A report describing two episodes of overwhelming <em>S. pneumoniae</em> sepsis in asplenic mothers within one year of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] may reflect increased exposure to <em>S. pneumoniae</em> in this population and calls attention to the importance of maintaining appropriate immunizations among women of childbearing age.</p><p>The highest risk of sepsis occurs during the first few years following splenectomy but has been documented as late as 20 years after splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/6,8,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,13-17</a>]. In a population-based cohort study, the risk of infection requiring hospital contact was highest during the 90 days following splenectomy, occurring in 10 percent of individuals who had undergone splenectomy compared with 0.6 percent in the general population (adjusted odds ratio 18.1, 95% CI 14.8 to 22.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In comparison, hazard of infection was 4.6-fold higher from 91 to 365 days following splenectomy and 2.5-fold higher &gt;365 days following splenectomy compared with the general population. The fraction of bacteremic episodes due to pneumococci in splenectomized patients, most of whom were adults with a high burden of comorbid conditions, was surprisingly low (&lt;5 percent); the frequency of fulminant sepsis complicating bacteremia due to nonencapsulated pathogens was not reported.</p><p>Similar risks of postsplenectomy infection were noted in a review of 288 patients who had undergone splenectomy: one-third of first infections occurred within the first year of surgery and just over half within two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. One-third of all pneumococcal infections occurred at least five years after splenectomy. Among survivors of an initial episode of severe sepsis in another series, the risk of subsequent severe infection was increased more than sixfold, and the risk of a third episode among survivors of two severe infections was further increased more than twofold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Patients who undergo posttraumatic splenectomy are thought to retain variable degrees of splenic function postoperatively and may have a reduced risk of subsequent sepsis. However, experimental studies suggest that regenerated splenic tissue is histologically and functionally abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], thus offering limited protection against sepsis. Splenic angioembolization is often utilized in the management of patients with moderate splenic injury to avoid splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients who have undergone this procedure may subsequently demonstrate Howell-Jolly bodies on peripheral blood smears (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60588\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60588 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], a sign of splenic hypofunction indicating an increased risk of asplenic sepsis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">BACTERIAL PATHOGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fulminant sepsis in asplenic patients is classically caused by encapsulated organisms, including <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>.</p><p>The single most important pathogen is <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. In a review of 349 episodes of sepsis in patients with anatomic or functional asplenia, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> accounted for 57 percent of infections and 59 percent of deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This high rate of pneumococcal infection in asplenic individuals has persisted over recent decades; a German intensive care unit registry confirmed invasive <em>S. pneumoniae</em> infection among nearly 60 percent of etiologically confirmed cases between 2011 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There is no suggestion that any particular serotype of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> is more common in sepsis cases in asplenic patients when compared with other forms of invasive <em>S. pneumoniae</em> infections.</p><p><em>H. influenzae</em> and <em>N. meningitidis</em> made up a much smaller proportion of the infections seen in asplenic sepsis. In the same series of 349 patients, only 22 episodes of sepsis were caused by <em>H. influenzae</em>, with a mortality rate of 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Furthermore, most of these cases occurred in children prior to the availability of the <em>H. influenzae</em> vaccine. <em>N. meningitidis</em> infections occurred in only 13 patients. The small number of cases of <em>N. meningitidis</em> may reflect the low incidence of this infection in the general population. Others have questioned whether splenectomy truly increases the risk of acquiring this pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Anatomic or functional asplenia has also been identified as a risk factor for infection related to other uncommon gram-negative pathogens. Fulminant sepsis in asplenic patients has been caused by <em>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</em> (formerly known as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] group DF-2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], which is almost exclusively observed after close contact with dogs (bites, scratches, or even saliva exposure). <em>Bordetella holmesii</em> is associated with bacteremia, endocarditis, and respiratory illness, mainly in immunocompromised hosts. Of the 30 cases described by the CDC, 85 percent of those with available clinical histories were asplenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF OTHER INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to bacterial infection, anatomic or functional asplenia is also a risk factor for severe infection with other pathogens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Parasitic infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In malaria and babesiosis, the spleen sequesters infected erythrocytes from the circulation through a combination of both nonimmune (loss of erythrocyte deformability) and immune (antibody-coated erythrocytes) mechanisms.</p><p>Splenectomy is an important risk factor for severe babesiosis and should lead to prompt initiation of therapy when babesiosis is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Nonimmune asplenic individuals infected with <em>Plasmodium falciparum </em>may have a delayed response to appropriate therapy, with persistent fever and parasitemia due to the loss of splenic filtration. In contrast, immune individuals who are reinfected following splenectomy appear to have a typical mild course of infection, suggesting that the spleen is not required for the immune sequestration of infected erythrocytes. However, severe cases of falciparum malaria with high levels of parasitemia were reported in two splenectomized patients from French Guiana, leading to death in one subject [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Ehrlichiosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent and prolonged fever has been described in two asplenic patients with human granulocytic ehrlichiosis in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Administration of antibiotics should <strong>not</strong> be delayed in order to perform diagnostic studies, including lumbar puncture.

Although it is optimal to desensitize patients with a history of an immunoglobulin E&ndash;mediated (anaphylactic) reaction to beta-lactams who require therapy with this antimicrobial class, an alternative regimen must be used while the desensitization is being performed. Furthermore, the decision of whether to desensitize a patient should be based on the Gram stain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> culture data, the latter of which can take several days to yield an organism.

Limited experimental studies have suggested a protective effect of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) in asplenic pneumococcal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Although the efficacy of IVIG for asplenic sepsis has not been investigated in clinical trials, some experts recommend its administration in this situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. We agree that it is reasonable to give IVIG to asplenic patients with hemodynamic instability or disseminated intravascular coagulation regardless of underlying immunodeficiency or immunization status, asplenic patients with group A streptococcal infection, patients with underlying immunodeficiency and asplenic sepsis, or patients with asplenic sepsis who are otherwise immunocompetent but whose immunization status against <em>S. pneumoniae</em> cannot be verified. The regimen proposed for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> on day 1, followed by 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> on days 2 and 3) is reasonable in these patients.
