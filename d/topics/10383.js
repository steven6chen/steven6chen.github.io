In addition, women are generally underrepresented in cardiovascular randomized studies and data suggest that women are not referred as often as men for appropriate therapeutic procedures in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>The success rate of therapy for CHD is similar in women and men; however, the complication rates differ, resulting in a sex specific profile of benefit. Although unadjusted outcomes with therapies such as an early invasive strategy in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes, and fibrinolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in ST-elevation myocardial infarction, are often worse in women than men, these differences are almost entirely due to confounding risk factors (eg, older age, more diabetes, more hypertension), not female sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p>The management of CHD in women will be reviewed here.

However, in women, the benefit of early invasive therapy appears to be more nuanced. A meta-analysis of contemporary trials suggested that while an early invasive strategy had a survival benefit in men, there was no such benefit in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, when the subgroup of women with elevated troponin levels was examined, a clear benefit in six-month outcomes emerged (adjusted odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.26-0.83) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A subsequent meta-analysis of eight trials, with over 3000 women and over 7000 men, found that an early invasive strategy had a similar benefit in high-risk (biomarker-positive) women as it did in men, but that benefit could not be shown for lower-risk (biomarker-negative) women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>In practice, women with a NSTEACS are treated less aggressively than men. In a review from the CRUSADE National Quality Improvement Initiative of almost 36,000 such patients (41 percent women), women were treated less aggressively than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. They were significantly less likely to undergo catheterization within 24 hours of admission (42 versus 49 percent in men) and less likely to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention within this time (44 versus 52 percent). Women had higher rates of in-hospital mortality, reinfarction, and heart failure but, after adjustment, the rates were similar to those in men. Similarly, in an evaluation of all patients with first ACS in Denmark between 2005 and 2011, diagnostic angiography was performed less frequently in women compared with men, both at one day (31 versus 42 percent, p&lt;0.001), and within 60 days (67 versus 80 percent, p&lt;0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">STEMI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) should generally be treated similarly to men.

We believe that our understanding of the optimal dosing of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents in patients with smaller BMI is incomplete.

Although definitive data are not available, it appears that fibrinolysis reduces mortality in acute myocardial infection (MI) by the same proportion in both sexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/5,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,38</a>].

These differences are primarily due to worse baseline characteristics, such as older age and significantly higher rates of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prior heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/5,6,39,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,39,41,42</a>]. There are conflicting data as to whether the increase in mortality disappears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] or persists after correction for these factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/6,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,42</a>]. In a review from GUSTO IIb, for example, there was a nonsignificant trend toward an increased risk of death or infarction at 30 days in women after adjustment for baseline variables (odds ratio 1.27, p = 0.07) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Women have a modestly increased risk of bleeding, including hemorrhagic stroke, after fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/5,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,41</a>]. An additional bleeding concern is the use of fibrinolytic agents in menstruating women. Data on this issue are limited. Among 12 menstruating women in GUSTO-I, there was no significant increase in severe bleeding compared with non-menstruating women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A significant increase in <strong>moderate</strong> bleeding was found that was offset by the benefits of fibrinolytic therapy. Thus, menstruating women should not automatically be excluded from fibrinolytic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary PCI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women undergoing primary PCI have had higher rates of in-hospital and longer-term mortality than men in both retrospective observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>] and subset analyses of randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/41,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,48</a>]. However, as with fibrinolysis, this difference was no longer present on multivariate analysis in almost all of these studies since women tended to be older and have more comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/41,44,46-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,44,46-51</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of these effects was illustrated by a review from the CADILLAC trial, which compared primary stenting with primary angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. At one year, women had significantly higher rates of mortality (7.6 versus 3.0 percent in men), target vessel revascularization (16.7 versus 12.1 percent), and major adverse cardiac events (23.9 versus 15.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These differences were largely due to a higher prevalence of clinical risk factors in women (older age and more frequent diabetes, hypertension, and renal insufficiency) and smaller body size, which may be associated with more frequent procedural complications and perhaps lack of weight adjustment of pharmacologic therapy, especially anticoagulants. After adjustment, female sex was not an independent risk factor for mortality in the CADILLAC trial. </p><p>In a single-center observational study of patients with acute MI treated predominantly with PCI, women had a significantly lower mortality at one year after adjustment for older age and a greater prevalence of diabetes and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. A possible explanation for this finding is a greater benefit from PCI. Support for this hypothesis comes from a study that measured the degree of myocardial salvage after primary PCI in 502 women and 1435 men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The amount of myocardium at risk or initial perfusion defect was similar in women and men (22 and 24 percent of the left ventricle). However, final infarct size, measured on follow-up scintigraphy, was smaller in women, and the percent of myocardium that was salvaged by PCI was greater in women (64 versus 50 percent). Why this might occur is not clear. Contributing factors may include more reactive platelets and therefore a greater response to aggressive antiplatelet therapy and a higher incidence of preinfarction angina, which may limit infarct size by ischemic preconditioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-ischemic-conditioning-clinical-implications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial ischemic conditioning: Clinical implications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Observational studies and subset analyses of randomized trials suggest that women with STEMI (similar to men) have better outcomes with primary PCI than fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/41,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,49</a>]. In an analysis from the GUSTO-IIb trial of patients treated with primary PCI (without stenting) or fibrinolytic therapy, the adjusted odds ratio for reaching a clinical end point at 30 days (death or nonfatal MI or stroke) was significantly lower with primary PCI compared with fibrinolysis with similar benefit as in men (odds ratio 0.69 versus 0.57 in men) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

This was illustrated in a review of over 143,000 Medicare patients who were admitted for an acute myocardial infarction between 1994 and 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Women had significantly lower unadjusted rates of cardiac catheterization (35.7 versus 46.5 percent in men), but this difference largely disappeared with multivariable adjustment (risk-standardized rates 40.3 versus 41.9 percent). There was no difference between men and women with strong indications for catheterization; the lower utilization in women was primarily seen in those with equivocal indications, raising the suggestion of overuse of the procedure in men. In contrast, a study of over 78,000 ST elevation myocardial infarction patients between 2001 and 2006 revealed that women were less likely to receive acute reperfusion therapy with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolytic therapy than men (56.3 versus 73.0 percent, p&lt;0.0001), and this disparity persisted after adjustment for clinical factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Women, after adjustment for baseline differences, have a different pattern of access to revascularization compared with men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. This was well illustrated in a report from the Nationwide Independent Sample in the United States that compared 500,000 men with over 300,000 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The unadjusted prevalence ratio (PR) for women undergoing PCI and coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) was 0.78, 0.76, and 0.74, respectively. However, with adjustment, women were nearly as likely as men to undergo angioplasty or stenting (PR 0.98 and 0.96, respectively); women remained less likely to undergo CABG (PR 0.78). It is unclear whether this represents bias or appropriate medical treatment given the higher mortality of women following CABG.

Although the rate of angiography, PCI, and CABG was significantly lower in women than men (48 versus 61 percent), there were no significant differences in cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke between women and men. However, women were more likely to develop refractory ischemia and to be rehospitalized for chest pain (16.6 versus 13.9 percent).</p><p>This increase in risk was most prominent in women at high risk as determined by the TIMI risk score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-thrombolysis-in-myocardial-infarction-timi-score-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).
