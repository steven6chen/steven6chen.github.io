Psoriatic arthritis is one type of arthritis. It happens most often in children who have a skin condition called psoriasis. Psoriasis causes patches of thick, red skin that are sometimes covered by silver or white scales.</p><p>Sometimes psoriatic arthritis happens in children who don't have the psoriasis rash, but who have family members with psoriasis. Doctors don't know what causes psoriatic arthritis in children.</p><p>The medical terms for this condition are &quot;psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis&quot; and &quot;juvenile psoriatic arthritis.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869667158\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms are not the same in all children. In general, psoriatic arthritis causes joint pain and swelling. Joints that are commonly affected include those in the knees, ankles, hips, wrists, hands, and feet.</p><p>Symptoms also sometimes depend on a child's age. Children younger than 5 or 6 years often have swelling of their fingers or toes. This makes the fingers or toes look like sausages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86794\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86794 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Older children and teens often have joint pain in their back or hips. They also sometimes have swelling in the lower leg or around their ankles. The swelling happens where strong bands of tissue (called tendons and ligaments) attach to bones.</p><p>In addition to joint symptoms, children with psoriatic arthritis sometimes have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A psoriasis rash &ndash; This looks like red, raised patches of skin. These areas are sometimes hard to see because they might be in the hairline or behind the ears.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nail changes &ndash; The nails can look &quot;pitted,&quot; as if they were pricked by a pin. The nail can also come up off the nail bed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye redness &ndash; This is usually painless, but the cause of the redness is a condition called &quot;uveitis,&quot; which can be serious. Uveitis can lead to vision loss, so make sure to mention this symptom to your child's doctor.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869667190\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. To figure out what's causing your child's symptoms, the doctor or nurse will ask about the symptoms and do an exam. He or she might also order:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-rays of the affected joints</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869667228\"><span class=\"h1\">How is psoriatic arthritis in children treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no cure for this condition, but different treatments can help ease and control symptoms. Treatment for psoriatic arthritis is usually long-term. Depending on your child's symptoms and other factors, treatment usually involves 1 or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or &quot;NSAIDs&quot; for short &ndash; NSAIDs are a large group of medicines that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shots of steroid medicines that go into the painful joint &ndash; These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. These steroids help reduce swelling and pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, or &quot;DMARDs&quot; for short &ndash; Some of these include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sulfasalazine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">leflunomide</a>. Others include medicines called &quot;anti-TNF&quot; medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869667243\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything my child can do on his or her own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It is very important for your child to stay active. He or she might want to avoid being active because of pain. But this can make things worse. It can make the muscles weak and the joints stiff. The doctor, nurse, or physical therapist can help figure out which activities and exercises are right for your child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869667258\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child have long-term joint damage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's hard to know, because it depends on many factors. But the best way to help prevent long-term joint damage is to start treatment as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89089816\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriasis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Psoriasis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Uveitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-arthritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Psoriatic arthritis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriasis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Psoriasis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
