In general, clinically progressive CKD (marked by an increase in the serum creatinine) occurs when the stenosis threatens the entire renal mass. Hence, patients with CKD resulting from atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis usually have high-grade stenosis of both renal arteries or stenosis to a solitary functioning kidney.</p><p>However, renal artery stenosis may be an &quot;incidental&quot; finding in patients who have CKD that is caused by a separate disorder (eg, diabetic nephropathy). It can be difficult to distinguish between patients whose disease is induced by renal artery stenosis and those who have an alternative cause of CKD.</p><p>Ischemic nephropathy is discussed in this topic. Determining which hypertensive patients to evaluate for renal artery stenosis, establishing the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, and treatment of patients with unilateral or bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis are presented elsewhere.

Broadly speaking, &quot;ischemic nephropathy&quot; can refer to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) produced by any cause of diminished renal blood flow. In principle, this could include ischemic acute tubular necrosis, intrarenal arterial or capillary obstruction due to vasculitis, coagulation or hemolytic disorders (such as a thrombotic microangiopathy or sickle cell disease), or immune deposits (as with glomerulonephritis).</p><p>However, the term ischemic nephropathy is most commonly applied in patients who have CKD due to partial or complete obstruction of one or more extrarenal arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], usually in patients with atherosclerotic disease. Thus, for the purposes of this review, ischemic nephropathy refers to the progressive loss of GFR resulting from atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.</p><p>Although renal injury can develop in any kidney or kidney region beyond a critically stenotic artery, the injury may not be clinically apparent, largely due to compensatory function of the unaffected contralateral kidney. As noted above, clinically apparent or progressive disease (marked by an increase in the serum creatinine) occurs primarily when the stenosis threatens the entire renal mass. Hence, patients who are diagnosed with ischemic nephropathy usually have high-grade stenosis of both renal arteries or stenosis to a solitary functioning kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4587470\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of renal function in renovascular disease can result from a usually reversible consequence of antihypertensive therapy or can reflect progressive narrowing of the renal arteries <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progressive intrinsic renal disease. Studies in human subjects demonstrate that, despite a moderate reduction in renal perfusion pressure (up to 40 percent) and in renal blood flow (mean 30 percent), glomerular filtration is reduced but tissue oxygenation within the kidney cortex and medulla can adapt without the development of severe hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. As a corollary, such patients can be treated with medical therapy without progressive loss of function or irreversible fibrosis in many cases, sometimes for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>However, more advanced vascular occlusion, corresponding to a 70 to 80 percent narrowing of the renal artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], leads to demonstrable cortical hypoxia that can be measured by blood oxygen level dependent magnetic resonance (BOLD-MR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In animal studies, this tissue hypoxia produces rarefaction of microvessels, as well as activation of inflammatory and oxidative pathways that lead to interstitial fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Several studies suggest that these changes also take place as a result of renal artery stenosis in human kidneys. In one study, for example, inflammatory markers sampled from renal veins of stenotic kidneys correlated strongly with the degree of hypoxia (as measured by BOLD-MR), particularly after correction of the stenosis with angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Inflammatory changes and fibrosis are also evident in human &quot;pressor&quot; kidneys that were removed to treat hypertension in patients with a totally occluded renal artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Although vascular occlusion can initiate these processes, long-standing parenchymal injury characterized by inflammation and fibrosis eventually becomes an irreversible process. At some point, restoring renal blood flow provides no recovery of renal function or clinical benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemic nephropathy is an increasingly recognized disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/1,14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14-19</a>]. However, few prospective studies have examined the incidence or progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among patients with renal artery stenosis. In addition, renal artery revascularization among patients in these studies infrequently produced a meaningful recovery of renal function, which would have supported the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, the true incidence and prevalence of ischemic nephropathy is unclear.</p><p>Various studies have reported that 5 to 22 percent of patients 50 years or older who have advanced CKD have some degree of renal artery stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/15,21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21-26</a>]. However, the renovascular lesions may have been &quot;incidental&quot; in some if not many of these patients. The following examples illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history of ischemic nephropathy was evaluated in a study of 51 patients with angiographically confirmed bilateral renal artery stenosis (defined as 90 percent or greater stenosis to one kidney and 50 percent or greater to the contralateral kidney) who were followed for up to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) declined from 39 to 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> over five years, and 12 percent of patients developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD), although these individuals had advanced disease at baseline (eGFR 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). For various reasons, no patient was revascularized (eg, patient or clinician preference, &quot;unsalvageable&quot; kidneys, patient not suitable for the procedure, or lesion not amenable to the procedure), suggesting that findings may not be applicable to some patients diagnosed with ischemic nephropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, progression of kidney disease may be infrequent in those incidentally discovered to have renal artery stenosis. In a study of 593 patients who underwent angiography for peripheral artery disease, 397 had interpretable &quot;drive by&quot; renal angiograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Of these, 126 had at least moderate (more than a 50 percent) stenosis of one or more renal arteries (38 had bilateral stenosis or stenosis to a single functioning kidney). The mean eGFR among these patients was 58 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. After 10 years, renal function remained stable and no patient developed ESRD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal artery stenosis is a common finding among patients initiating dialysis. This was shown in a study of 80 consecutive patients initiating hemodialysis as a single center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Of the 49 patients who agreed to undergo computerized tomography angiography (CTA), bilateral renal artery stenosis (defined as a 50 percent or greater diameter reduction) was present in eight patients (16 percent). Three of these patients were not known to have renovascular disease and initiated dialysis with unexplained renal failure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two randomized trials comparing percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty with medical therapy alone primarily enrolled patients with CKD at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/6,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,27</a>], although most patients had unilateral rather than bilateral stenosis. The incidence of renal endpoints in these trials (defined either as a 20 percent reduction in creatinine clearance or as a composite of acute kidney injury, ESRD, or renal death) was 19 percent during two to five years of follow-up. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 95 patients undergoing surgical revascularization of totally occluded renal arteries, 49 percent had improved renal function, including some with ESRD who became independent from dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a study of 146 patients who had renal artery stenting, only 45 percent experienced stabilization or improvement of their renal function at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Numerous case reports and selected observational series indicate that patients with rapidly progressive renal failure, usually associated with severe hypertension, can recover kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].

However, changes in measured GFR over time are not always accurately identified by temporal changes in eGFR. During approximately one year of follow-up, the direction of GFR change predicted by estimating equations was discordant with the true direction of GFR change in 28 to 40 percent of patients (depending upon the equation used). This may reflect exaggerated variability of the serum creatinine caused by changes in extracellular fluid volume or systemic blood pressure superimposed upon partial vascular occlusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with clinical manifestations of ischemic nephropathy (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above), a presumptive diagnosis of ischemic nephropathy can be made if there is radiologic documentation of significant stenosis (usually more than 70 percent luminal occlusion) of both renal arteries or of one renal artery to a solitary functioning kidney. Indications and options for radiographic imaging of renal artery stenosis and the interpretation of these tests are presented elsewhere. In general, these imaging tests to diagnose renal artery stenosis are warranted if a corrective procedure would be performed should significant renovascular lesions be identified and should the kidneys appear to be salvageable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As a practical matter, there are two diagnostic elements to consider in patients who could have ischemic nephropathy; these diagnostic elements can impact treatment decisions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Is the vascular occlusive disease posing critical hemodynamic limitation to kidney function?</strong> In general, luminal occlusion of at least 60 to 75 percent is required to limit blood flow and reduce perfusion pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. This degree of stenosis is usually associated with a measurable translesional pressure gradient of 10 to 15 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

None of these factors predict the outcome of revascularization with certainty. Improved and validated methods to evaluate the salvageability of kidney function in this disorder are sorely needed. Some that have been proposed are as follows: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renal resistive index &ndash; Some studies indicate that elevated resistive indices in segmental vessels (above 0.80) measured by duplex ultrasound denote poor prognosis for renal recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] while a low resistive index is a favorable sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trajectory of renal function &ndash; The most consistent predictor of good recovery of kidney function after revascularization has been a recent deterioration of renal function (ie, in the prior six to twelve months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Kidney size &ndash; Very small kidneys (less than 7 cm in longest diameter) are usually considered unlikely to recover after revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Kidney biopsy &ndash; Previous studies suggest that biopsy demonstrating preexisting atheroembolic changes and interstitial fibrosis indicate a limited potential for recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

In a stenotic kidney, apparently normal morphology combined with reduced function may indicate a &quot;hibernating kidney&quot; that could be salvaged with revascularization. </p><p/><p>A definitive diagnosis is not usually made. In practice, confirmation of the diagnosis is based upon stabilization or improvement of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) after successful revascularization. </p><p>While endovascular or surgical revascularization can restore vessel patency and improve blood flow, these procedures are potentially hazardous, particularly within the severely diseased aorta. Potential complications of revascularization include atheroembolic renal disease and contrast nephropathy. In addition, as noted above, restoring blood flow alone may not reverse the renal disease. Hence, the clinical decision to pursue extensive diagnostic studies and renal artery intervention should weigh renal salvageability against comorbid diseases and risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients at risk for bilateral renal artery stenosis are also at risk for other disorders that can present with similar clinical findings but cannot be corrected by surgery or angioplasty; these include hypertensive nephrosclerosis and atheroembolic renal disease.</p><p>Hypertensive nephrosclerosis has a similar clinical presentation to chronic ischemic renal disease: hypertension, slowly progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), an unremarkable urine sediment, and possible evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease.

In general, clinically apparent or progressive CKD (marked by an increase in the serum creatinine) occurs when the stenosis threatens the entire renal mass. Hence, patients with CKD resulting from atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis usually have high-grade stenosis of both renal arteries or stenosis to a solitary functioning kidney. However, renal artery stenosis may be an &quot;incidental&quot; finding in patients who have CKD that is caused by a separate disorder (eg, diabetic nephropathy). It can be difficult to distinguish between patients whose disease is induced by renal artery stenosis and those who have an alternative cause of CKD. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CKD that results from atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is frequently called ischemic nephropathy. Broadly speaking, &quot;ischemic nephropathy&quot; can refer to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) produced by any cause of diminished renal blood flow. However, the term ischemic nephropathy is most commonly applied in patients who have CKD due to partial or complete obstruction of one or more extrarenal arteries, usually in patients with atherosclerotic disease. (See <a href=\"#H4586586\" class=\"local\">'Definition and terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite a moderate reduction in renal perfusion pressure (up to 40 percent) and in renal blood flow (mean 30 percent), glomerular filtration is reduced but tissue oxygenation within the kidney cortex and medulla can adapt without the development of severe hypoxia. However, more advanced vascular occlusion, corresponding to a 70 to 80 percent narrowing of the renal artery, leads to demonstrable cortical hypoxia. In animal studies, this tissue hypoxia produces rarefaction of microvessels, as well as activation of inflammatory and oxidative pathways that lead to interstitial fibrosis. Although vascular occlusion can initiate these processes, long-standing parenchymal injury characterized by inflammation and fibrosis eventually becomes an irreversible process. (See <a href=\"#H4587470\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ischemic nephropathy typically present as follows (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A persistent and progressive reduction in GFR (ie, CKD).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lack of evidence supporting an alternative cause of renal disease, such as an abnormal urinalysis, proteinuria, a paraprotein, or use of a nephrotoxic drug. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Findings that suggest the presence of renovascular disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56130\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56130 \">table 1</a>), for example: severe hypertension that may be treatment resistant, an acute rise in serum creatinine following the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), significant variability of serum creatinine concentration that may be due to changes in volume status, recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> refractory heart failure, and deterioration of renal function after placement of an endovascular aortic stent graft.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In addition, risk factors for atherosclerotic disease are often present, such as hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, and age greater than 50 years. Patients with ischemic nephropathy frequently have coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial disease in other vascular beds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with clinical manifestations of ischemic nephropathy, a presumptive diagnosis of ischemic nephropathy can be made if there is radiologic documentation of significant stenosis of both renal arteries or of one renal artery to a solitary functioning kidney. As a practical matter, there are two diagnostic elements to consider in patients who could have ischemic nephropathy; these diagnostic elements can impact treatment decisions (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the vascular occlusive disease posing critical hemodynamic limitation to kidney function? In general, luminal occlusion of at least 60 to 75 percent is required to limit blood flow and reduce perfusion pressure. This degree of stenosis is usually associated with a measurable translesional pressure gradient of 10 to 15 mmHg. Doppler ultrasound criteria conventionally require peak systolic velocities above 180 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec</span> to identify more than 60 percent luminal occlusion that is verified by pressure gradients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the condition of the kidneys such that restoring renal blood flow is likely to benefit function? The condition of the kidneys can be assessed by considering the renal resistive index, the six-month trajectory of renal function, and the size of the kidneys, or by performing a kidney biopsy (which is not usually done). None of these factors predict the outcome of revascularization with certainty. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A definitive diagnosis is not usually made. In practice, confirmation of the diagnosis is based upon stabilization or improvement of the GFR after successful revascularization. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at risk for bilateral renal artery stenosis are also at risk for other disorders that can present with similar clinical findings but cannot be corrected by surgery or angioplasty, including hypertensive nephrosclerosis and atheroembolic renal disease. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a presumptive diagnosis of ischemic nephropathy is made, patients should receive medical therapy to control their hypertension in addition to routine CKD care and surveillance. Since these individuals have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, they should also be aggressively treated for secondary prevention of cardiovascular morbidity with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, statins, cessation of smoking, and, in patients with diabetes, glycemic control.
