In particular, occult injury to the anal sphincter complex may occur at the time of an otherwise uncomplicated delivery and, if neglected, can contribute to anal and fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Even when recognized and repaired, persistent sphincter dysfunction is considered to be the most common cause of postpartum anal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Evaluation and repair of perineal and other obstetric lacerations, such as labial, sulcal, and periurethral lacerations, will be reviewed here. Repair of episiotomy, although relative uncommonly performed, is also discussed. Postpartum perineal care, management of complications, and the evaluation and management of traumatic vaginal lacerations are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum perineal care and management of complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-female-lower-genital-tract-trauma#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of female lower genital tract trauma&quot;, section on 'Vagina'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The muscles of the female pelvic floor and perineum are shown in the following figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62230\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62230 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74060\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74060 \">figure 2</a>). The perineal body is the central point of the perineum and separates the urogenital triangle from the anal triangle. Within the perineal body are the interlacing fibers of the superficial transverse perineal muscles, bulbocavernosus, and fibers of the external anal sphincter. The anorectal sphincter complex is comprised of two structures with different, but overlapping, roles for maintaining continence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 3</a>). The external anal sphincter (EAS) is a thick, circular, predominantly striated muscle that surrounds the anal orifice, and is responsible for continence of solid and liquid stool, as well as flatus, both at rest and at times of rectal distension. The internal anal sphincter (IAS) lies between the external sphincter and the anal canal and represents a thin condensation of the longitudinal smooth muscle fibers of the colon submucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 3</a>). The IAS extends more than a centimeter above the cephalad margin of the external sphincter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is entirely under involuntary control and contributes to maintaining anal continence at rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The puborectalis portion of the levator ani complex also plays an important role in continence of solid stool. The external anal sphincter is innervated by the pudendal nerve, which may be susceptible to injury during delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1999, Sultan proposed refining the traditional classification system for obstetric perineal lacerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The revised system provided a subclassification for third-degree lacerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>First-degree lacerations</strong> involve injury to the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the perineum and vaginal epithelium only. The perineal muscles remain intact.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Second-degree lacerations</strong> extend into the fascia and musculature of the perineal body, which includes the deep and superficial transverse perineal muscles and fibers of the pubococcygeus and bulbocavernosus muscles. The anal sphincter muscles remain intact.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Third-degree lacerations</strong> extend through the fascia and musculature of the perineal body and involve some or all of the fibers of the EAS <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the IAS. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Third-degree lacerations are subclassified as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>3a: &lt;50 percent of EAS thickness is torn</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>3b: &gt;50 percent of EAS thickness is torn</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>3c: IAS is torn (in addition to complete rupture of the EAS)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fourth-degree lacerations</strong> involve the perineal structures, EAS, IAS, and the rectal mucosa.</p><p/><p>The above classification system represents a significant improvement over older systems, as it takes the IAS into account. The new classification has been adopted by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as well as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. It has also been acknowledged by the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key initial task is to assess both the extent of bleeding and injury to the perineum, vagina, and anorectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This assessment should include both visual inspection and palpation. Adequate exposure, lighting, and analgesia are essential for a thorough examination. Some studies have suggested that a significant number of sphincter injuries go undetected at the time of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>A thorough visual inspection of the distal vagina, perineum and anorectum should be performed following a vaginal delivery to identify and evaluate the extent of a vaginal tear. The apex of the vaginal laceration should always be identified. The clinician can place four fingers into the perineal laceration, and then spread the fingers to increase visualization of the laceration apex. After inspecting the vagina, a rectal examination is performed to exclude injury to the anorectal mucosa and anal sphincter. Palpation is important to determine whether the rectal mucosa and anal sphincter are intact. The rectovaginal examination is accomplished by placing an index finger in the rectum and the thumb over the anal sphincter and using a pill-rolling motion to assess the sphincter. Of note, the anal sphincter may be disrupted by shearing forces produced by descent of the fetal head, and this can occur in women with an otherwise intact perineum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The surgeon should also make sure that the uterus is properly contracted following the delivery of the placenta. Although delivery of the placenta is not mandatory before beginning the repair, sutures can be disrupted by manual removal of the placenta and other intrauterine manipulations if such interventions become necessary after the perineum has been reapproximated. In general, we suggest placental delivery before repair of the laceration unless the tear needs immediate attention because of profuse bleeding.</p><p>Lacerations can usually be repaired in the delivery room with the patient in the lithotomy position; however, third- and fourth-degree lacerations may require an operating room for ready access to appropriate equipment and lighting, anesthesia support, and maintenance of aseptic conditions. </p><p>If feces are obviously present, it should be removed and the tissues irrigated thoroughly. We perform a gentle scrub with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> under such conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Perineal shaving is unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1697096\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics are unnecessary for repair of first- and second-degree lacerations. For repair of a third- or fourth-degree obstetrical lacerations, we suggest a single dose of a broad spectrum antibiotic (second generation cephalosporin [eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotetan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotetan</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a>; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> if beta lactam allergy] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369 \">table 1</a>)), based upon results of a single randomized trial that prophylaxis resulted in a marked reduction in wound complications (eg, dehiscence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Although this trial had a high rate of loss to follow-up, it is the best available data on which to base a recommendation and antibiotic prophylaxis is a <span class=\"nowrap\">low-cost/low-risk</span> intervention that could prevent complications with significant morbidity. If the wound is contaminated by gross fecal spillage, then local cleansing and irrigation should also be performed. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to reduce the incidence of postoperative infection for third- and fourth-degree lacerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1697103\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The level of anesthesia should be adequate for the surgical repair. If the patient had an epidural catheter placed for labor and delivery <span class=\"nowrap\">analgesia/anesthesia,</span> it can be used to provide anesthesia for the repair. </p><p>For repair of third- or fourth-degree lacerations, re-dosing may be needed prior to beginning the surgical repair as additional muscle relaxation is often necessary to relax the contracted anal sphincter, retrieve the retracted ends, and bring them back together without tension. A bilateral pudendal block with or without a local field block, a saddle block, or general anesthesia are alternatives if there is no preexisting analgesia. </p><p>For repair of first- and second-degree lacerations, pudendal nerve block or local field block is generally adequate if there is no preexisting anesthesia. In patients with adequate epidural anesthesia, local anesthesia has been used to reduce postpartum analgesia requirements, but a randomized trial found neither <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a> nor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> was more effective than saline in the first 24 hours after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pudendal-and-paracervical-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pudendal and paracervical block&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF SUTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of sutures for repair of perineal lacerations is largely one of personal preference. In most institutions, chromic catgut has been largely replaced by synthetic, delayed-absorbable materials, such as polyglactin 910 and polyglycolic acid, as use of chromic catgut appears to be associated with more postpartum discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. A 2010 systematic review of randomized trials concluded that, compared with catgut (plain, chromic, glycerol impregnated), standard absorbable synthetic suture for perineal repair following childbirth was associated with less pain in the first three days postpartum (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.90), less need for analgesia in the first 10 days postpartum (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.87), and less resuturing for dehiscence (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.74), but no difference in long-term pain or dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, the need for removal of unabsorbed synthetic suture material was almost twice as common; this problem is significantly diminished by using rapidly-absorbable synthetic sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. When catgut and glycerol-impregnated catgut were compared, results were similar for most outcomes, although the latter was associated with more short-term pain.</p><p>Rapid absorption (average 42 days) or standard absorption (average 63 days) braided polyglactin 910 sutures and monofilament sutures (eg, poliglecaprone 25, glycomer 631) in a variety of sizes are usually readily available on most Labor and Delivery Units. In general, one should use the smallest diameter suture that has adequate tensile and knot strength for the task; <span class=\"nowrap\">2/0</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">3/0</span> sutures are suitable for soft tissue repair. Monofilament sutures may cause less tissue reaction than braided sutures, and thus may minimize discomfort and infection risk. However, this must be balanced against the significantly longer absorption time, and quicker loss of tensile strength that is characteristic of monofilament sutures. In general, the use of polyglactin 910 suture sizes <span class=\"nowrap\">2/0</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">3/0</span> is a reasonable choice for most routine repair of perineal and vaginal lacerations. Rapid absorption polyglactin 910 appears to be associated with reduced perineal pain, including a reduction in superficial dyspareunia, at three months postpartum, as well as a significant reduction in the need for suture removal up to three months postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sutures described in the text represent the author's preferences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Third- and fourth-degree tears</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Third- or fourth-degree tears, if present, should be repaired first. To help with exposure, a vaginal pack can be used to prevent uterine bleeding from obscuring the surgical field and a self-retaining retractor, such as a Gelpie or Weitlander, is helpful if an assistant is not readily available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic management of pain during labor and delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The aim of reconstructive surgery is to restore the continuity of both the external and internal anal sphincters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, a thick perineal body and rectovaginal septum should be created to provide muscular and structural support in the thin area between the anterior anorectum and vagina. Proper reconstruction will also result in lengthening of the anal canal and restoration of a functional high pressure zone within it.</p><p>The goal of sphincter repair (either primary or secondary) is reconstruction of a muscular cylinder that is at least 2 cm thick and 3 cm long [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/4,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20</a>]. This results in an anatomically and functionally correct anal canal. Simple plication of the severed ends of the external anal sphincter with two or three interrupted, absorbable sutures is commonly performed, but may be inadequate since this approach is frequently associated with persistent sphincter defects and symptomatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Meticulous hemostasis and anatomic reapproximation of all disrupted tissue layers are the key principles for preventing complications and restoring fecal competence.</p><p>The optimal repair consists of a multilayer closure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66412\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66412 \">figure 4</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a fourth-degree laceration is present, we repair the torn anal mucosa using a continuous (nonlocking) <span class=\"nowrap\">3/0</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">4/0</span> braided polyglactin on a tapered needle; a monofilament suture such as poliglecaprone 25 is also acceptable. Interrupted sutures can be used, but result in a larger quantity of foreign body because of multiple knots.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The internal anal sphincter should be properly identified and repaired as a separate layer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/4,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,22</a>]. It often retracts laterally and superiorly and appears as thickened, pale pink, shiny tissue just above the anal mucosa that some clinicians refer to as perirectal fascia. Reapproximation of this layer is important for the strength and integrity of the repair and for achieving anal continence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. We use a continuous <span class=\"nowrap\">3/0</span> polyglactin suture or <span class=\"nowrap\">3/0</span> monofilament synthetic suture (eg, poliglecaprone 25) on a tapered needle for this repair.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The external sphincter is then identified and repaired. The repair begins by identifying and grasping the two severed ends of the dark red external anal sphincter muscle with Allis clamps. It may be necessary to push the Allis clamp deep into the surrounding connective tissue to locate the sphincter since one or both ends typically retract when it ruptures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The repair consists of either an end-to-end or overlapping plication of the disrupted external anal sphincter and its capsule using interrupted or figure-of-eight sutures; <span class=\"nowrap\">2/0</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">3/0</span> polydioxanone or <span class=\"nowrap\">2/0</span> polyglactin suture on a cut tapered 1 or 2 needle are reasonable suture choices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81849\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81849 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62165\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62165 \">figure 6</a>). We recommend not using chromic suture for repair of the anal sphincter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We typically place at least four or five interrupted sutures, but we are not opposed to placing more if it is possible. It may be necessary to sharply mobilize either sphincter end to achieve a better anastomosis and minimize tension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a 2013 meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing the overlap and end-to-end techniques, the overlap technique was associated with a non-statistical lower risk of one or more anal incontinence symptoms (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68-1.17; 5 trials, n = 2221), but this was primarily in the first 12 months after delivery and disappeared at 24 and 36 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There were no significant differences between procedures in perineal pain, dyspareunia, or quality of life at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after repair. Limitations of these trials were the inclusion of multiparous women and women with partial tears, and differences in measurement of outcomes and surgical experience.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subsequent to this meta-analysis, a randomized trial of the overlap and end-to-end techniques limited to primiparous women with complete tears reported that at 6 and 12 months postpartum the overlap technique was associated with a higher rate of flatal incontinence (6 months: 61 versus 39 percent, p = &#160;005; 12 months: 56 versus 31 percent, p = 0.12) and a trend toward a higher rate of fecal incontinence (6 months: 15 versus 8 percent, p&gt;.2; 12 months 16 versus 6 percent, p = &#160;17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Another randomized trial of the two techniques in primiparous and multiparous women with either partial or complete tears found the overlap repair was not superior to the end-to-end technique with respect to fecal incontinence at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Others have observed that the incidence of residual anal sphincter damage on endoanal ultrasonography is similar for the two techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/3,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the absence of clear evidence favoring one technique over the other, the choice of overlap or end-to-end repair should be based on the surgeon&rsquo;s preference and experience.</p><p/><p>After the sphincter repair is completed, the next task is to rebuild the distal rectovaginal septum and perineal body. This layer helps to maintain the proper spatial distance between the anus and vagina, and may prevent suture erosion from the deeper layers. Another goal of this layer is to help take the tension off of the underlying sphincter repair. We typically use an interrupted <span class=\"nowrap\">2/0</span> polyglactin suture on a cutting needle. </p><p>The end result of the surgical repair should be reconstruction of an adequate perineal body, a thickened rectovaginal septum, and an intact cylindrical sphincter complex that is approximately 2 cm wide and 3 cm long. The anus should easily admit one finger following the procedure, although skeletal muscle paralysis induced by anesthesia may temporarily weaken the tone of the anal canal.</p><p>The remainder of the repair is as described below for first- and second-degree tears (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75126\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75126 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">First- and second-degree tears</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If there is no third- or fourth-degree extension, vaginal lacerations with extensions into the perineal body have traditionally been repaired in layers using a series of continuous suture techniques. The repair begins at the apex of the vaginal laceration and ends with a subcuticular closure that terminates just above the level of the posterior fourchette.</p><p>Continuous non-locking suture techniques for repair of the vagina, perineal muscles, and skin appear to be preferable to traditional interrupted methods. The continuous technique is faster and uses the smallest amount of suture material; the only advantage of an intermittent technique is that if one suture breaks, there are others to hold the repair in place; however, this is probably not critical in the perineum. A continuous subcuticular closure of the perineal skin is preferred to interrupted transcutaneous stitches, as a meta-analysis of randomized trials of continuous versus interrupted suture techniques for perineal closure found that the continuous suturing technique was associated with [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less pain for up to 10 days postpartum (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.88; nine trials), especially when used for all layers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less need for analgesia for up to 10 days postpartum (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.84).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less need for suture removal (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.98), but no significant differences in the need for resuturing of wounds or long-term pain. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trend in reduction of dyspareunia up to three months postpartum (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67-1.09).</p><p/><p>The differences in pain between the two techniques may be due to increased suture tension with interrupted stitches, which may lead to edema and pain. With continuous sutures, the tension is transferred along the length of a single suture and the subcuticular layer is placed well below the skin surface, thus avoiding the nerve endings.</p><p>The vaginal epithelium is reapproximated first, and should include any underlying divided tissue in order to build up the rectovaginal septum. Care should be taken to identify and incorporate the apex of the episiotomy in the repair. If the apex of the episiotomy extends out of the field of vision, a suture can be placed below the apex and the suture tail used as a purchase to pull the apex into view. An absorbable suture (typically a <span class=\"nowrap\">2/0</span> polyglactin 910) is usually used for the repair. The anatomical landmarks, such as the vermilion border and hymenal ring, should be identified and reapproximated. Theoretically, use of a locking stitch will prevent pulling the suture too tight and shortening the vagina; we do not use a locking stitch, as there is no evidence to support this theory. We prefer to close with a loose, continuous non-locking technique to reduce the risk of narrowing the vagina, and make sure that the sutures are not placed too wide of the edge.</p><p>Following closure of the vaginal portion of the laceration down to the level of the hymenal ring, the perineal body and bulbocavernosus muscle are then reapproximated. The same suture is usually passed through the vaginal layer above through to the deep perineal layer, in what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;transition stitch.&rdquo; The suture is then placed through the superficial bulbocavernosus muscle on each side in a &ldquo;V&rdquo; configuration, commonly referred to as the &quot;crown&quot; stitch. Some surgeons prefer to close this layer with three to four interrupted sutures to approximate the deep and superficial perineal muscles. The critical point is to realign the muscles so that the skin edges can be reapproximated with minimal tension.</p><p>The suture is next passed through the deep perineal tissue from side to side in a vertical direction until the edge of the perineal tear is reached. At this point, the suture is brought back up in the reverse direction along the perineal body in a subcuticular manner and tied at, or just inside, the introitus with a loop knot.</p><p>Some authors have proposed leaving the perineal skin open, to heal by secondary intention, because avoiding suture material has been associated with better skin sensation when assessed one year postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Two randomized trials attempted to evaluate whether suturing or non-suturing of first- and second-degree perineal lacerations improved outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. There was a similar degree of postpartum discomfort with both approaches, but one study described better wound healing when subcuticular closure was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A meta-analysis of the two trials concluded there was insufficient evidence to recommend surgical repair over nonsurgical management, and more data were needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6881188\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The comparative outcomes of women who undergo episiotomy and repair versus those who do not undergo episiotomy are reviewed separately.

A prospective cohort study of over 250 women with third- and fourth-degree lacerations reported a nearly 25 percent incidence of wound breakdown and 20 percent incidence of wound infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

It is not known if the infection and breakdown risks vary among the end-to-end and overlap techniques, although the choice of sphincter repair seems unlikely to impact infection risk. </p><p>Third- and fourth-degree lacerations are associated with symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction such as incontinence and prolapse.

The purpose for delay was to allow sufficient time for revascularization of the wound edges and formation of scar tissue, which was thought to be of value during reanastomosis of the torn sphincter. However, few data support this approach and it commits the woman to an extended period of physical, social, and sexual disability because of continuous incontinence. Available evidence, although extremely limited and inconclusive, supports re-repair of both superficial and deep episiotomy dehiscence within the first two weeks following childbirth, which may result in a reduction in perineal pain during the healing process up to six months postdelivery and a reduction in dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Early repair of episiotomy breakdown has replaced the traditional approach and has overall success rates of 87 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth/abstract/38-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-43</a>].

In some cases, transfer to an operating room and regional or local anesthesia may be necessary to remove nonviable tissue (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;</a>).
