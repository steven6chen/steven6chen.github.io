Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump or fill with blood well. As a result, the heart lags behind in its job of moving blood throughout the body. This can lead to symptoms such as swelling, trouble breathing, and feeling tired.</p><p>There are 2 main types of heart failure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <strong>heart failure with reduced ejection fraction</strong>, the heart is too weak. When the heart pumps, it doesn't squeeze normally. This type of heart failure is also known as &quot;systolic heart failure.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <strong>heart failure with preserved ejection fraction</strong>, the heart is too stiff. When the heart pumps, it doesn't relax and fill with blood normally. This type of heart failure is also known as &quot;diastolic heart failure.&quot;</p><p/><p>The &quot;ejection fraction&quot; (or &quot;EF&quot;) is the amount of blood that the heart pumps out with each heartbeat. People with &quot;heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot; have an EF that is <strong>lower</strong> than normal. People with the other type of heart failure, &quot;heart failure with preserved ejection fraction,&quot; have a <strong>normal</strong> (or almost normal) EF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284585526\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing &ndash; At first, people might have trouble breathing only with activity. Over time, they can also have trouble breathing when resting or lying down.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, or belly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284585541\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for heart failure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse thinks you might have any type of heart failure, he or she will ask about your symptoms, do an exam, and order some of the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest X-ray &ndash; This test can show if there is fluid in the lungs. It also shows the general shape of the heart and large blood vessels in the chest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiogram (also called &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BNP or NT-proBNP &ndash; Brain natriuretic peptide (also called BNP) and N-terminal pro-BNP (also called NT-proBNP) are blood tests that help show if heart failure is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart as it beats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress test &ndash; During this test, a doctor records your ECG while you exercise on a treadmill or bike, or get medicine to make your heart pump faster.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac catheterization (also called &quot;cardiac cath&quot;) &ndash; During this test, the doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in your leg or arm. Then he or she moves the tube up to your heart. When the tube is in your heart or blood vessels, he or she will take measurements. The doctor might also put a dye that shows up on an X-ray into the tube. This can show if any arteries in your heart are narrowed or blocked. This part of the test is called &quot;coronary angiography.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284585556\"><span class=\"h1\">How is heart failure with reduced ejection fraction treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment usually includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines &ndash; Medicines can help reduce symptoms and help you live longer. They might also lower the chance that you will need to go to the hospital. Many people need to take 3 or more medicines every day. It's important to take your medicines every day, even if you feel well. Tell your doctor or nurse if you can't afford your medicines or if they cause side effects. There are often ways to help with these issues. The right medicines for you will depend on your symptoms and other medical conditions, and can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) &ndash; An ACE inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI widens blood vessels and lowers blood pressure, making it easier for your heart to pump. These medicines might also protect the heart from hormone effects that can happen when a person has heart failure. If you can't take an ACE inhibitor, your doctor might prescribe an ARB or other medicine. The ARNI <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sacubitril-and-valsartan-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sacubitril-valsartan</a> is a newer heart failure medicine that can be used instead of an ACE inhibitor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A beta-blocker &ndash; This medicine can slow the heart rate down and sometimes lowers blood pressure. It can reduce the amount of work the heart has to do. When you start taking a beta-blocker, you might feel a little worse. But after your body gets used to the medicine, you might start to feel better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivabradine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Ivabradine</a> (brand name: Corlanor) is a newer type of drug to slow the heart down. Your doctor might prescribe ivabradine if your heart rate is still a little fast with a beta blocker, or if you cannot take a beta blocker.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A diuretic (water pill) &ndash; This medicine helps the body get rid of extra salt and fluid. It can reduce the fluid in your lungs or swelling in your legs or belly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist &ndash; This helps the body get rid of extra salt and fluid. But it also helps the body hold onto a mineral called potassium. That's important, because the body needs potassium to work normally. Other diuretics sometimes make the body lose potassium. An aldosterone receptor antagonist might also block harmful effects of aldosterone on the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nitrate with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydralazine</a> &ndash; A nitrate and hydralazine work together to relax and expand blood vessels. This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood throughout the body. These two medicines come in a single pill, but it is possible to get the two ingredients separately for much less money. The two ingredients come in pills of &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosorbide-dinitrate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">isosorbide dinitrate</a>&quot; and &quot;hydralazine.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Digoxin</a> &ndash; Digoxin helps the heart pump with more force. This can help reduce some of the symptoms of heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treating your coronary heart disease (if you have it) &ndash; In coronary heart disease, the arteries that bring blood to the heart get clogged. Treatment can include medicines, a procedure to unblock a clogged artery, or surgery.</p><p/><p>Other treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction sometimes includes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A device to help the heart pump with more force or beat at the right rhythm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pump attached to the heart to increase blood flow to the body and reduce the work the heart needs to do</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart transplant surgery &ndash; This is surgery to replace your diseased heart with a healthy heart. It is done only when all other treatments do not work.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284585604\"><span class=\"h1\">What else can I do on my own to protect my heart?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help feel better and reduce the chances that you will need to go to the hospital, you can do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if you are dizzy or weak, or if you lose or gain weight suddenly. Weigh yourself every morning after you urinate but before breakfast. Try to wear about the same amount of clothing every time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow the action plan your doctor gives you. An action plan is a list of instructions that tells you what to do if your symptoms change. To use an action plan, watch your symptoms closely and weigh yourself every day. If you do not feel well or if you lose or gain weight suddenly, look at your action plan to see what to do (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72459 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75501 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if you have chest pain or other signs of a heart attack (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52579 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight, if you are overweight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit the amount of alcohol you drink. If you are a woman, do not have more than 1 drink a day. If you are a man, do not have more than 2 drinks in a day.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284585619\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=swelling-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Swelling (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cardiac catheterization (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart transplant (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=edema-swelling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Edema (swelling) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart transplantation (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
