They present as swelling in the popliteal fossa due to enlargement of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa, which lies between these two muscles on the medial side of the fossa slightly distal to the center crease in the back of the knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Popliteal cysts in adults are often secondary to degenerative or inflammatory joint disease or joint injury; they usually communicate with the adjacent knee joint space, especially in older patients with knee pathology. Communicating cysts contain synovial fluid. In children, popliteal cysts are usually a primary process, arising directly from the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa; they do not communicate with the joint space. (See <a href=\"#H171882322\" class=\"local\">'Popliteal (Baker's) cyst in children'</a> below.)</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of popliteal (Baker's) cyst will be presented here. The clinical and radiographic evaluation of knee pain is reviewed separately.

They tend to occur in adults from ages 35 to 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In general, the prevalence of popliteal cysts varies based upon the imaging technique used, the age of the patient population, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> whether the cyst is secondary or primary.</p><p>The prevalence ranges from 5 to 40 percent using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among adults with suspected internal derangement or osteoarthritis (OA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]; in a similar adult population, it ranged from 23 to 32 percent by arthrography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The prevalence increases with age, possibly because <span class=\"nowrap\">knee/bursal</span> communications increase in prevalence with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There is no consistent difference in frequency between the sexes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22471952\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of most popliteal cysts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint-cyst communication, which has been documented by cadaveric dissections, at the time of arthroscopy, and by injecting dye directly into these structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A valve-like effect between the knee joint space and the cyst, which is controlled by gastrocnemius-semimembranosus muscle changes with knee flexion and extension. This contributes to sequestration of synovial fluid in the popliteal fossa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The communicating space is open in flexion, but the tense gastrocnemius-semimembranosus muscles close this pathway in extension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative intraarticular knee pressure during partial knee flexion (minus 6 mmHg), compared with a positive pressure (16 mmHg) during extension. These pressure changes help direct the synovial fluid flow from the suprapatellar bursa toward the knee during flexion and toward the cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Bursal pressure exceeds joint pressure during extension, but the flow of synovial fluid is blocked by the valve-like effect just described.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlargement of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa from repeated small traumas of the bursa related to muscle contraction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint capsule herniation into the popliteal fossa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630401051\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for the development of popliteal cysts in adults include a history of trauma, noted in about one-third of patients, or a history of coexistent joint disease, seen in about two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The most common knee disorders include osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and meniscal tears. The presence of popliteal cysts among patients with OA was unrelated to the radiographic severity of the arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Popliteal cysts may also be seen in other joint disorders, such as infectious arthritis or pigmented villonodular synovitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30937684\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of a popliteal cyst are influenced by the size of the cyst, associated joint pathology, and the presence or absence of complications, such as cyst dissection or rupture. Most cysts are small, asymptomatic, not clearly evident on physical examination, and detected only by imaging studies performed because of unrelated joint symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>When symptomatic, common signs and symptoms include posterior knee pain, knee stiffness, and swelling or a mass behind the knee (especially with the knee in extension). Patients frequently report discomfort with prolonged standing and with hyperflexion of the knee. Symptoms and swelling may be worsened by activity.</p><p>Symptoms due primarily to an associated joint disease may also occur, such as instability due to internal derangement or joint pain from inflammatory arthritis or osteoarthritis (OA). In some patients, these are the major or only symptoms present. The presentation and clinical findings of the popliteal cyst do not differ based upon the underlying pathology or associated disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10003474\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Popliteal cysts may enlarge, dissect, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rupture, resulting in compression of adjacent structures and a constellation of symptoms and signs that may resemble venous thrombosis (thrombophlebitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Significant complications of popliteal cysts include pseudothrombophlebitis, leg ischemia, nerve entrapment, and compartment syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. These events are uncommon, but there is a lack of data to accurately estimate their frequency. Though the acute pain generally subsides in a matter of days, the swelling may persist indefinitely, resulting in persistent limitation of knee flexion due to the size of the cyst.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23338109\"><span class=\"h3\">Enlargement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A tender cyst enlarging into the calf (a dissecting cyst) can result in erythema, distal edema, and a positive Homans' sign, similar to findings in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Enlargement of the cyst within the popliteal space (independent of dissection or rupture) can compress an adjacent vein, causing lower leg and ankle swelling due to venous obstruction. Historically, the cyst may be noted before the edema, suggesting that the swelling may be related to the cyst rather than thrombosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23338116\"><span class=\"h3\">Rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With cyst rupture, severe pain simulates thrombosis or muscle rupture, with warmth, tenderness, and erythema of the calf. A ruptured cyst can also produce ecchymoses, which may involve the posterior calf from the popliteal fossa down to the ankle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. An ecchymotic area below the medial malleolus, termed the &quot;crescent sign,&quot; may be present. In some cases, the rupture can extend upward into the thigh or down the anterior lateral aspect of the leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cyst rupture may also be more indolent, with calf and ankle swelling developing without much pain. Ruptured popliteal cysts can occur without known joint disease or any prior history of joint pain or swelling, sometimes after strenuous exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104791191\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rare complications that may be seen with cyst dissection or rupture include posterior tibial nerve entrapment (resulting in calf pain and plantar numbness posteriorly), anterior compartment syndrome (causing foot drop and anterolateral lower leg swelling), posterior compartment syndrome (resulting in calf swelling with pain aggravated by passive toe extension with plantar dysesthesia with toe weakness), and popliteal artery occlusion (causing leg ischemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/12,15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2355181\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a popliteal mass, the diagnosis of a popliteal (Baker's) cyst can usually be based upon physical examination alone. Imaging studies are performed in some patients, particularly when there is diagnostic uncertainty and when another condition is suspected. However, imaging is usually not required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2355188\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We diagnose a Baker's cyst by the finding of a medial popliteal mass that is most prominent with the patient standing and the knee fully extended. The swelling softens or disappears upon knee flexion to 45 degrees (defined as Foucher's sign), as the tension on the cyst is relieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The knee should also be examined with the patient lying supine and the knee put through an arc of motion ranging from full extension to at least 90 degrees of flexion to confirm these findings and to adequately examine the knee joint for associated pathology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2355195\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging, usually plain radiography and ultrasonography, should be performed if the diagnosis is uncertain on examination or if another condition is suspected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91803\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91803 \">image 1</a>). Such clinical settings may include difficulty differentiating a cystic from a solid mass on physical examination, lack of significant change with range of motion, a laterally located mass, and the absence of knee pathology. Plain radiographs may detect other associated abnormalities that can be associated with knee pain, such as osteonecrosis or significant cartilage narrowing due to osteoarthritis. Imaging is also needed if the clinical presentation suggests vascular or neurologic compromise or possible thrombophlebitis.</p><p>We take the following approach to imaging:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the use of ultrasound and plain radiography of the knee as the initial imaging modalities. They are both noninvasive and easily obtained, and they provide complementary information.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ultrasound can readily identify cysts, usually as fluid-filled spaces, and shows the size and extent of the cyst in relation to adjacent soft tissue structures. Additional advantages of ultrasound include the absence of ionizing radiation and its increasing availability in the office setting. Cysts that are as small as 1 to 2 centimeters can be reliably visualized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91804\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91804 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Ultrasound can also distinguish popliteal (Baker's) cysts from popliteal aneurysms, ganglion cysts, or other popliteal masses. The cyst appears on ultrasound as an anechoic mass, which may include echogenic debris or septations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91805\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91805 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although a plain radiograph of the knee is of limited benefit for viewing the cyst itself, it can demonstrate joint or bone abnormalities that may be associated with the cyst. A soft tissue mass (the cyst) or a joint effusion may be seen, particularly on lateral views [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with possible thrombophlebitis or cyst-related &quot;pseudothrombophlebitis&quot; syndrome, we use ultrasound because it can image the enlarged, dissected, or ruptured cyst (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91806\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91806 \">image 4</a>), as well as the venous circulation, and the findings on ultrasound correlate well with venography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It may not be possible to distinguish cyst rupture from dissection, but either can usually be detected if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Infrequently, a complete cyst rupture may not be visualized ultrasonographically, and additional studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be required (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91807\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91807 \">image 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest MRI of the knee if an internal derangement is suspected and surgery is being considered, or when the diagnosis is uncertain after ultrasonography. For example, we perform MRI with contrast to differentiate a tumor from a popliteal cyst with debris if a solid component is detected in a popliteal mass on ultrasound or if greater definition of the mass is required. MRI provides high-quality images of the popliteal space, the cyst, and associated structures. It can also define intraarticular knee pathology, such as a meniscal or ligamentous injury, which ultrasound cannot, and it does not expose patients to ionizing radiation. On MRI, the cyst shows high signal on T2-weighted, short T1 inversion recovery (STIR), and proton density sequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91808\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91808 \">image 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22472104\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">MRI provides better soft tissue contrast and multi-planar imaging capability than other imaging methods; thus, it is the technique of choice in patients who require further study following ultrasound and plain radiography to confirm the cystic nature of the lesion, evaluate the anatomical relationship to the joint and surrounding tissues, and identify associated intraarticular disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other imaging techniques that are rarely used to detect or characterize a popliteal cyst include arthrography and computerized tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/2,21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21,24</a>]. We prefer the imaging techniques previously described.</p><p/><p>Cysts that occur only as the result of arthrographically-induced distention of the joint and a normal communicating bursa are not considered true popliteal cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22472104\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal disorders that mimic many of the clinical features of a Baker's cyst include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystic masses, including synovial cysts and ganglion cysts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solid masses, including sarcomas and lymphoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Popliteal artery aneurysms</p><p/><p>It is especially important to distinguish between the infrequently occurring symptoms of pseudothrombophlebitis caused by a popliteal cyst and symptoms resulting from a true deep vein thrombosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14615843\"><span class=\"h2\">Deep vein thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deep vein thrombosis may be difficult to distinguish on clinical grounds alone from &quot;pseudothrombophlebitis&quot; resulting from a markedly enlarged, dissected, or ruptured Baker's cyst. Either may cause swelling, warmth, tenderness, and a positive Homan's sign. An enlarged or ruptured cyst may also cause venous compression and an increased risk of a DVT occurring together with the cyst. (See <a href=\"#H10003474\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p>Clinical findings favoring the diagnosis of pseudothrombophlebitis rather than DVT include the presence of knee pain and swelling, inflammatory joint disease or other knee pathology, a knee effusion, and the absence of a cord or deep venous tenderness on examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. The distinction between pseudothrombophlebitis and a DVT can usually be made with ultrasound studies to identify a cyst, if present, and to evaluate for possible venous disease. The diagnostic considerations should be reviewed with the radiologist prior to the study, as the specific techniques for the diagnosis of DVT differ from those used for the evaluation of a popliteal cyst alone. (See <a href=\"#H2355195\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2576295\"><span class=\"h2\">Other cystic masses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other cystic masses may occur around the knee and extend posteriorly, mimicking a Baker's cyst, including ganglia, meniscal cysts, pes anserine bursitis, bursitis of the tibial collateral ligament, and cruciate ligament cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/popliteal-bakers-cyst/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These cysts can be distinguished on ultrasound imaging from popliteal Baker's cysts by their failure to extend between the gastrocnemius and semitendinosus tendons. In patients in whom a solid component is detected in a popliteal mass on ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast can help differentiate a tumor from a popliteal cyst with debris. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganglion-cysts-of-the-wrist-and-hand#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ganglion cysts of the wrist and hand&quot;, section on 'Description'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-evaluation-of-the-chronically-painful-knee-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic evaluation of the chronically painful knee in adults&quot;, section on 'Bursitis and cysts'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23945277\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Discrete masses in the popliteal fossa, such as lipomas, liposarcomas, or other solid tumors, are uncommon but can often be distinguished from popliteal cysts using ultrasound or other imaging techniques.

A positive Foucher's sign of softening <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> of decreased size of a popliteal cyst with knee flexion is consistent with, but not specific for, a Baker's cyst.

The cyst forms as an enlargement of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa, which lies between these two muscles on the medial side of the fossa slightly distal to the center crease of the back of the knee.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In adults, the cysts are usually in communication with the adjacent knee joint space. The development and maintenance of the cyst is influenced by communication between the posterior joint capsule and the bursa, a pressure gradient favoring movement of synovial fluid towards the cyst, and a valve-like effect between the knee joint space and the cyst. This effect is controlled by gastrocnemius-semimembranosus muscle changes with knee flexion and extension by which fluid is sequestered in the popliteal fossa. (See <a href=\"#H22471952\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H630401051\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary cysts, the usual form in children, arise directly from the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa but do not communicate with the joint space. (See <a href=\"#H30937669\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30937676\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior knee pain, knee stiffness, and detection of swelling or a mass behind the knee are the most commonly noted symptoms, although most cysts are small, asymptomatic, and only noted incidentally. The cysts are typically more prominent when the knee is in extension. Symptoms from associated joint disease may be the major or only symptoms present. (See <a href=\"#H30937684\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most symptomatic cysts do not cause significant complications. However, popliteal cysts may enlarge, dissect, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rupture, resulting in compression of adjacent structures and a constellation of symptoms and signs that can resemble venous thrombosis, called pseudothrombophlebitis, including calf pain, erythema, distal edema, and a positive Homans' sign. A ruptured cyst can also produce ecchymoses which may involve the posterior calf from the popliteal fossa down to the ankle. Infrequent complications of popliteal cysts include leg ischemia, nerve entrapment, and compartment syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H10003474\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We usually diagnose popliteal cysts based upon physical examination in patients with popliteal swelling who lack signs or symptoms of cyst rupture or dissection. We examine the knee with the patient lying supine through an arc of motion ranging from full extension to at least 90 degrees of flexion. The mass, which is usually felt medially in the popliteal space and is most prominent at full knee extension, may soften or disappear on flexion to 45 degrees (Foucher's sign) as the tension on the cyst is relieved. (See <a href=\"#H2355181\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2355188\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain on examination alone or in whom the clinical presentation is consistent with pseudothrombophlebitis or vascular or neurologic compromise, we use ultrasound and plain radiography of the knee as the initial imaging modalities. We obtain MRI of the knee when an internal derangement is suspected and surgery is being considered or when the diagnosis is uncertain after ultrasonography. (See <a href=\"#H2355195\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), if signs of calf pain or swelling are present; other cystic masses such as ganglia; solid tumors such as lipomas and liposarcomas; and popliteal artery aneurysms. Most of these entities can be distinguished from popliteal (Baker's) cysts by ultrasound imaging if suspected clinically; we perform MRI if solid elements of a cyst or a mass are detected on ultrasonography. (See <a href=\"#H22472104\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We manage popliteal cysts in adults primarily by treating the underlying intraarticular inflammatory or degenerative process associated with the cyst. In patients with painful symptomatic cysts, despite usual management of their joint disease, or those in whom temporary relief of symptoms would be of benefit prior to a more definite procedure (eg, in patients with a meniscal tear), we suggest treatment with a glucocorticoid injection of the knee joint (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H30937698\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H104791067\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with calf symptoms, we perform imaging, usually ultrasonography, to exclude DVT. We do not treat incidentally noted asymptomatic popliteal cysts, and children with primary cysts generally do not require treatment. We evaluate patients with symptomatic cysts resistant to these interventions for the accuracy of the diagnosis or the presence of persistent articular pathology or a noncommunicating cyst prior to direct cyst injection or referral for surgical excision.
