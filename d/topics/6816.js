Causes include neurologic ailments and a range of non-neurologic conditions. The diagnosis of potentially life-threatening neurologic and neuromuscular processes requires a systematic, anatomic approach based upon a careful history, physical examination, and in some cases, imaging studies.</p><p>Particularly in the elderly, infection, cardiovascular disease, and dehydration must be considered as possible causes of weakness. However, such conditions cause generalized malaise rather than true neuromuscular weakness and will not be discussed here, except to mention them as important considerations in the differential diagnosis.</p><p>The approach to the diagnosis and initial management of patients presenting to the ED with acute, nontraumatic neurologic and neuromuscular weakness will be reviewed here. Medical conditions characterized by general malaise or chronic weakness is discussed separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE WEAKNESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although this topic reviews the approach to the patient with acute weakness from nontraumatic neurologic or neuromuscular disease, a broad differential diagnosis, including causes of generalized weakness (or malaise), is presented here to assist clinicians looking for additional information about these conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening central causes of unilateral weakness</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic stroke &ndash; Sudden loss of focal brain function is the core feature of the onset of ischemic stroke. This may manifest as acute, focal, unilateral weakness or paralysis in the face, upper extremity, or lower extremity, or as difficulty with coordination and gait. Other medical illness can mimic stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69869 \">table 1</a>), and symptoms of stroke can vary widely based upon the cause and the artery involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69907\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69907 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75487\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75487 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracerebral hemorrhage &ndash; The neurologic symptoms and signs associated with intracerebral hemorrhage frequently worsen over minutes to hours, in contrast to ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Headache, vomiting, seizures, and a decreased level of consciousness often occur. Unilateral weakness or paralysis may be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) &ndash; Sudden onset of severe headache is the most common presentation of SAH. This may be accompanied by loss of consciousness, seizure, nausea and vomiting, and meningismus. Lateralizing signs, such as unilateral weakness, are uncommon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening and other serious causes of bilateral weakness</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Brainstem stroke</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brainstem stroke &ndash; Lesions in the brainstem may produce ipsilateral cranial nerve and contralateral body weakness. Clinical findings vary depending upon the areas involved but may include vertigo, depressed mental status, visual field deficits, oculomotor abnormalities, and bulbar findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-circulation-cerebrovascular-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Spinal cord disease</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal cord inflammation or compression &ndash; A spinal cord lesion may be suspected when there are bilateral motor and sensory signs or symptoms that do not involve the head. Motor deficits involve weakness, muscle spasticity, and hyperreflexia (although hyporeflexia is often seen acutely); sensory findings involve a discrete level below which sensation is absent or reduced. Urinary bladder function may be affected resulting in either urinary retention or incontinence depending on the level of spinal cord injury. A wide range of pathologies can cause spinal cord disease, including trauma, infection (eg, epidural abscess), neoplasm, hemorrhage, inflammation (eg, transverse myelitis), and degenerative disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral nerve disease</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) &ndash; The cardinal clinical features of GBS consist of progressive, fairly symmetric muscle weakness, accompanied by absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-weakness-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Patients usually present a few days to a week after onset, with progressive weakness of the legs and arms (sometimes initially only in the legs). Patients frequently present to the ED with a complaint of numbness or paresthesias in the limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-weakness-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Weakness can vary from mild difficulty with walking to nearly complete paralysis of all extremity, facial, respiratory, and bulbar muscles. Early diagnosis enables clinicians to initiate therapy as soon as possible to prevent further nerve damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-weakness-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Fever is characteristically absent. Despite patients' reports of paresthesias, the sensory exam is typically normal. Most patients eventually develop an unsteady gait that progresses to an ascending complete paralysis. Deep tendon reflexes are characteristically absent. Respiratory paralysis and death can occur in severe cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tick-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tick paralysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuromuscular junction disease</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myasthenia gravis (MG) &ndash; MG can produce weakness in any muscle group. Certain presentations are more common: ocular symptoms (eg, ptosis, diplopia) occur in 50 percent; bulbar symptoms (eg, dysarthria, dysphagia, fatigable chewing) occur in about 15 percent; and isolated limb weakness occurs in about 5 percent. Myasthenic crisis occurs when respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bulbar muscle weakness produces acute respiratory distress. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myasthenic-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myasthenic crisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning &ndash; Acute toxicity from organophosphorus agents presents with manifestations of cholinergic excess. The dominant clinical features include bradycardia, miosis, lacrimation, salivation, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, urination, emesis, diarrhea, diaphoresis, and generalized weakness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organophosphate-and-carbamate-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Botulism &ndash; Patients with food-borne botulism may have a prodrome of vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dry mouth. Symptoms of cranial nerve involvement then develop (eg, fixed pupillary dilation, diplopia, nystagmus, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria), followed by descending muscle weakness, which usually progresses from the trunk and upper extremities to the lower extremities. Smooth muscle paralysis leads to urinary retention; diaphragmatic paralysis can lead to respiratory distress requiring intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscle disease</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcoholic myopathy &ndash; This myopathy occurs in long-standing alcoholics, presents with muscle cramps, tenderness, and swelling, and is a major cause of nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-myopathies#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced myopathies&quot;, section on 'Alcohol'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myositis &ndash; Both dermatomyositis and polymyositis usually present with symmetric proximal muscle weakness, which has often been worsening over several months. Muscle pain and tenderness is present in up to half of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening medical causes with focal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic conditions most often cause generalized weakness without focal findings. However, exceptions exist, most notably hypoglycemia and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoglycemia &ndash; Symptoms and signs of severe hypoglycemia are nonspecific and can include fatigue, dizziness, visual disturbances, drowsiness, dysarthria, and depressed mental status. Untreated, symptoms can progress to seizures or coma.

Hypo- or hyperkalemia, hypo- or hypercalcemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypophosphatemia may be the cause, and are discussed separately:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Potassium disorders (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myopathies-of-systemic-disease#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myopathies of systemic disease&quot;, section on 'Hypokalemic myopathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemic periodic paralysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Calcium disorders (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypercalcemia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia&quot;, section on 'Musculoskeletal symptoms'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Magnesium and phosphate disorders (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-magnesium-depletion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of magnesium depletion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Signs and symptoms of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Muscle weakness usually does not occur at potassium concentrations above 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> if hypokalemia develops slowly, but significant weakness may occur with sudden decreases. Weakness usually begins with the lower extremities, progresses to the trunk and upper extremities, and can worsen to the point of paralysis. Patients with renal dysfunction can develop hyperkalemia that manifests initially as weakness and may deteriorate into a life-threatening arrhythmia if untreated.</p><p>Endocrine abnormalities, such as thyrotoxicosis, may also cause periodic paralysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening causes of generalized weakness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A brief list of several important causes of generalized weakness is provided here to assist with the differential diagnosis and to allow ready access to additional information.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis &ndash; Among other symptoms, malaise and generalized weakness may be a manifestation of sepsis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) &ndash; A significant percentage of elderly patients with ACS complain only of generalized weakness. Diabetics and women may also complain of weakness rather than chest discomfort when experiencing an ACS.

Moderately or mildly CO-intoxicated patients often present with constitutional symptoms, including headache (the most common presenting symptom), malaise, nausea, and dizziness, and may be misdiagnosed with acute viral syndromes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-monoxide-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon monoxide poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adrenal insufficiency &ndash; Patients with chronic, progressive adrenal insufficiency most often develop the following symptoms: chronic malaise, lassitude, fatigue that is worsened by exertion and improved with bed rest, weakness that is generalized (ie, not limited to particular muscle groups), anorexia, and weight loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Other neurologic causes of acute weakness</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple sclerosis (MS) &ndash; There are no clinical findings that are unique to MS, but some are highly characteristic of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63940\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63940 \">table 4</a>) while others are more common during initial presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61789\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61789 \">table 5</a>). The typical patient presents as a young adult with two or more clinically distinct episodes of CNS dysfunction with at least partial resolution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemiplegic migraine &ndash; This uncommon migraine variant is characterized by unilateral motor and sensory symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postictal (Todd's) paralysis &ndash; Generalized or complex partial seizures may be followed by a focal motor deficit that can persist for hours, but typically resolves within 30 to 60 minutes, and is often related to a structural abnormality of the brain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Other medical causes of generalized weakness</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothyroidism &ndash; Many of the manifestations of hypothyroidism reflect one of two changes induced by lack of thyroid hormone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62676 \">table 6</a>). The first is a generalized slowing of metabolic processes. This can lead to fatigue, slow movement and slow speech, cold intolerance, constipation, delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes, and bradycardia. The second is accumulation of matrix glycosaminoglycans in tissues, which can lead to coarse hair and skin, puffy facies, enlargement of the tongue, and hoarseness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &ndash; Occult infection, particularly in elderly patients, may manifest as malaise and generalized weakness.

Common culprits include beta blockers, diuretics, laxatives, chemotherapeutic agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>, opioids, and alcohol. Some agents may have direct toxic effects on muscle, including glucocorticoids, statins, antimalarial drugs, antipsychotic drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, antiretrovirals, alcohol, and cocaine.

As examples, fatigue is the most common complaint in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, occurring in over 80 percent of patients, and a common complaint among those with rheumatoid arthritis. Polymyalgia rheumatica, which can be associated with the vision-threatening condition of temporal arteritis, can present with generalized weakness and myalgias.

While some medications can cause myopathy directly (eg, glucocorticoids, statins), a number of medications can create problems in older patients through adverse reactions or drug interactions. Twenty percent of patients over 60 had symptoms attributable to prescription medications in one study of patients with a chief complaint of weakness or dizziness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-weakness-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

While this may be due to a primary neuromuscular process, more often the complaint represents malaise associated with a medical illness. Such an illness may include virtually the entire spectrum of medical pathology, including such serious conditions as sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, dehydration, severe hypokalemia, adrenal insufficiency, or hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis of acute weakness'</a> above.)</p><p>Other important definitions include paresis, which indicates partial or complete paralysis, and plegia, which indicates total loss of muscle contraction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to the history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a neurologic or neuromuscular problem is suspected, an algorithmic approach based upon a thorough history and examination facilitates neuroanatomic localization of the pathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54645\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54645 \">algorithm 1</a>). Exclusion of potentially life-threatening and other serious illness at each neuroanatomic site is an important part of this approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61895\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61895 \">table 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of life threatening illness'</a> below.)</p><p>The history should include a description of the distribution of weakness (eg, bilateral hands) and its manifestations (eg, difficulty with fine motor tasks), the period over which symptoms developed, and clinical features associated with the weakness (eg, aphasia, diplopia).

A localized process (eg, weakness and paresthesias limited to one or two fingers) suggests peripheral nerve entrapment, although distinguishing spinal from peripheral nerve entrapment can be challenging in some instances. Familiarity with cervical and lumbosacral dermatomes and myotomes helps with recognition of spinal nerve root compression, and may help to differentiate this from peripheral pathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74632\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74632 \">table 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64209\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64209 \">table 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50419\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75974 \">table 10</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Bilateral weakness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important questions to consider when evaluating a patient with bilateral weakness include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is mental status depressed?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which limbs are involved?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there sensory involvement?

The presence of bladder dysfunction or a sensory deficit below a discrete dermatomal level suggests a myelopathy.</p><p>The proximal motor weakness typically found early in the course of a myopathy is suggested by difficulty walking up stairs or getting up from a chair, if the lower limbs are involved, or difficulty with overhead activities (eg, combing hair), if the upper extremities are involved.</p><p>Symptoms associated with disease at the neuromuscular junction include visual symptoms, particularly ptosis and diplopia, and bulbar signs. Bulbar muscle weakness may manifest as nasal speech, coughing, or lingual dysarthria.

A more detailed examination must be performed in patients with symptoms suggestive of a central process (eg, dysarthria, oculomotor or visual dysfunction, ataxia). The detailed examination should include careful assessment of cranial nerve and motor function. Performance of the neurologic examination is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor neuron findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recognition and distinction between upper motor neuron (UMN) or lower motor neuron (LMN) signs is important when determining the nature of a weakness syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56458\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56458 \">table 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62641\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62641 \">figure 3</a>). How to make this distinction between UMN and LMN lesions and localize spinal cord lesions are discussed in detail separately, but a few highlights are described below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Signs of UMN disease include spasticity (ie, increased muscle tone), hyperreflexia, and an extensor plantar response (Babinski reflex). These findings are absent in pure peripheral disease. However, hyporeflexia and flaccid paralysis may occur with acute central lesions, with hyperreflexia and spasticity developing later. An example of UMN disease encountered in the ED is the patient who presents with acute spinal cord transection from trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Signs of LMN disease include decreased muscle tone and hyporeflexia. The Babinski reflex is absent. If weakness is bilateral and signs of LMN disease are present, the major disorders to consider are neuropathies, myopathies, and disorders of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The distinguishing features of these processes are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75434 \">table 12</a>).</p><p>Neuropathies tend to involve distal muscle groups, while myopathies more often involve proximal muscles. Reflexes are decreased in neuropathies, but may be present, decreased, or absent with myopathies. Myopathies may have associated myalgias but sensory symptoms are generally absent. The most distinguishing feature of neuromuscular junction disease is early involvement of the bulbar musculature (ie, tongue, jaw, face, and larynx).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Strength testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strength testing is central to the examination of the weak patient. Clinicians should employ the standardized motor grading scale agreed upon by the Medical Research Council (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77388\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77388 \">table 13</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-weakness-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Using historical features as a guide, first try to identify if there is a pattern to the weakness. Hemiparesis suggests a hemispheric lesion; paraparesis suggests a spinal cord lesion. Peripheral nerve disease, notably Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, can also cause paraparesis.</p><p>If the history suggests a proximal pattern of weakness, such as difficulty walking up stairs or difficulty standing from a chair, seek to distinguish proximal from distal muscle weakness. Proximal weakness suggests a myopathic process rather than a neuropathy. Strength testing of specific muscle groups is useful when assessing isolated extremity weakness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58656\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58656 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64884\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64884 \">figure 5</a>). If pathology at the NMJ is suspected, oculomotor and bulbar testing are critical. Assess extraocular movements, eyelid strength, masseter muscle strength, facial expression, and palatal movement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Reflex testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reflex testing aids in the diagnosis and the localization of nerve lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74632\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74632 \">table 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75645 \">table 14</a>). Tendon jerks are graded using a standard scale, with zero representing absence and four representing hyperactivity with clonus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82522\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82522 \">table 15</a>).</p><p>Lesions in one cerebral hemisphere generally result in hyperreflexia of the affected side due to disruption of the UMN. Interruption of the corticospinal tracts bilaterally generally causes symmetrical hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses (positive Babinski). A spinal cord lesion is the most common cause of such findings, but in rare instances, bilateral cerebral hemisphere damage or brainstem disease may be present.</p><p>Nerve root compression most often causes unilateral absence of a specific lower extremity reflex. As an example, unilateral loss of the ankle jerk suggests a lesion at the S1 nerve root.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Fatigability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigability describes normal strength during initial testing that decreases significantly as testing continues. It is characteristic of myasthenia gravis. Maneuvers, such as the ice test or Tensilon test can be performed to diagnose NMJ pathology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Bedside tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensation testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the presence, pattern, or absence of sensory symptoms and signs can be helpful in confirming the neuroanatomic level producing weakness, the subjective nature of sensory findings makes interpretation challenging. Classically, a cortical lesion causes relatively mild hemisensory loss, which affects touch and proprioception more than pain. The patient may simply describe this as their arm or leg &quot;feeling funny.&quot; A spinal cord lesion often affects sensation bilaterally, with the upper level of the sensory loss defining the lesion level.</p><p>In contrast, cervical central cord lesions most commonly produce a &quot;cape&quot; sensory loss over the shoulders affecting pain and temperature sensation, but spares vibration and proprioception (so-called &quot;dissociated&quot; sensory loss). Lesions of the conus medullaris or cauda equina produce loss of sensation in the perineum. When the lateral half of the spinal cord is damaged (Brown-Sequard syndrome) proprioception and vibration are lost ipsilateral to the lesion, while pain and temperature sensation are lost on the contralateral side.</p><p>In the case of more localized sensory loss in a limb, familiarity with dermatomes and peripheral nerve sensory distributions helps to differentiate a spinal root lesion from that of a peripheral nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50419\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54042\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54042 \">figure 6</a>). The absence of sensory symptoms in such cases suggests the weakness stems from a myopathy or NMJ disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">ANCILLARY STUDIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of diagnostic testing performed on a weak patient in the emergency department (ED) varies depending upon the differential diagnosis and the potential pace of deterioration of any neuromuscular process being considered. As examples, a potentially septic patient with no obvious source of infection undergoes extensive diagnostic testing, a patient with a possible acute ischemic stroke requires an emergent head computed tomography (CT), and most patients with a presumed peripheral nerve entrapment require no diagnostic testing in the ED.</p><p>For many patients with generalized weakness, it is reasonable to obtain a hemoglobin concentration and electrolyte panel testing. A hemoglobin measurement identifies anemia while a standard electrolyte panel enables assessment of serum glucose, potassium, sodium, and renal function. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a reasonable screening tool in elderly patients with generalized weakness and in patients with an abnormal potassium or calcium level. Beyond these baseline tests, a focused differential diagnosis determines further testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulse oximetry provides a reasonable index of oxygenation but is insensitive for identifying patients with significant neuromuscular disease. Arterial blood gas measurement may not be helpful in establishing the likelihood of imminent respiratory failure, because the pCO<sub>2</sub> can rise precipitously as diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle weakness progresses with neuromuscular disease.</p><p>Patients with such diseases commonly lose tidal volume before upper airway weakness develops, resulting in an increased respiratory rate to maintain minute ventilation. In such cases, the pCO<sub>2</sub> may remain normal or low until the tidal volume becomes dangerously low.</p><p>For this reason, selected pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are needed to determine the degree of respiratory compromise and to aid in the decision to intubate patients with suspected neuromuscular disease, such as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) or myasthenia gravis (MG). As always, patients determined to be in respiratory distress or in danger of imminent respiratory compromise are intubated based upon clinical assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-decision-to-intubate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The decision to intubate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The specific tests that can be used to assess respiratory function are described separately.

A head CT without contrast is performed when a cortical process must be assessed. CT identifies acute hemorrhage, mass lesions, and cerebral edema in the great majority of cases, but may appear normal in the early stages of ischemic stroke. A head CT with contrast is obtained if an intracranial tumor or certain infections (eg, toxoplasmic encephalitis) are suspected.

The first important step in this approach is to determine whether the weakness is unilateral (asymmetric) or bilateral (symmetric), and to look closely for signs of central neurologic involvement.</p><p>In the assessment of both unilateral and bilateral weakness, it is helpful to begin cephalad and centrally and then progress caudad and peripherally. This approach provides a reliable framework for neuroanatomic localization and accurate diagnosis.</p><p>If unilateral weakness is identified, look carefully for signs suggestive of cortical, subcortical (lacunar), or brainstem lesions. If these are absent, a peripheral process (radiculopathy, plexopathy, or peripheral nerve injury) most likely accounts for the patient's symptoms. Key questions for assessing unilateral weakness include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are cortical signs present (eg, aphasia, neglect, agnosia, apraxia)?

Aphasia usually corresponds to a left hemispheric stroke, since the left cerebral hemisphere controls language function in the majority of both right-handed and left-handed individuals. A nonfluent (Broca's) aphasia often accompanies a right hemiplegia of cortical origin, since the motor cortex is in close proximity to Broca's area.

Cortical sensory loss accompanies the hemiplegia if the sensory cortex, located across the Rolandic fissure, is involved.

The simultaneous occurrence of bilateral, symmetric lesions of the motor cortex is highly unlikely, but a lesion in the interhemispheric fissure, such as a parasagittal meningioma, could result in paraparesis simulating a spinal cord lesion. This is because the areas involved with lower extremity function lie on the medial sides of the motor strip of each cerebral cortex and face each other in the interhemispheric fissure.</p><p>A small lesion at the decussation of the pyramids (cruciate paralysis of Bell) can cause bilateral paralysis of the upper extremities, with no involvement of the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-weakness-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].

Discrete dermatomal sensory loss may not be obvious on examination.</p><p>Myelopathy is generally diagnosed by history and physical examination, and confirmed by MRI. Emergent consultation with a spine surgeon is essential if an epidural compression syndrome is suspected, since prognosis depends upon the patient's neurologic function at the time of intervention.

Weakness typically begins in the proximal muscles and extends distally thereafter. Deep tendon reflexes are often maintained until severe weakness develops.

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The emergency clinician's first responsibility is to rule out life-threatening or permanently disabling causes of weakness that require urgent treatment. The immediate life threats from acute neuromuscular weakness include inability to protect or maintain the airway, respiratory failure from thoracic and diaphragmatic muscle weakness, and circulatory collapse from autonomic instability. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of life threatening illness'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke should be rapidly evaluated to determine appropriate treatment with systemic thrombolytic therapy or emergency endovascular revascularization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once life-threatening problems have been addressed or ruled out, the clinician approaches the patient with objective weakness in a systematic manner, as outlined in the accompanying algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54645\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54645 \">algorithm 1</a>). The first important step in this approach is to determine whether the weakness is unilateral (asymmetric) or bilateral (symmetric), and to look closely for signs of central neurologic involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When assessing acute weakness, it is helpful to begin cephalad and centrally and then progress caudad and peripherally. This approach provides a reliable framework for neuroanatomic localization and accurate diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If unilateral weakness is identified, look carefully for signs suggestive of cortical, subcortical (lacunar), or brainstem lesions. If these are absent, a peripheral process (radiculopathy, plexopathy, or peripheral nerve injury) most likely accounts for the patient's symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If bilateral weakness is identified, consider the patient's mental status and look carefully for signs of upper or lower motor neuron lesions and associated abnormalities. The constellation of examination findings should allow approximate identification of the site of the lesion and determination of the need for imaging studies, specialist consultation, and treatment.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-weakness-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">McGillicuddy DC, Walker O, Shapiro NI, Edlow JA.
