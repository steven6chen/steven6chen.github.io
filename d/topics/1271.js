This topic review will provide an overview of postoperative jaundice and a suggested approach for evaluation and management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no widely accepted classification of postoperative jaundice. Nevertheless, postoperative jaundice can be considered a part of a spectrum of abnormal liver biochemical tests, which are common in the postoperative period. A subset of patients who develop abnormal liver biochemical tests have preexisting liver disease, increasing their vulnerability to further hepatic injury from a variety of causes. Others develop liver biochemical abnormalities without preexisting liver disease. The distinction is potentially important since it can help clarify contributing causes, influence prognosis, and may guide long-term management.</p><p>We have found it useful conceptually to subdivide postoperative jaundice into three categories: prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prehepatic, which results from overproduction of bilirubin such as from hemolysis or a resolving hematoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrahepatic, which results from injury to hepatocytes or biliary epithelial cells and is due to a variety of causes such as hepatic ischemia, infection, and drug toxicity. All of these conditions may be more likely and clinically more severe in patients with preexisting liver disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posthepatic, which is due to obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tree. Examples include a retained common bile duct stone or a direct biliary tract injury from upper abdominal surgery.</p><p/><p>These categories are not mutually exclusive since several factors are typically involved in causing postoperative jaundice. The clinical challenge is considering the multitude of causes in an effort to determine if intervention is possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREHEPATIC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overproduction of unconjugated bilirubin can lead to jaundice. In the surgical setting, overproduction is usually due either to pathologic red blood cell breakdown (hemolysis) or erythrocyte breakdown after excessive bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and causes of jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia&quot;, section on 'Disorders associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bilirubin-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bilirubin metabolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemolysis can result from a transfusion reaction with certain medications or from mechanical effects due to shearing forces from exposure of red blood cells to intravascular devices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Warm agglutinins and drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Pain, fever, or chills around the time of red blood cell transfusion, coupled with dark urine, suggest a transfusion reaction as the cause of jaundice. Surgery can exacerbate hemolysis in patients with a preexisting hemolytic disease or a genetic predisposition to hemolysis (eg, sickle cell disease, hereditary spherocytosis, Gilbert syndrome or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency).</p><p>Patients who have undergone surgery that exposes the blood flow to shearing forces (eg, cardiopulmonary bypass) can develop unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to mechanical red blood cell breakdown. Patients at greatest risk include young children, patients who have undergone extensive surgery with a long operative time, patients with preoperative heart failure and congestive hepatopathy, and patients who have received prolonged hemodynamic support from a ventricular assist devices, intra-aortic balloon pump, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-postoperative-jaundice/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythrocyte breakdown occurs in patients with internal bleeding, with subsequent resorption of the extravasated blood. Surgical trauma patients who have multiple injuries to muscle and soft tissue may be at particular risk. In other patients, a declining hematocrit may be a clue that jaundice is, at least in part, due to resorption of extravasated blood. Trauma patients with hemorrhage are also more likely to require blood transfusions, the breakdown of which can compound the jaundice seen in these patients. A review of case series and reports of jaundice in trauma patients showed that an overproduction of bilirubin due to hemolysis of transfused blood and breakdown of extravasated blood was the most common causative factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-postoperative-jaundice/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAHEPATIC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple insults in the perioperative period can lead to hepatocellular or canalicular dysfunction, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>, hypoxia, ischemia, drugs, newly acquired viral hepatitis, and sepsis.</p><p>As noted above, liver dysfunction associated with perioperative insults may be more likely and clinically more severe in patients with preexisting liver disease. The clinical course depends upon the type of liver disease, its severity, the surgical procedure, and the type of anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessing surgical risk in patients with liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Underlying liver disease is not always recognized during preoperative evaluation. Thus, the possibility that underlying liver disease could be contributing to jaundice should be considered. The following will summarize some of the important causes of intrahepatic jaundice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver's complex vascular supply and high metabolic activity make it particularly vulnerable to circulatory disturbances. Ischemic hepatitis (also referred to as shock liver) refers to diffuse hepatic injury resulting from acute hypoperfusion. The hemodynamic insult is usually evident clinically before liver injury is recognized. Liver injury is typically recognized by a rapid rise in serum aminotransferase levels and an early massive rise in lactate dehydrogenase levels. Peak aminotransferase levels are usually reached one to three days after the hemodynamic insult and can be 25 to 250 times the upper limit of normal. Ischemic hepatitis is often accompanied by additional evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion, especially acute tubular necrosis of the kidney. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-hepatitis-hepatic-infarction-and-ischemic-cholangiopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic hepatitis, hepatic infarction, and ischemic cholangiopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug-induced liver injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) occurs with many drugs through a variety of mechanisms. Diagnosis can be difficult since the relationship between drug exposure and hepatic toxicity is not always clear, although supportive features are onset after beginning the drug and improvement after withdrawal. Although contemporary inhaled anesthetic agents uncommonly cause DILI, the degree of hepatic metabolisms correlates with the likelihood of a toxic reaction. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Isoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> undergo less hepatic metabolism than halothane or enflurane and have the lowest risk of hepatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessing surgical risk in patients with liver disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-liver-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced liver injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Total parenteral nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) in critically ill patients has been associated with postoperative jaundice. In one study, 30 percent of patients receiving TPN had liver dysfunction as defined by biochemical evidence of cholestasis, liver necrosis, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-postoperative-jaundice/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The use of excessive caloric amounts of TPN was noted to be a risk factor for liver dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral hepatitis is an uncommon cause of postoperative jaundice, but can occur in the rare case of hospital outbreaks or in patients with preoperative exposure. The exacerbation of underlying chronic hepatitis B is also possible in patients with chronic infection, particularly in patients receiving immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTHEPATIC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary obstruction related to choledocholithiasis, biliary stricture, or bile leaks remains one of the most common cause of postoperative jaundice in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Patients undergoing cholecystectomy, pancreatic surgery, or resections of tumors of the liver, gallbladder, or bile ducts are at particular risk.</p><p>Surgery performed near the periphery of the bile ducts or gallbladder is associated with a risk of a bile leak or a stricture from dysfunctional biliary epithelial healing. A bile duct stricture can be due to surgical scarring or a narrow anastomosis. Bile leaks can occasionally present with jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia. In addition, patients undergoing cholecystectomy can retain stones in the bile ducts, causing obstruction. An unintended interruption or obstruction (eg, due to clips) in the bile duct can become clinically evident immediately or days after surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Bile leaks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bile leaks after upper abdominal surgery are most commonly due to injury to the bile ducts or the ducts of Luschka. The ducts of Luschka are small ducts occasionally present at the gallbladder fossa, originating from the right hepatic lobe and draining into the extrahepatic bile ducts. Most leaks are symptomatic and detected during the first week following surgery. Endoscopic therapy is successful in resolving approximately 90 percent of bile leaks after cholecystectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of complications from laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Biliary strictures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of bile duct strictures after upper abdominal surgery depends on the location of the stricture, its severity, and the extent of delay until its recognition. Endoscopic and surgical approaches may be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-complications-from-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of complications from laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Acalculous cholecystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acalculous cholecystitis is an acute necroinflammatory disease of the gallbladder with a multifactorial pathogenesis. It can occur in any hospitalized patient, but most frequently it occurs in the critically ill. In the critically ill, who may be intubated and sedated, it may present with unexplained fever, leukocytosis, or vague abdominal discomfort. Abnormal liver biochemical tests may include hyperbilirubinemia, a mild increase in serum alkaline phosphatase and aminotransferase levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acalculous cholecystitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTIFACTORIAL CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, postoperative jaundice is usually attributable to more than one cause. The following conditions are examples of causes that have several contributing mechanisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign postoperative jaundice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;benign postoperative jaundice&quot; was added to the medical lexicon to recognize the common occurrence of postoperative jaundice from a multifactorial etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-postoperative-jaundice/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Because the term encompasses a multitude of potentially contributing causes, it is not particularly helpful for identifying specific contributing causes that could potentially be amenable to intervention. Nevertheless, it still provides a useful description for patients with multiple possible causes of postoperative jaundice.</p><p>The clinical features are overshadowed by those of the underlying condition. One review found that patients can develop severe jaundice with bilirubin levels as high as 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-postoperative-jaundice/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Aminotransferase levels are usually less than five times the upper limit of normal, while the alkaline phosphatase levels are usually less than four times the upper limits of normal.</p><p>The diagnosis remains one that depends upon excluding other causes, especially those that are amenable to intervention. A liver biopsy is rarely required, but when it has been performed, it has shown centrilobular congestion and cholestasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-postoperative-jaundice/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Despite the name, the course is not always benign. Prognosis depends mainly upon the underlying condition. In those who recover, jaundice will resolve gradually over weeks to months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe bacterial infections are commonly associated with cholestasis. Contributing causes include hypotension, hemolysis, medications, and bacterial endotoxins, which downregulate bilirubin and bile salt transporters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and causes of jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia&quot;, section on 'Sepsis and low perfusion states'</a>.)</p><p>In one review of the literature, the total bilirubin was between 5 and 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> the alkaline phosphatase between two to three times the upper limit of normal, and the aminotransferases only mildly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-postoperative-jaundice/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Diagnosis is usually established by the clinical context and exclusion of other causes. A liver biopsy is generally not needed. In one review of biopsies obtained immediately after death in 15 patients with sepsis, the most common findings were centrilobular necrosis (80 percent), portal inflammation (73 percent), steatosis (73 percent), lobular inflammation (67 percent), hepatocellular apoptosis (67 percent), and <span class=\"nowrap\">cholangitis/cholangiolitis</span> (20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-postoperative-jaundice/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation is based upon a careful history, review of medications, perioperative course, and laboratory and imaging tests. The following checklist can help to guide evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have known liver disease or risk factors for liver disease such as a history of alcoholism, intravenous drug use, a family history of liver disease?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there any preoperative liver biochemical tests or imaging tests?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there postoperative imaging tests?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the patient receive transfusions?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What was blood loss around surgery?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was this a trauma patient with significant soft-tissue bleeding?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the patient receive a cardiopulmonary bypass or an intra-aortic balloon pump?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the patient have upper abdominal surgery in which the bile duct could have been injured?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have heart failure now, or did the patient have heart failure preoperatively?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the pattern of liver biochemical and other laboratory tests provide clues? For example, does the patient have evidence of hemolysis (eg, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, circulating spherocytic red cells, increased lactic dehydrogenase concentration, reduced serum haptoglobin, increased reticulocyte count or percentage)? Did the aminotransferases rise to high levels that could be supportive of ischemic hepatitis?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What type of anesthesia did the patient receive?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the patient receive drugs known to be associated with drug-induced liver disease?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was the patient septic?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient febrile?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have stigmata of chronic liver disease (eg, spider angiomata, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and gynecomastia)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have right upper quadrant pain?</p><p/><p>Further diagnostic evaluation should be based upon the history obtained above. As a general rule, we obtain a right upper quadrant ultrasound if imaging has not already been performed. A CT scan, MRI, or MRCP may also be needed, depending on the clinical context. We also obtain hepatitis serology (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HCV ab or RNA, HAV IgM).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management and prognosis depend upon the underlying cause and the identification of causes for which specific intervention is possible. As noted above, patients with biliary tract obstruction from bile duct injury may require endoscopic, radiologic, or surgical intervention. Patients in whom drug-induced liver injury is suspected should receive alternative medications. Patients with acalculous cholecystitis should receive appropriate percutaneous or surgical therapy. In other patients, the clinical course largely depends upon the resolution of the underlying condition (such as sepsis). Jaundice will resolve in weeks to months after the underlying causes have resolved.</p><p>Patients with severe cholestasis may have an elevated prothrombin time, which may respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a>. Prolonged cholestasis may lead to malabsorption of fats and other fat soluble vitamins, and thus nutritional evaluation may be required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H775208680\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
