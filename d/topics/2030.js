VWF is also important in fibrin formation, acting as a carrier for factor VIII in the circulation, maintaining the normal level of factor VIII by decreasing the clearance of factor VIII fivefold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>A bleeding disorder called von Willebrand disease (VWD) occurs when VWF is deficient or qualitatively abnormal. VWD is the most common of the inherited bleeding disorders, with an estimated prevalence in the general population of 1 percent by laboratory testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Symptomatic VWD is less common, approximately 0.01 percent, as estimated in hemostasis clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although it is primarily a congenital disorder, there are also acquired forms of the disease.</p><p>Evaluation of patients with these disorders has improved our understanding of the functions of VWF and the pathophysiology of VWD. This has taken on greater importance as the role of VWF in thrombotic diseases, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and other forms of VWF-mediated thrombosis, is being increasingly recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>], and the use of new therapies for inhibiting VWF interactions is being explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The biology and normal functions of VWF will be reviewed here.</p><p>Diagnosis and management of disorders associated with deficient or abnormal VWF (eg, inherited VWD, acquired von Willebrand syndrome) are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathophysiology of inherited VWD &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathophysiology of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of inherited VWD &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of inherited VWD &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis and treatment of acquired VWS &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired von Willebrand syndrome&quot;</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGY OF VWF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gene for VWF is located on the short arm of chromosome 12 and is composed of 178 kilobases (kb) and 52 exons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]; the VWF mRNA contains approximately 9 kb. A pseudogene is present on chromosome 22 that includes exons 23-34 of the VWF gene; these exons correspond to regions of the authentic gene that encode domains A1, A2, and A3 (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Domain structure'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Synthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Von Willebrand factor is synthesized in endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and megakaryocytes as a primary translation product of 2813 amino acids; it subsequently undergoes considerable processing, including dimerization and multimerization to very large forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The primary translation product contains a signal peptide of 22 amino acids followed by a propeptide of 741 residues, also known as VWF propeptide (von Willebrand antigen II) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], and a mature subunit of 2050 amino acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Dimerization occurs early during processing of the protein by formation of disulfide bonds between the C-terminal ends of the pro-VWF within the endoplasmic reticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The addition of N-linked carbohydrate residues also occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, a process that is critical to the formation of dimers and subsequent exit from this compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The pro-VWF dimers are transported to the Golgi, where further glycosylation and sulfation occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and multimers are formed by disulfide bond formation between the N-termini of the pro-dimers. Cleavage of the prosequence occurs at approximately the same time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Multimers of a spectrum of sizes are formed, some of which are exceedingly large, more than 20 million daltons. The presence of the propeptide is necessary for multimer formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], as is a low pH environment and calcium ions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Synthesis of VWF is regulated in part by hormones. As an example, VWF production in endothelial cells is increased by both estrogen and thyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], and increased estrogen levels during pregnancy lead to higher levels of VWF during the second and third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Storage and secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The smaller multimers of VWF, which represent the majority of the newly synthesized protein, are constitutively secreted from endothelial cells and megakaryocytes, while the remaining VWF, which includes the larger multimers, is targeted to cytoplasmic storage granules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. The storage granules in the endothelial cells (Weibel-Palade bodies) contain these larger VWF multimers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] in addition to the cleaved VWF propeptide; they also contain a number of other proteins including a cell adhesion molecule (P-selectin), tissue plasminogen activator, a lysosomal membrane sialoglycoprotein (CD63), and angiopoietin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>].</p><p>The formation of Weibel-Palade bodies and the role of VWF in their formation has been studied extensively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. The presence of VWF is crucial for the formation of Weibel-Palade bodies, and VWF tubule formation and VWF's role in the recruitment of other proteins to Weibel-Palade bodies is being clarified. Weibel-Palade bodies and the alpha granules of platelets serve as storage site for VWF and P-selectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Coalescence of the Weibel-Palade bodies to form pods occurs before VWF secretion and formation of VWF strings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. P-selectin anchors VWF as it is secreted from the Weibel-Palade bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], and string formation of the anchored, newly synthesized multimers plays a role in promoting the cleavage of ultralarge prothrombotic VWF multimers by ADAMTS13, removing them from the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. These processes may yield further targets for treatment modalities for thrombotic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Active secretion of the larger, most functional forms of VWF from the storage sites occurs in response to a number of physiologic agonists, including alpha-adrenergic agonists (such as epinephrine), thrombin, fibrin, and histamine, and after the administration of the vasopressin analogue DDAVP; G proteins play a role in the secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. DDAVP is used therapeutically to raise VWF levels in disorders such as VWD and uremic platelet dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/47,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,49</a>]; the mechanism by which it releases VWF is not fully understood, but activation of the endothelial vasopressin V2R receptor and c-AMP mediated signaling are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma VWF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma VWF concentrations vary widely among healthy individuals. The normal concentration of VWF in plasma is 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span>. Platelets contain approximately 15 percent of the quantity of VWF present in an equal quantity of platelet-poor plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. All of the factors responsible for the variability in VWF levels are not clear, but polymorphisms in the VWF gene appear to be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. In addition, post-translational changes affecting the carbohydrate structure of VWF can modify the clearance of the protein, causing variation in VWF levels. A number of cell receptors are implicated in the clearance of VWF. (See <a href=\"#H1551978020\" class=\"local\">'Clearance of VWF from the circulation'</a> below.)</p><p>A portion of the carbohydrate structure in VWF is related to ABO blood type, and it has a major influence: the plasma concentration of VWF in adults with type O blood is approximately 25 to 30 percent lower than those with types A, B, or AB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This occurs because a portion of the carbohydrate present on VWF is identical to the blood groups and influences the clearance of VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/56-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-63</a>]. These physiologic differences may not be present during the first year of life, perhaps related to the slow postnatal development of the blood group system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">VWF multimers and ADAMTS13</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spectrum of VWF multimers released by agents such as DDAVP, thrombin, and collagen includes larger multimers than those usually present in the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Processing of the ultralarge VWF multimers (ULVWF) takes place in the plasma within about four hours and is mediated by the metalloproteinase ADAMTS13, which is synthesized in, and released from, hepatic stellate cells, megakaryocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>]. This enzyme converts the larger multimers into the slightly smaller forms normally present in the circulation by cleaving VWF in its A2 domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/70-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-76</a>]. Cleavage likely occurs preferentially on strings of VWF tethered to the endothelial surface and complexed with platelets; the fluid shear stress acting on VWF so tethered reveals the scissile bond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. In vitro studies performed under static conditions have shown that ADAMTS13 is constitutively released from the Golgi of endothelial cells; it attaches along the entire length of the VWF molecule where it cleaves the newly formed VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Factor VIII plays a role in accelerating the proteolysis of these ULVWF multimers by ADAMTS13, and factor H, also released by endothelial cells, plays an inhibiting role in this cleavage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>].</p><p>The coding sequence of ADAMTS13 reveals that the protein is a member of the ADAMTS family of metalloproteinases (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with ThromboSpondin motifs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>].</p><p>The physiologic importance of the ADAMTS13 protease is illustrated by the increased incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in patients with antibodies against, or congenital deficiency of, this enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In addition, animal studies have revealed that spontaneous thrombi are formed in microvenules in ADAMTS13<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">-/-</sup></span> mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. In animal models of ADAMTS13 inhibition, co-inhibition of the VWF-GP1b interaction was shown to abrogate thrombus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. In vitro evidence indicates that some inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin-8) may stimulate the release of ULVWF and others may inhibit ULVWF cleavage (eg, interleukin-6), suggesting a linkage between inflammation and thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas#H199371\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of acquired TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)&quot;, section on 'Deficient ADAMTS13 activity'</a>.)</p><p>Another mechanism may play a role in the processing of the unusually large multimers. Thrombospondin-1, by acting as a protein disulfide reductase, has been shown to reversibly generate new thiol groups in VWF and reduce the size of the multimers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The relationship and relative importance of the ADAMTS13 protease and thrombospondin-1 in the determination of the size of plasma VWF multimers in humans is not fully understood. However, there is evidence in mice that thrombospondin inhibits the activity of ADAMTS13, perhaps by competing with the protease for access to VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>After processing, plasma VWF consists of a series of multimers varying in size from tetramers to multimers of over 40 subunits (greater than 20 million daltons); the basic repeating unit is either a dimer or a tetramer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>]. VWF circulates as flexible 2 nm thick strands in a tangled coil configuration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Its structure becomes more linear under conditions of high shear stress such as those observed in small vessels or vessels narrowed by atherosclerotic plaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The linear conformation appears to be the functional form for binding to the platelet receptor, glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), which mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation under conditions of high shear (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. The normal half-life of circulating VWF is approximately 8 to 12 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Domain structure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The VWF protein is composed of a series of homologous domains, with most regions repeated three to six times.

The C domains have also been divided into six C regions based on structural studies and by homology with the known structure of other proteins. Platelet binding via the integrin alphaIIb-beta3 is assigned to C4. The CTCK crystal structure has revealed a highly reinforced dimerization interface; this extremely strong binding surface explains how large VWF multimers can assemble and resist the exceptionally high shear forces from blood flow at sites of clot formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p>Each mature VWF monomer contains binding sites for collagen, platelet integrins, factor VIII, and other VWF monomers. Since the larger VWF multimers contain repeated binding sites, they are well suited to act as bridging molecules between platelets and the vascular subendothelium: The repeated binding sites allow multiple interactions with both platelet receptors and subendothelial structures at sites of vessel injury.

Thrombosis occurred as expected in pigs with normal plasma VWF and no platelet VWF, while no thrombosis occurred in pigs with absent plasma VWF but normal platelet VWF.

Binding to platelets requires initial activation or alteration in the structure of VWF so that the binding sites in the A1 domain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60152 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/102-104,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">102-104,112</a>] can engage the platelet receptor GPIb-IX-V complex on the platelet surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/96,113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,113,114</a>].

Vimentin, a structural protein found in plasma and on the surface of platelets, has been shown to enhance the binding of VWF to the platelet surface under high shear stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p>One or both of the following mechanisms may be important in the &quot;activation&quot; of circulating VWF:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Activation&quot; may occur as VWF binds to subendothelial structures exposed after endothelial damage, possibly by immobilizing the protein, thus exposing multiple VWF A1 domains toward the vessel lumen where platelets are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Activation&quot; may occur when VWF is exposed to the high shear stresses that are present in small arterioles and atherosclerotic arteries (shear rates <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1000/second)</span>. In this setting, the conformation of VWF changes from a globular form to a linear form in which the A1 domains are available for binding to the platelet GPIb receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p/><p>Studies have shown that beta 2 glycoprotein I acts to inhibit the binding of &quot;activated&quot; VWF to GPIb and decreases platelet adhesion. Beta 2 glycoprotein I itself binds to VWF and inhibits the interaction between VWF and platelet glycoprotein Ib. In some autoimmune settings, antibodies to beta 2 glycoprotein I remove this inhibition of VWF binding and may contribute to thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">118,119</a>].

The platelet alphaIIb-beta3-VWF interaction appears to contribute to the final, irreversible binding of platelets to the subendothelium after VWF has bound to GPIb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. The alphaIIb-beta3 interaction with VWF may also contribute to platelet aggregation, especially under high shear conditions; under low shear conditions platelet aggregation is mediated primarily by alphaIIb-beta3 binding to fibrinogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/115,121-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">115,121-123</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Binding to subendothelium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precise components in the subendothelial connective tissue to which VWF binds are not all defined.

Binding of collagen types I and III may also be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. Collagen binding appears to induce a conformational change within the factor VIII-binding motif of VWF that lowers the affinity of VWF for factor VIII, perhaps releasing factor VIII locally to aid in the formation of the fibrin clot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Carrier function for factor VIII</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factor VIII is an important protein cofactor in the pathway of thrombin generation.

The low factor VIII concentration in VWD is due, at least in part, to the decreased levels of VWF, since VWF normally protects factor VIII from proteolytic inactivation by activated protein C and its cofactor protein S [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/100,107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,107,108</a>].

With VWF present, the inactivation of factor VIII by activated protein C is slowed 10- to 20-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>]; without this protection, the half-life of factor VIII is only about two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

After thrombin cleavage, activated factor VIII (fVIIIa) is released from VWF and becomes a fully functional, active cofactor in ongoing thrombin generation, and it can then be inactivated by activated protein C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1551978020\"><span class=\"h2\">Clearance of VWF from the circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clearance of VWF from the circulation has more than one mechanism. VWF contains both O-linked and N-linked glycan residues, and the N-linked glycans can bind to receptors on hepatic and splenic macrophages, including the lipoprotein receptor (LRP1). LRP1 has been shown to bind and increase the clearance of the &quot;activated&quot; VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. N-linked sites within the VWF A1 and A2 domains that are exposed by the unfolding of VWF via shear stress are able to bind to the LRP1 receptor and mediate clearance. These include galectin 1 and 2 (Gal-1 and Gal-3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. Siglet-5, also expressed on macrophages, and CLEC4M, expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver and spleen, also regulate VWF clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/135,136\" class=\"abstract_t\">135,136</a>]. It has long been speculated that the altered glycosylation of VWF in type O blood also increases clearance by a related mechanism. A different receptor, the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Ashwell receptor), may bind and clear VWF with a decreased quantity of sialic acid residues, which may occur during infection or with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. Additional receptors may also play a role. The physiologic importance of increased clearance is shown in type 2B VWD by the clearance of the abnormal 2B VWF bound to platelets; the complex of both the platelet and its bound VWF is cleared via the LRP1 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. Additionally in VWF Vicenza, a variant in which VWF levels fall because of very rapid clearance, it has been shown that clearance proceeds in an LRP1 and macrophage-dependent manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/138,139\" class=\"abstract_t\">138,139</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84895732\"><span class=\"h2\">Other functions of VWF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional functions of VWF include roles in inflammation, such as leukocyte extravasation and recruitment to the endothelial cell surface and regulation of complement activation; VWF also plays roles in angiogenesis, angiodysplasia, cell proliferation, and apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor/abstract/140,141\" class=\"abstract_t\">140,141</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H778077959\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major functions of VWF are promoting normal platelet adhesion and aggregation at high shear rates, and stabilizing unactivated factor VIII in the plasma.
