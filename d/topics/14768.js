Medical imaging may contribute less to total radiation exposure in other countries, however; 2005 data from the United Kingdom, for example, suggest that an average annual dose of imaging accounted for approximately one-sixth of annual exposure to ionizing radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will present an overview of the measurement of radiation associated with medical imaging, the effects of radiation exposure, the radiation associated with specific diagnostic imaging studies, and issues in clinical decision-making, including informed consent.

Among participants in managed care plans in the United States, for whom there would be no financial incentive to promote excess testing, increased use of computed tomography (CT) resulted in a doubling of per capita radiation exposure between 1996 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although the immediate and long-term benefits of medical imaging are widely discussed, their risks are often overlooked. The radiobiological detriment from a single exam is likely very small. However, the cumulative effect of small individual doses in a patient population undergoing frequent and often repeated imaging may present a public health concern for risks such as radiation-induced malignancies.</p><p>The majority of radiation from medical imaging arises from CT. Use of CT has grown exponentially over the last several decades. Almost three-quarters of all CT exams in the United States were ordered in acute care settings; in one large inner city hospital, the overall rate of CT exams ordered per patient doubled between 2001 and 2007, with the rate of chest CT exams increasing sixfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Based on extrapolation models from nuclear accident and atomic bomb survivors, one study estimates CT use may account for 1.5 to 2 percent of all future cancers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>CT is increasingly used to diagnose or exclude many life-threatening conditions. In the acute care setting, the most common indications for CT are trauma, stroke, and suspected pulmonary embolism. In the non-acute setting, the majority of CT imaging is in patients with cancer. In such settings, the short-term risk of a patient dying from the underlying illness far exceeds their lifetime risk of radiation-induced cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016120\"><span class=\"h1\">IONIZING RADIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ionizing radiation involves the detachment of electrons from subatomic particles or electromagnetic waves (eg, photons) at the atomic or molecular level, thus forming ions. Ionizing radiation is found in the natural environment in the form of radon or cosmic rays. Ionizing radiation is used for interventional and diagnostic radiology procedures, and in higher doses, for therapeutic and palliative procedures in the context of radiation oncology. With large catastrophic exposures, such as from an accident at a nuclear industrial facility, skin damage and acute radiation sickness may result. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and clinical features of radiation injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At the lower doses used in diagnostic and interventional procedures, ionizing radiation may cause DNA damage that increases the risk for future cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It should be noted that ionizing radiation causes structural damage at the cellular or molecular level, while non-ionizing radiation (which is not associated with medical imaging) causes damage through the transfer of heat (eg, microwave heating). Relative sources of exposure to ionizing radiation in the United States are shown in a figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61739\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61739 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016127\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proposed mechanism for cellular damage by ionizing radiation involves the production of free radicals. These free radicals interfere with chemical bonds between molecules that regulate key cellular processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Direct interaction between ionizing radiation and cellular macromolecules leads to DNA mutation or cell death, while indirect interaction causes free radical damage to essential cell enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Tissues are more or less susceptible to radiation injury, based on their rate of cellular proliferation and their degree of cellular differentiation. Thus, blood-forming (lymphoproliferative) organs with rapid cell turnover are the most sensitive, while nervous tissue with little or no cell turnover is the least sensitive. Relative radiosensitivities of different organs and tissues are listed in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68401 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The probability of occurrence of the chronic effects of ionizing radiation is a function of the total radiation dose, although the severity of effects cannot solely be attributed to radiation and is influenced by other factors (eg, environmental, genetic). While induction of future cancer is the effect of greatest concern, other potential outcomes include shortening of life span and cataract formation in the eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Radiation-induced cancers may develop decades after exposure, and include myeloma, leukemia, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, bone cancer, and skin cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016134\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose-response model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several theoretical dose-response models correlate radiation exposure with risk of developing cancer. There is controversy regarding the reliability of these models to predict cancer risk and there is a paucity of data to support or refute the use of one model over another. Of these, the linear no-threshold (LNT) model is the one most widely used. The LNT model provides a conservative risk estimate based on the assumption that any exposure to ionizing radiation, however small, can induce future cancer. It adheres to the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle of radiation safety designed to minimize radiation doses and release of radioactive materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/8,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13-15</a>]. </p><p>The LNT model is based on extrapolation of data from survivors of the Hiroshima atomic bomb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These data are used to project the cancer risk from estimates of very small radiation doses (eg, equivalent to a single chest radiograph). Other studies suggest that a meaningful threshold is not reached by very low dose radiologic studies, or that very low doses may even have a beneficial adaptive effect, fostering deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair and immune stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The US National Council on Radiological Protection and Measurements (NRCP) and the US National Academy of Sciences Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) committees suggest that LNT is the best model for estimating the possible risks of ionizing radiation, although recognizing that it may err on the side of caution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/8,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016148\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASURING RADIATION DOSE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016155\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several terms are used to describe different aspects of radiation and radiation dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiation exposure </strong>refers to the concentration of ionizing radiation in a specific volume of air, measured in roentgens (R).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absorbed dose</strong> signifies how much radiation is absorbed by a specific tissue, measured in grays (Gy) or rads.

It is the weighted average of doses to the irradiated organs and is measured in sieverts (Sv) or rems (100 rem = 1 Sv = 1000 mSv).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Effective dose, when applied using the linear no threshold model, can provide an estimate of the potential harms caused by low doses of radiation involved in diagnostic imaging. Projections on carcinogenesis, decreased life expectancy, and hereditary effects from ionizing radiation are derived at the population level.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016162\"><span class=\"h2\">Effective dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective dose is the method most commonly used in clinical practice and the medical literature to estimate a patient's risk of detriment from radiologic imaging. This detriment includes all cancers induced by exposure. Calculating the effective dose allows for comparison across different imaging modalities and spatial dose distributions. Additionally, the effective dose can be a useful parameter to weigh the potential benefits of the radiologic examination against the possible adverse effects of ionizing radiation.</p><p>The effective dose related to any radiologic exam or procedure can be considered in the context of the annual effective dose to individuals from natural background radiation sources, including radon, cosmic rays, terrestrial, and internal sources. This background effective dose is approximately 3 mSv. Exposure to an individual dose of 50 mSv or a lifetime dose of 100 mSv has not been associated with health risks; as such, these have been adopted as guidelines for upper thresholds for diagnostic imaging in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) estimates a 4 to 5 percent increased relative risk of fatal cancer after an average person receives a whole-body radiation dose of 1 Sv (1 Sv = 1000 mSv ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A retrospective study of claims data for 2005 to 2008 from an insurance database in the United States for approximately 950,000 enrollees aged 18 to 64 years found that nearly 70 percent of enrollees underwent at least one imaging exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The median effective dose from imaging per year was 0.1 mSv; moderate, high, and very high effective doses (&gt;3 to 20 mSv, &gt;20 to 50 mSv, and &gt;50 mSv, respectively) were incurred by 194, 19, and 2 enrollees per 1000 per year, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016169\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTIMATING RISK FROM RADIATION EXPOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No epidemiologic studies document a direct link between exposure to imaging exams or image-guided procedures and cancer. A deterministic effect between imaging, such as a diagnostic computed tomography (CT) exam, and cancer will undoubtedly be difficult to show.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147222742\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiologic basis for risk estimates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk estimates of radiation-induced cancer from medical imaging are mainly based on extrapolation of existing data from Japanese survivors of atomic bombings that took place in 1945 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Radiation doses to more than 100,000 individuals have been estimated based on the individuals' distance from atomic bomb epicenters; exposed individuals have been followed for cancer incidence and mortality for more than 60 years. Analysis of this patient registry demonstrates a linear relationship between the risk of developing any solid cancer and increasing radiation dose. However, this linear relationship is not observed when extrapolated below 100 mSv, in the range of doses conferred by diagnostic imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patient radiosensitivity is heavily dependent on age at the time of exposure, with children at greater risk of developing future radiation-induced cancer than adults.</p><p>Some experts believe that direct comparisons of radiation dose from CT exams and atomic bomb survivors can be made, without the need for extrapolation of existing data, since roughly one-third of the atomic bomb survivors studied were exposed to low radiation doses, in the range of single or multiple CT exams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This subpopulation of survivors had a small, but statistically significant, increased risk of developing future cancer after exposures in the range analogous to radiation associated with a single abdominal CT exam. However, for very low-dose radiologic exams, such as conventional radiography and mammography, the linear no-threshold model is still required to estimate possible cancer risks, and the actual risk associated with low dose medical imaging remains controversial.</p><p>While there are no data showing a causal relationship between actual medical examinations such as CT and cancer, there is epidemiologic evidence of future cancer development from exposure to X-rays and gamma rays. In the 1930s through the 1950s, repeat fluoroscopic exams were standard of care in tuberculosis patients, used to follow therapeutic pneumothoraces. The radiation doses for these fluoroscopic studies were slightly higher than current CT doses, and these patients were found to have an increased risk of developing breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In another study involving more than 400,000 nuclear industry workers in 15 nations, an excess relative risk for cancer deaths was identified, equivalent in magnitude to that found in Japanese atomic bomb survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016183\"><span class=\"h2\">Future cancer risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimating the risk of developing cancer from an individual imaging exam is controversial, given the stochastic nature of harm from ionizing radiation and the limited epidemiologic data. However, there is mounting consensus in the medical and scientific communities that the risk is real, however small to the individual.</p><p>To estimate the lifetime risk of developing cancer attributable to any single imaging exam for an individual patient, the American Society of Radiologic Technologists has an online <a href=\"http://www.xrayrisk.com/calculator/calculator.php&amp;token=889nBtkLJFc0tqUfuBgqcirXgTB2zuPvA06jlTNrzRUAtjLndB6mI2c/+m0L8SZYrwC1JCwUsNIWoeWxLU0oqw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=14613\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">radiation risk calculator</a>.

Fluoroscopy is used in interventional procedures (eg, cardiac catheterization, neuroangiography) and diagnostic exams (eg, gastrointestinal tract exam, retrograde urethrography). Nuclear medicine exams (eg, technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate bone scan, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [PET]) involve introducing a radioactive tracer into the body, which then emits gamma rays as it undergoes nuclear decay.</p><p>CT exams result in radiation doses that are 100 to 250 times larger than those from conventional plain radiographs and represent the fastest growing component of the United States population's collective dose. The radiation dose attributable to fluoroscopic procedures, including interventional cardiology procedures, is discussed elsewhere.

It is difficult to accurately estimate individual organ effective doses from a CT exam due to the unique physical characteristics of each patient, including their weight, age, and gender. Larger patients may require increased dose to penetrate additional body mass to generate adequate images, while younger patients will have more years of life left in which they may develop radiation-induced cancer. Moreover, since radiosensitivity differs by tissue type, the dose to a female's breasts or ovaries will differ from a male's dose to the testes even with the same magnitude of exposure.</p><p>A number of technical factors also influence radiation dose associated with CT, including the X-ray beam energy, tube current, tube voltage, exposure time, patient thickness, and scanning pitch (overlap of adjacent CT slices). Multiphasic CT exams, in which the same organ is scanned in different phases of contrast enhancement to improve lesion detection and characterization, can increase the radiation dose up to fourfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>To help develop a general estimate of effective dose for common CT exams, researchers developed standard patient models using Monte Carlo simulations that allow estimated organ doses to be combined with appropriate weighting factors. These standard patient models result in estimated effective doses for each type of exam for the average adult patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Software programs are available for gauging CT radiation dose after inputting certain technical parameters. Two estimations commonly used to quantify radiation dose, the volume CT dose index and the dose length product, are available on all modern CT scanners. These parameters cannot be directly converted into an estimate of effective dose but can gauge the difference in dose a patient will receive when altering specific technical scanning parameters (eg, pitch) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-related-risks-of-imaging/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The cumulative effect of small individual doses in a patient population undergoing frequent and often repeat imaging may present a new public health concern for risks such as radiation-induced malignancies. (See <a href=\"#H2016112\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At doses used in diagnostic and interventional procedures, ionizing radiation releases free radicals that may cause deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. Tissues are variably susceptible to radiation injury, based on their rate of cellular proliferation and their degree of cellular differentiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68401 \">table 1</a>). Radiation-induced cancers may develop decades after exposure and include myeloma, leukemia, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, bone cancer, and skin cancer.

Effective dose is measured in sieverts (Sv) or millisieverts (mSv) and allows comparison of exposure across different imaging modalities. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Annual effective dose is approximately 3 mSv from the natural background. Exposure to an individual dose of 50 mSv or a lifetime dose of 100 mSv has not been associated with increased health risks; as such, these have been adopted as guideline upper thresholds for diagnostic imaging in clinical practice. (See <a href=\"#H2016162\" class=\"local\">'Effective dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No epidemiologic studies document cancer arising directly from radiologic medical exams or procedures; risk estimates are based on extrapolations from individuals exposed to radiation following the 1945 atomic bombing in Japan. Estimating the risk of developing cancer from an individual radiologic exam is controversial, given the stochastic nature of harm from ionizing radiation and the limited epidemiologic data. However, it is possible that doses achieved with repeated diagnostic CT exams could reach levels associated with an increase in lifetime cancer risk.
