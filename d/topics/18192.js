TNF-alpha inhibitors offer a targeted strategy that contrasts with the nonspecific immunosuppressive agents traditionally used to treat most inflammatory diseases. However, multiple adverse effects of TNF-alpha inhibition have been identified through both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance.

However, these risks must be interpreted in the context of the potential benefits and of the adverse effects associated with conventional therapies for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases (eg, glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>), which are also significant and, in many cases, greater.</p><p>Thus, the decision to use an anti-TNF-alpha agent must be an individual one, based upon the specific clinical features and unique risk profile of a given patient.</p><p>As background to the overview of adverse events associated with TNF-alpha inhibition, we provide a brief review of TNF-alpha biology and the role of this cytokine in host defense.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">TNF-alpha biology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TNF-alpha is synthesized initially by activated macrophages and T cells as a transmembrane precursor protein. The cytoplasmic tail of this protein is then cleaved to release soluble TNF-alpha.</p><p>TNF-alpha, originally known as cachexin, was described in 1975 and recognized for its ability to lyse tumors in a variety of in vitro and mouse models (hence the name &quot;tumor necrosis factor&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-an-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The activity of TNF-alpha against tumors in laboratory models originally raised the possibility that inhibition of this cytokine might potentiate the clinical risk of malignancy. However, most subsequent longitudinal data suggest this is not the case.

Among 10,050 patients with RA of at least three years' duration who had a total of 12,066 patient-years of exposure to adalimumab, the event rate of HF was 0.26 per 100 patient-years. The HF event rate in 542 patients with less than three years of RA and 917 patient-years of exposure was 0.11 per 100 patient-years. A lower HF event rate (0.05 per 100 patient-years) was noted in an analysis of United States postmarketing safety of adalimumab with 55,384 patient-years of exposure from 2002 to 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-an-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Registry data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from a registry of patients with rheumatic disease suggested that RA is associated with an increased risk of HF, but that this risk might be attenuated by TNF inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-an-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. A two-year study of nearly 16,000 patients with either RA or osteoarthritis reported that HF was more common among patients with RA than those with osteoarthritis (3.9 versus 2.3 percent), even after adjustment for differences in baseline demographic characteristics. However, HF was less common among RA patients treated with TNF inhibitors (3.1 versus 3.8 percent), even after adjustments for baseline HF risk factors.</p><p>A subsequent study of 20,243 patients from four different healthcare benefit cohorts in the United States, which compared HF risk in new users of&nbsp;TNF inhibitors with new users of nonbiologic (synthetic) DMARDs (with similar baseline covariates), found no significant increase in the risk of either new or recurrent HF in the patients begun on a TNF inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-an-overview-of-adverse-effects/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Oral glucocorticoid use was associated with a dose-dependent increase in the risk of HF, which was seen in patients receiving at least 5 mg daily of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.19), but glucocorticoid use did not modify the risk with TNF inhibitors. Subgroup analysis found elevated risk in patients who initiated TNF inhibitor therapy before 2002 (HR 2.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 10.50, test for interaction p = 0.036). The reasons for the increased risk prior to 2002 are uncertain, but in October 2001 a warning was issued regarding HF and TNF inhibitors, and it is possible that patients thought by their treating clinicians to be at increased risk of heart failure were then disproportionately not treated with a TNF inhibitor, resulting subsequently in a lower rate of adverse events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TNF inhibitors have been used for the treatment of various lung diseases and for systemic inflammatory rheumatic disorders with or without pulmonary manifestations.
