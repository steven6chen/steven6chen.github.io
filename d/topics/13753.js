PCL can either originate de novo (primary PCL) or as a secondary leukemic transformation of multiple myeloma (secondary PCL).</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of plasma cell leukemia are discussed here. The related disorders of multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma are presented separately.

Historically, the majority of cases have been primary PCL (60 to 70 percent), although the incidence of secondary PCL may be increasing, perhaps due to the longer survival of myeloma patients, such that the distribution of disease is more evenly split [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]</p><p>The most extensive data on the epidemiology of PCL come from a series of 291 patients identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database between 1973 and 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. During this period, approximately 49,000 patients with multiple myeloma were identified, for a relative incidence of 0.6 percent. In this series there were no significant differences based upon gender, age, or race when compared with patients with multiple myeloma. This SEER study did not distinguish between primary and secondary PCL. </p><p>PCL occurs in all races and all geographic locations. The incidence of PCL in Europe is approximately 4 cases per 10,000,000 persons per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As with multiple myeloma, PCL is more common in African Americans and blacks from Africa than in whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Secondary PCL occurs as a progression of disease in 1 to 4 percent of all cases of multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. Primary PCL presents at a slightly younger age with median ages at diagnosis of 55 and 66 for patients with primary and secondary PCL, respectively. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presenting signs and symptoms can include those seen in multiple myeloma (eg, renal dysfunction, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, bone pain, anemia) and in other leukemias (eg, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, infections, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly). Approximately 40 percent of patients will have already been diagnosed with multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>As an example, a retrospective analysis reported the following clinical features in patients presenting with PCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median white blood cell count &ndash; 18.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median hemoglobin &ndash; 9.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median platelet count &ndash; 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">platelets/microL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteolytic lesions &ndash; 44 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extramedullary plasmacytoma &ndash; 14 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatomegaly &ndash; 21 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenomegaly &ndash; 13 percent</p><p/><p>Other findings that may be present on physical examination include lymphadenopathy, pulmonary findings related to pleural effusions, and neurological deficits due to central nervous system involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, laboratory evaluation frequently demonstrates elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and beta-2-microglobulin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral blood</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5211660\"><span class=\"h3\">Morphology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The peripheral blood smear of patients with plasma cell leukemia (PCL) demonstrates a leukocytosis with circulating plasma cells. The absolute plasma cell count typically exceeds <span class=\"nowrap\">2000/microL</span> or 20 percent of the peripheral white blood cell count. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The morphological features of plasma cells can differ depending upon their maturity and, at times, may be indistinguishable from myeloblasts. Mature plasma cells are oval with abundant basophilic cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63684\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63684 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76557\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76557 \">picture 2</a>). The nucleus is round and eccentrically located with a marked perinuclear hof, or cytoplasmic clearing. The nucleus contains &quot;clock-face&quot; or &quot;spoke wheel&quot; chromatin without nucleoli. Immature plasma cells have dispersed nuclear chromatin, prominent nucleoli and a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5211666\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunophenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry can be used to determine the immunophenotype of the neoplastic plasma cells revealing a malignant clone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The cytoplasm of the neoplastic plasma cells contains either kappa or lambda light chains, but not both, indicating that the cells are clonal. The neoplastic plasma cells typically express CD138 and CD38. If present, CD45 is of low intensity. CD19 or CD20 are usually absent. In contrast to most patients with multiple myeloma, the malignant cells in PCL frequently lack CD56 expression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5211672\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no single cytogenetic abnormality that is typical or diagnostic of PCL. Hypodiploid or diploid cells are present in more than 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most common abnormalities are deletion of chromosome 13 and monosomy 13. Deletion 17p, resulting in loss of TP53 has been detected in almost half of primary PCL and three-quarters of secondary PCL. In addition, PCL frequently has abnormalities in chromosome 1, in particular 1q21 amplification and del(1p21). </p><p>In one retrospective study, patients with PCL were noted to have the following high risk abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deletion of chromosome 13 by FISH in 67 to 85 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>t(4;14) in 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>t(14;16) in 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>del 17q13 in 50 to 75 percent</p><p/><p>This and other studies suggest that, when compared with multiple myeloma, PCL has a higher incidence of t(11;14), t(14;16), and monosomy 13, with a similar incidence of t(4;14). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The findings on bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are similar to those seen in multiple myeloma without plasma cell leukemia and demonstrate an increased number of monoclonal plasma cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61145\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61145 \">picture 3</a>). The bone marrow infiltration is usually extensive and consists of plasma cells with a high proliferative index and anaplastic or plasmablastic morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Bone marrow examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein electrophoresis and immunofixation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protein electrophoresis of the serum and an aliquot from a 24-hour urine collection usually demonstrates monoclonal immunoglobulin production (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67685\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67685 \">figure 1</a>).

Approximately 35 percent of patients will have light chain only disease and less than 10 percent will be non-secretors.

The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected plasma cell leukemia is identical to multiple myeloma, and should include a review of the peripheral blood smear, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) with immunofixation, protein electrophoresis of an aliquot from a 24-hour urine collection (UPEP), and peripheral blood plasma cell assessment by flow cytometry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of PCL is based upon an evaluation of the peripheral blood smear, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and protein electrophoresis. The diagnosis is confirmed when a monoclonal population of plasma cells is present in the peripheral blood with an absolute plasma cell count exceeding <span class=\"nowrap\">2000/microL</span> or 20 percent of the peripheral blood white cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. These cut-offs are arbitrary, and PCL should be considered whenever circulating plasma cells are readily detected on conventional complete blood count evaluation. Repeat testing will usually clarify the diagnosis. Significant involvement of the liver or pleural effusions with positive cytology for malignant plasma cells usually suggests plasma cell leukemia.</p><p>The cytoplasm of the neoplastic plasma cells must contain either kappa or lambda light chains, but not both, indicating that the cells are clonal.</p><p>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will demonstrate a monoclonal population of plasma cells. Monoclonal protein on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) or urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) supports, but is not necessary for making the diagnosis.</p><p>The criteria used to define PCL have not been validated prospectively and are under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The original diagnostic criteria required both an absolute plasma cell count exceeding <span class=\"nowrap\">2000/microL</span> and 20 percent of the peripheral blood white cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. However, many of the published case series required only one of these criteria for the diagnosis. There are concerns that these diagnostic criteria are not able to identify all patients with PCL. As an example, heavily pretreated patients may have a significant leukopenia at baseline that may prevent them from reaching the absolute plasma cell count criterion. In addition, the absolute number of plasma cells identified depends at least somewhat upon how aggressively the pathologist screens the peripheral blood smear to identify circulating plasma cells. As such, studies have been proposed to investigate if lower plasma cell levels (eg, 5 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> absolute peripheral blood plasma cell count &ge;0.5 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> have the same prognostic impact and whether flow cytometry should be used to provide a less subjective measure of disease burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of plasma cell leukemia (PCL) includes other leukemias and lymphomas with abnormal cells circulating in the peripheral blood. It also includes reactive polyclonal plasmacytosis that can be related to infectious or autoimmune disorders.</p><p>The majority of cases will be easily distinguished from other forms of leukemia and lymphoma by morphology with confirmation by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. Patients with multiple myeloma or other plasma cell dyscrasias are arbitrarily distinguished from plasma cell leukemia by lower numbers of circulating plasma cells, if present. A diagnosis of reactive polyclonal plasmacytosis can be excluded based upon absence of kappa or lambda light chain restriction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is poor; historically median survival was only 6 to 11 months, with up to 28 percent dying within the first month after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/1,3,10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,10,13</a>]. Survival was even shorter (two to seven months) when PCL (secondary) occurred in the context of refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While still suboptimal, overall survival has improved modestly with the widespread use of high dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (rescue) and the availability of novel agents. This was best illustrated in an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of 445 patients with primary PCL diagnosed between 1973 and 2009 which reported median overall survival times of 5, 6, 4, and 12 months for those patients diagnosed during 1973-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2005, and 2006-2009, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>It is likely that the reasons for poor outcome in PCL is related to a high proliferative rate and the fact that the malignant cells often harbor multiple cytogenetic abnormalities that are known to be associated with rapidly progressive, or high risk, multiple myeloma. In one retrospective study, patients with PCL were noted to have the following high risk abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deletion of chromosome 13 by FISH in 67 to 85 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>t(4;14) in 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>t(14;16) in 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>del 17q13 in 50 to 75 percent</p><p/><p>Genetic markers of high risk myeloma are discussed in more detail separately.

The physical examination should include a detailed neurologic exam.</p><p>Our pretreatment evaluation also includes the following studies, some of which are performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete blood count and differential with examination of the peripheral blood smear.

Recommendations are primarily based upon data from small retrospective series, case reports, and extrapolation of data from patients with multiple myeloma.

Responding patients underwent high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> plus autologous HCT followed by either a second autologous HCT and maintenance therapy or a reduced intensity allogeneic HCT.

Median progression-free and overall survivals were 15 and 36 months, respectively. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter retrospective study of 73 patients with PCL included 14 patients initially treated with a regimen that contained <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Among patients initially treated with bortezomib, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, or a combination of the two drugs, the median survival was 12.6 months, but among patients responding to bortezomib, approximately half were alive without relapse at 26 months from diagnosis.

The role of HCT in PCL is less clear. Prospective randomized trials of HCT have not included patients with PCL. Case reports and case series have recorded some long term responses to autologous or allogeneic HCT in PCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/7,20,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20,35-38</a>]. However, most of these data are based upon patients who were treated with non-bortezomib-based induction regimens.</p><p>Due to the poor prognosis with chemotherapy alone in these patients, we offer high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue to eligible patients with PCL. This approach follows bortezomib-based induction therapy as discussed above. Following HCT, consideration should be given to some form of maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Induction therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>The following is a compilation of reports on the use of HCT in PCL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest retrospective study was conducted by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and included 272 patients with primary PCL and 20,844 patients with multiple myeloma who had undergone autologous HCT from 1980 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. While patients with PCL were more likely to enter complete remission after transplantation, their median progression-free survival (14 versus 27 months) and overall survival (26 versus 62 months) were inferior to that of patients with multiple myeloma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research analyzed the outcomes of patients with PCL who underwent autologous (97 patients, median age 56 years) or allogeneic (50 patients, median age 48 years) HCT within 18 months of diagnosis between 1995 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Following autologous HCT, estimated rates of progression-free survival, relapse, non-relapse mortality, and overall survival at three years were 34, 61, 5, and 64 percent, respectively. Corresponding rates following allogeneic HCT were 20, 38, 41, and 39 percent, respectively, indicating inferior outcome with allogeneic compared with autologous transplantation in this patient population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter retrospective analysis of 73 patients with primary PCL included 23 patients who had undergone a single autologous HCT (nine patients), a double autologous HCT (eight patients), an allogeneic HCT (two patients) or a tandem <span class=\"nowrap\">autologous/allogeneic</span> HCT (four patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among patients who underwent HCT, the median overall survival and duration of response were 38 and 27 months, respectively. In this highly selected group, patients who survived initial therapy and received HCT had superior survival and response durations when compared with those who did not receive HCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a phase II trial of 40 patients with PCL treated with bortezomib-based induction, responding patients underwent autologous HCT followed by either a second autologous HCT (6 patients) or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT (16 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/plasma-cell-leukemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. For the entire cohort, median progression-free and overall survivals were 15 and 36 months, respectively. The median overall survival was not reached for those undergoing autologous HCT and was 36 months for those undergoing allogeneic HCT. Part of this survival benefit may reflect selection bias with younger patients who survived initial therapy proceeding to HCT.</p><p/><p>At present, the data above suggest that HCT may be of value in PCL, although no definite conclusions can be made due to lack of randomized data. Further, there are no data on whether allogeneic approaches offer any additional benefit compared with autologous HCT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16113105\"><span class=\"h3\">Maintenance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance therapy refers to the prolonged administration of agents with low toxicity profiles in an attempt to prevent progression of disease. There have been no randomized studies of maintenance therapy in patients with PCL. However, since virtually all patients with PCL who attain a complete remission develop relapsed disease, consideration should be given to some form of maintenance therapy. Maintenance therapy can prolong progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with multiple myeloma. The benefits of improved PFS must be balanced against an increased rate of severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> neutropenia, risk of second cancers and other toxicities, the cost, and the possibility that the PFS advantage may be neutralized by the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> at time of first relapse.</p><p>However, given the short remission durations (14 months) seen in these patients and the relatively mild toxicity of maintenance, we suggest the use of maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> rather than observation until relapse. Studies evaluating the use of maintenance therapy after autologous transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Standard-risk disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16113495\"><span class=\"h2\">Response assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be evaluated before each treatment cycle to determine how their disease is responding to therapy.

This assessment includes the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitation of peripheral blood plasma cells by morphologic review of the peripheral smear</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of monoclonal (M) protein in the serum and urine (SPEP, UPEP)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of previously identified or suspected extramedullary disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow evaluation is incorporated to identify very good partial response or better. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The free light chain (FLC) assay and flow cytometry of the peripheral blood are incorporated to identify stringent complete remission.</p><p/><p>The goal of therapy in PCL is to achieve and maintain a complete response, as much as possible; this goal therefore influences the choice of the initial treatment options. However, since the disease is not considered curable, failure to achieve a complete response should not be construed as a reason to change or intensify therapy. There are no data that such an approach leads to superior survival. In selected patients with good performance status who fail to achieve complete response, after a full discussion of the pros and cons, consideration can be given to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and other options used for patients with relapsed refractory disease.

PCL can either originate de novo (primary PCL) or as a secondary leukemic transformation of multiple myeloma (secondary PCL). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presenting signs and symptoms can include those seen in multiple myeloma (eg, renal dysfunction, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, anemia) and in other leukemias (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia, infections, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected plasma cell leukemia is identical to multiple myeloma and should include a review of the peripheral blood smear, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) with immunofixation, and protein electrophoresis of an aliquot from a 24-hour urine collection (UPEP). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is made when a monoclonal population of plasma cells is present in the peripheral blood typically with an absolute plasma cell count exceeding <span class=\"nowrap\">2000/microL</span> or 20 percent of the peripheral blood white cells.

Survival is even shorter (two to seven months) when PCL occurs in the context of refractory or relapsing multiple myeloma. Survival may have improved with incorporation of new agents into the treatment strategy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There have been no prospective randomized trials investigating the treatment of PCL.
