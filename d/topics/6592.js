A number of general principles apply to both vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. These are outlined below and in a 2014 guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency from the British Committee for Standards in Haematology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43880774\"><span class=\"h2\">Urgency of correction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most individuals with vitamin B12 or folate deficiency present asymptomatically with an incidental laboratory finding or with the slow development of symptoms.

Rare cases of hypersensitivity or acneiform eruptions with vitamin B12 have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]; we have not seen these in our practice. Reports of serious adverse effects from administration or intake of greater-than-recommended doses have not been observed. However, it is possible that toxicity may occur if these vitamins are administered at thousands of times the recommended daily allowance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention#H74132982\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin supplementation in disease prevention&quot;, section on 'Toxicity at high doses'</a>.)</p><p>Despite the lack of adverse effects, we do not advocate routine administration of vitamin B12 or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplements to groups of individuals without documented deficiency. This practice is likely to incur excess costs and burdens and could potentially mask underlying disorders. An exception is women who may become pregnant, for whom routine folic acid supplementation is used to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Certain populations are treated with routine supplementation due to their high risk of deficiency.

However, certain settings are associated with an increased risk of deficiency:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vegan or vegetarian diet</strong> &ndash; Vitamin B12 is present in many animal-based foods but not in plant-derived foods. Some vitamin B12 may be ingested from soil present on plants or from milk or eggs. However, individuals who consume a vegan or strict vegetarian diet generally should take supplemental vitamin B12 to ensure adequate stores. This is especially important in women who are pregnant or may become pregnant since the developing fetus also requires adequate vitamin B12. Other nonvegetarian diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, may not contain sufficient vitamin B12 in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Daily requirements and recommended intake are discussed in more detail separately.

Supplementation can be provided by many routes, as listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F114101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114101 \">table 1</a>) and discussed separately.

Typically, individuals with these conditions are monitored periodically for vitamin B12 deficiency rather than given routine supplementation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency#H2652234191\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency&quot;, section on 'Vitamin B12 level (serum)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neonates born to vitamin B12-deficient mothers</strong> &ndash; Infants born to mothers with vitamin B12 deficiency are at risk for being born deficient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> of becoming deficient if exclusively breastfed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. The best means of preventing neonatal deficiency is to ensure that the mother is vitamin B12 replete during the pregnancy and breastfeeding. If the neonate is discovered to be vitamin B12-deficient at birth, rapid correction is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children#H24346287\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acquired peripheral neuropathies in children&quot;, section on 'Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrous oxide</a><strong> exposure</strong> &ndash; Individuals with prolonged or high-dose exposure to nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) gas, either as an inhalant anesthetic or as a drug of abuse, can develop rapid onset of vitamin B12 deficiency, especially if their baseline levels of vitamin B12 are borderline. This occurs because N<sub>2</sub>O chemically inactivates the vitamin B12-derived methylcobalamin molecule at the active site of methionine synthase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This can lead to rapid neuropsychiatric deterioration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other complications. We obtain a complete blood count in individuals with known vitamin B12 or folate deficiency preoperatively and postoperatively and evaluate macrocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anemia as rapidly as is feasible to avoid this complication.

(See <a href=\"#H2271800727\" class=\"local\">'Route of administration'</a> above.)</p><p>Aging is not always associated with an increased risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. However, some older individuals may be near the threshold for deficiency and may be at increased risk if they have gastric dysfunction or regularly use antihistamines or proton pump inhibitors, which reduce gastric acid needed for optimal vitamin B12 absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Additional discussion of pathophysiology and other less common conditions that predispose to vitamin B12 deficiency are discussed separately.

The following describe common approaches to deciding among these in patients with different causes of deficiency:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pernicious anemia</strong> &ndash; Pernicious anemia (PA; vitamin B12 deficiency due to autoantibodies that inhibit vitamin B12 absorption) is a potentially lifelong condition that prevents vitamin B12 absorption and thus is usually treated with parenteral vitamin B12. Typically this is administered parenterally (by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection), at a dose of 1000 mcg (1 mg) once per week for four weeks, followed by 1000 mcg once per month. These doses have been found to be effective in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Therapy is continued indefinitely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Altered gastrointestinal anatomy</strong> &ndash; Alterations in gastrointestinal anatomy that affect production of intrinsic factor or absorption of the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex include bariatric surgery, gastrectomy, ileal loop syndrome, and others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the alteration is permanent, then indefinite treatment with parenteral vitamin B12 is usually appropriate. If the alteration is reversed, then therapy may be discontinued, although it is reasonable to check the vitamin B12 level several months after stopping therapy. We often check the level three or four times during the first year off of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3390363380\" class=\"local\">'Intensity of and duration of monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dietary deficiency</strong> &ndash; Individuals with diets that lack vitamin B12 (eg, vegans, vegetarians, infants exclusively breastfed by vitamin B12-deficient mothers) are expected to have normal absorption via the oral route and can be treated with oral supplements that provide the recommended amount. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention#H45\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin supplementation in disease prevention&quot;, section on 'Vitamin B12 (cobalamin)'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The typical dose for children is 50 to 100 mcg parenterally once per week until the deficiency is corrected and then once per month (cyanocobalamin) or once every other month (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxocobalamin-vitamin-b12a-supplement-and-cyanide-antidote-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxocobalamin</a>); oral doses in children are not well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The typical dose for adults is 1000 mcg parenterally once per week until the deficiency is corrected and then once per month (cyanocobalamin) or once every other month (hydroxocobalamin); in adults, oral dosing is equally effective, at a dose of 1000 mcg orally once per day.</p><p>The following may also influence the decision to use parenteral versus oral administration:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Concerning symptoms</strong> &ndash; Some individuals with symptomatic anemia, neurologic or neuropsychiatric findings, or pregnancy (in which the developing fetus may be deprived of vitamin B12) may benefit from more aggressive repletion. For these symptomatic patients or those with greater urgency for correction, we suggest initial administration of parenteral vitamin B12 since this ensures rapid absorption and compliance. However, data are limited as to whether correction of the deficiency occurs more rapidly or long-term complications are reduced with parenteral versus oral therapy, as discussed below. These individuals may be treated with 1000 mcg of vitamin B12 every other day initially for approximately two weeks, followed by administration once monthly (cyanocobalamin) or once every two to three months (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxocobalamin-vitamin-b12a-supplement-and-cyanide-antidote-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxocobalamin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Once the initial deficiency has been corrected, it would be reasonable to switch to oral administration if the patient preferred the oral route, as long as individuals with impaired absorption are given high enough doses to ensure adequate serum levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lack of access to parenteral administration or patient preference</strong> &ndash; Some individuals may not have access to parenteral vitamin B12, particularly those residing in resource-limited settings, and some individuals may prefer to use an oral, sublingual, or intranasal vitamin B12 preparation. In these cases, it is reasonable to use the formulation that is available or that the patient prefers, as long as the dose is appropriate. Sublingual vitamin B12 replacement has not been studied extensively, but data from small studies suggest that therapy is effective as long as the dose is sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/2,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16,17</a>]. We often check vitamin B12 levels three to four times during the first year of therapy. Some experts will give the initial dose parenterally to ensure absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Possible issues with medication adherence</strong> &ndash; Some individuals may have more difficulty adhering to daily oral medication. In these cases, parenteral therapy, especially monthly vitamin B12 injections, ensures adequate adherence with relatively low costs and burdens.</p><p/><p>For individuals with impaired absorption of vitamin B12, therapy with very high oral doses of oral vitamin B12 (eg, 1000 to 2000 mcg daily) will be effective as long as the dose is high enough to provide absorption via a mechanism that does not require intrinsic factor or a functioning terminal ileum (ie, passive <span class=\"nowrap\">diffusion/mass</span> action) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/12,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18-20</a>].</p><p>Evidence regarding the relative efficacy of parenteral versus high-dose oral vitamin B12 comes from small randomized trials and observational studies. A 2006 systematic review found data from two randomized trials (108 participants) that compared oral versus intramuscular vitamin B12 and found that oral vitamin B12 at these doses was equivalent to or better than intramuscular vitamin B12 for raising serum vitamin B12 levels, correcting anemia, and in one case resolving neuropsychiatric findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies/abstract/13,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21,22</a>].

There are several available formulations and possible routes of administration. The choice among these, as well as other considerations (duration of therapy, additional testing) depend on the underlying cause of the deficiency and urgency with which it needs to be corrected.

For patients with vitamin B12 deficiency who have concerning symptoms (eg, severe or symptomatic anemia, neuropsychiatric findings), we suggest parenteral rather than oral vitamin B12 (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This ensures rapid absorption and compliance, although improvements in anemia and neuropsychiatric findings may be equivalent with oral administration. The dose is 1000 mcg by deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injection once weekly for one month followed by 1000 mcg once per month. Oral (or sublingual) vitamin B12 are effective alternatives if compliance is not a concern. If oral vitamin B12 is used in individuals with impaired absorption, the dose is 1000 to 2000 mcg daily. Pernicious anemia and other chronic causes of deficiency are treated indefinitely.
