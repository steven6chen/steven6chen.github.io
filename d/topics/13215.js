Beginning in adolescence, the rate of comorbid substance abuse progressively increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-comorbidity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], such that substance use disorders occur more often in youth with bipolar disorder than in healthy controls and youth with other psychiatric disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-comorbidity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

A prospective observational study found that among adolescents with bipolar disorder who do not have a comorbid substance use disorder when they first present (n = 167), experimentation with alcohol at the start of the study was the single strongest predictor of later substance abuse, although experimentation with cannabis also predicted later substance abuse. Other risk factors for developing a substance use disorder include greater severity of <span class=\"nowrap\">hypomanic/manic</span> symptoms; poor family functioning; lifetime history of alcohol use (experimentation), panic disorder, or oppositional defiant disorder; and family history of substance use disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-comorbidity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Among teens with three or more risk factors, 54.7 percent went on to develop substance abuse, compared with 14.1 percent of teens with zero to two risk factors. This study suggest that there may be a window of two to three years during which clinicians can attempt to prevent substance abuse in these youth by targeting these risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3648302725\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other less common comorbid disorders observed in pediatric bipolar disorder include autism spectrum disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-comorbidity/abstract/9,15,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,28-31</a>].

The mechanism appears to involve multiple systemic processes, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and autonomic dysfunction. Several traditional cardiovascular risk factors (eg, diabetes mellitus, sedentary lifestyle, and tobacco smoking) are more prevalent among adolescents with bipolar disorder compared with the general pediatric population. Although psychotropic medication may contribute to the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, it appears that the association between bipolar disorder and cardiovascular disease is independent of medication effects. Based upon available data, the American Heart Association proposed in a 2015 statement that bipolar disorder be positioned alongside other pediatric diseases (chronic inflammatory disease, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, Kawasaki disease, and nephrotic syndrome) that are considered moderate risk conditions for early cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-comorbidity/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Comorbidities may adversely affect response to treatment of bipolar disorder and the course of illness. The prevalence of common comorbidities is approximately as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anxiety disorders &ndash; 40 to 66 percent of youth with bipolar disorder</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder &ndash; 50 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Disruptive behavior disorders &ndash; 40 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Conduct disorder &ndash; 30 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Substance use disorder &ndash; 20 to 30 percent</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"#H1736961242\" class=\"local\">'Psychiatric comorbidity'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Youth with bipolar disorder appear to be at increased risk of comorbid general medical disorders, particularly cardiometabolic conditions. Comorbid chronic medical conditions may occur in approximately 75 percent bipolar patients, and roughly 25 to 33 percent of bipolar patients have multiple medical comorbidities (See <a href=\"#H2857380089\" class=\"local\">'General medical comorbidity'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Birmaher B, Axelson D, Pavaluri M.
