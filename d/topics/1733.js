Despite advances in infant intensive care, neonatal meningitis remains a devastating disease with considerable risk of mortality and morbidity.</p><p>The neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis in the neonate will be discussed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of bacterial meningitis in neonates are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in the neonate: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-treatment-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in the neonate: Treatment and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute complications of neonatal bacterial meningitis include cerebral edema (vasogenic and cytotoxic), increased intracranial pressure, ventriculitis, cerebritis, hydrocephalus, brain abscess, cerebral infarction, cerebral venous thrombosis, arterial stroke, and subdural effusion or empyema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Development of these complications may necessitate additional evaluation, neurosurgical consultation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lengthened duration of antimicrobial therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventriculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventriculitis refers to inflammation of the ventricular fluid and lining of the ventricles and is sometimes associated with obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid flow. Ventriculitis is a common complication of neonatal meningitis, occurring in up to 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. It is diagnosed by neuroimaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventricular tap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>There are no reliable clinical signs of ventriculitis, although evidence of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) usually is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It must be suspected on the basis of failure to respond clinically and bacteriologically to appropriate antimicrobial therapy; if ventriculitis results in obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, the access of systemic antibiotics to the ventricular CSF can be limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-treatment-and-outcome#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in the neonate: Treatment and outcome&quot;, section on 'Monitoring response to therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Neuroimaging should be performed to make the diagnosis. Cranial sonography can demonstrate findings suggestive of ventriculitis or obstructed flow of CSF (intraventricular strands attached to ventricular surface, echogenic ependyma, dilated ventricles) and can be performed at the bedside [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. While contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate enhancement of the lining of the ventricles, these imaging modalities are usually not necessary for initial management.</p><p>Ventricular fluid aspiration is indicated for infants who have ventriculitis with an obstruction to the flow of CSF. In this setting, cultures of CSF often remain positive for the infecting organism for several days or longer.</p><p>The management of infants with ventriculitis is best undertaken in consultation with specialists in pediatric infectious diseases and pediatric neurosurgery. Treatment can involve direct instillation of an antimicrobial into the ventricle. Uncommonly, the duration of antimicrobial therapy may extend several weeks longer than the time required to sterilize the ventricular CSF and can be as long as six to eight weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hydrocephalus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydrocephalus occurs in approximately 25 percent of infants with neonatal meningitis overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] and 30 to 44 percent of cases of gram-negative neonatal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. Hydrocephalus is more common in meningitis caused by group B streptococcus (GBS) type III than by other types of GBS, and in K1 <em>Escherichia coli</em> meningitis than in non-K1 <em>E. coli</em> meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Clinical findings of hydrocephalus include signs of increased intracranial pressure (bradycardia, hypertension, respiratory depression) and accelerated head growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, these are late findings; significant dilatation of the ventricles can occur before head growth becomes abnormal.</p><p>Diagnosis is made with neuroimaging. In the neonate, cranial sonography is the preferred technique for the initial examination because it is portable and avoids ionizing radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anesthesia. Limited imaging using ultrafast MRI also does not typically require sedation and is increasingly used as an alternative to ultrasonography in the evaluation of hydrocephalus in infants. The evaluation and management of hydrocephalus are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocephalus-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydrocephalus in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydrocephalus in children: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain abscess occurs in approximately 10 percent of patients with neonatal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and in 11 to 19 percent of patients with gram-negative neonatal bacterial meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. The risk of brain abscess is increased in neonates with meningitis caused by <em>Citrobacter koseri</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>], <em>Serratia marcescens </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], <em>Proteus mirabilis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16</a>], and <em>Cronobacter sakazakii</em> (formerly known as <em>Enterobacter</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Brain abscess is a rare complication of neonatal meningitis caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Findings consistent with brain abscess(es) typically develop in the second week of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The findings can be subtle and include vomiting, bulging fontanelle, increased head circumference, separation of the cranial sutures, hemiparesis, focal seizures, and increased peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/2,3,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,20</a>]. Development of a brain abscess should be suspected in neonates with new-onset seizures, prominent focal cerebral signs, or poor clinical response to antibiotic therapy. Marked clinical deterioration can occur if an abscess ruptures into the lateral ventricle or subarachnoid space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21</a>].</p><p>Findings on repeat lumbar puncture (LP) can include CSF pleocytosis of up to a few hundred cells, with a predominance of mononuclear cells, and elevated protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. If the abscess has ruptured into the lateral ventricle or subarachnoid space, the CSF WBC count and protein can be increased, and the CSF glucose can be decreased compared with those at the time of initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>If brain abscess is suspected, neuroimaging should be performed with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. Characteristic cranial CT or MRI findings of brain abscess include a variably circumscribed region of decreased attenuation and contrast enhancement of the rim [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The area of decreased attenuation is often of greater extent than the abscess itself because of the presence of cerebritis with surrounding edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-treatment-and-outcome#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in the neonate: Treatment and outcome&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.)</p><p>A pediatric neurosurgeon should be consulted regarding the need for surgical intervention (needle aspiration or excision). Serial brain imaging at weekly or biweekly intervals should be performed to monitor the evolution of the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The duration of antibiotic therapy may need to be extended to six to eight weeks depending on the clinical and radiographic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The minimum duration of treatment for brain abscess complicating GBS meningitis is 21 days, and for brain abscess complicating gram-negative meningitis is 21 days or at least 14 days after sterilization of CSF is achieved.</p><p>The development of a brain abscess is associated with poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In one series of 30 cases of neonatal brain abscess (20 were associated with meningitis, 27 were caused by <em>Proteus </em>species), there were four deaths (three from the initial illness and one from a shunt complication) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among the 27 who survived the acute illness, 16 had seizures. Among the 17 survivors who were followed until two years of age, 13 (76 percent) had an intelligence quotient (IQ) or developmental quotient (DQ) less than 80.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal meningitis can be complicated by severe cerebrovascular disease, including arterial ischemic stroke and cerebral sinovenous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,23</a>]. Autopsy studies indicate that infarction occurs in 30 to 50 percent of cases of fatal neonatal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. When infarction develops, it tends to occur early in the disease process, most commonly within the first week after the diagnosis of meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/8,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26</a>]. Clinical manifestations may include focal seizures and hemiparesis. Thromboses more often arise in small than in major vessels and involve veins more often than arteries. Two distinct patterns of focal infarction have been identified in neonates with group B streptococcal meningitis, a deep perforator arterial stroke to the basal ganglia, thalamus, and periventricular white matter and a superficial injury with patchy, focal infarctions of the cortical surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stroke in the newborn: Classification, manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Subdural effusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subdural effusion occurs in approximately 11 percent of neonates with bacterial meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and 7 to 13 percent of those with gram-negative meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. However, clinically significant subdural effusion is uncommon in neonates with bacterial meningitis, and subdural empyema is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Clinical findings of subdural effusion are often subtle or absent. They can include a full or bulging fontanelle, accelerated head growth, or signs of increased ICP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>].</p><p>Most subdural effusions resolve spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27,28</a>]. Indications for aspiration can include suspicion that the fluid is infected (eg, subdural empyema), imminent development of craniocerebral disproportion, focal neurologic findings, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of increased ICP if the findings appear to be related to the effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>].
