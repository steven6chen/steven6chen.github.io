The increased severity of influenza in pregnant women is thought to be related to normal physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy. For example, heart rate and oxygen consumption increase, lung capacity decreases, and there is a shift away from cell-mediated immunity.</p><p>Because of the increased severity of influenza in pregnancy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> is recommended for pregnant women, regardless of trimester of pregnancy. In addition, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed influenza should receive prompt empiric treatment with an appropriate antiviral medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1511340378\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of influenza in pregnant women are similar to those in the general population, and include fever, cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, headache, shortness of breath, and myalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The excess risk may be limited to women infected in the third trimester and the first four weeks postpartum; however, available data are of low quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The clinical course of influenza in pregnancy has become difficult to study because pregnant women are encouraged to be immunized against influenza and, if symptomatic, they are likely to be identified early and treated empirically with antiviral medications. The clinical course of influenza in pregnant women is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the 1918 to 1919 and 1957 to 1958 pandemics, pregnant women had high mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, pregnant women had increased rates of hospitalization for acute respiratory disease during influenza season compared with nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a disproportionate number of deaths occurred among pregnant women, who accounted for 5 percent of all deaths even though they comprised only 1 percent of the United States general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Twelve percent of pregnancy-related deaths were attributed to confirmed or possible H1N1 infection during this pandemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].&nbsp;Pregnant women had a more severe course once infected, but there was no evidence that they were more susceptible to infection with 2009 H1N1 influenza virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cumulative data including and subsequent to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic show that pregnant women with influenza are more likely to be hospitalized and to be admitted to an intensive care unit compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. Severe illness (defined as admission to an intensive care unit or death) is seen more often among women in whom treatment with antiviral medications is delayed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5795638\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fetal effects of influenza have not been well-studied. Transplacental transmission of influenza virus appears to be rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], but has been documented in a case of fatal avian influenza (H5N1) in a pregnant woman [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, maternal influenza during pregnancy might have adverse effects on the fetus even in the absence of transplacental transmission.</p><p>In a 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, influenza or influenza-like illness in the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of congenital abnormalities (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for any anomaly 2.00, 95% CI 1.62-2.48), including cleft lip (OR 3.2), neural tube defects (OR 3.3), hydrocephaly (OR 5.7), and congenital heart defects (OR 1.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Hyperthermia (including fever) is a common clinical manifestation of influenza and a risk factor for certain birth defects and other adverse infant outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This risk appears to be attenuated by use of antipyretics. (See <a href=\"#H5795726\" class=\"local\">'Antipyretics'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management#H2793547954\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management&quot;, section on 'Fever/hyperthermia'</a>.)</p><p>There are also reports that maternal influenza infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, low birth weight, birth of a small for gestational age infant, and fetal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/2,6,17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,17-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5795652\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5795661\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccination</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1511341420\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since 2004, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended that all women who are pregnant or will be pregnant during influenza season receive any licensed, age-appropriate, recommended influenza vaccine, regardless of trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged &ge;6 months who do not have contraindications, including pregnant and postpartum women. Both a quadrivalent vaccine (containing two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses) and a trivalent inactivated vaccine (containing two influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus) are available. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices does not preferentially recommend a specific formulation of influenza vaccine, trivalent or quadrivalent, as comparative effectiveness data in large populations are not available to support a specific recommendation. An egg-free recombinant vaccine, available for adults between the ages of 18 and 49 years who are allergic to eggs, may be used in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p><strong>Pregnant women should not receive a live-attenuated influenza vaccine </strong>due to concerns about the safety of a live vaccine administered during pregnancy. Although live-attenuated influenza vaccine is available as an intranasal spray, it is not recommended for use in any population in the United States during the 2017 to 2018 season due to concerns about its effectiveness. Recommendations may differ in other countries. Pregnant and postpartum women do not need to avoid contact with individuals who recently received the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-live-attenuated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">live attenuated influenza vaccine</a> and it is safe for use postpartum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-during-pregnancy#H262421234\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Live vaccines'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults&quot;, section on 'Live attenuated vaccine'</a>.)</p><p>Despite these recommendations, which are supported and promoted by key professional groups such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], coverage rates have remained low for many years. In response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and broad educational efforts to target pregnant women and their providers, national estimates of influenza coverage rates for pregnant women in the United States have increased to approximately 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, as of early November 2017, influenza vaccination coverage was only about 36 percent among pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Rates of influenza vaccination during pregnancy are higher in women whose providers specifically recommend it, and highest when the provider both recommends and offers the vaccine. These findings highlight the importance of provider involvement to increase influenza vaccination of pregnant women. Healthcare providers may find the healthcare provider script developed by ACOG helpful for talking with women about the importance of influenza vaccination for pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1511341276\"><span class=\"h3\">Benefits</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1920050469\"><span class=\"h4\">Reduction in maternal influenza illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Influenza vaccination plays a key role in reducing the risk of maternal influenza illness. Multiple clinical studies and surveillance data have demonstrated the benefits of influenza vaccination for pregnant women, including those with human immunodeficiency virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Pregnant women achieve seroprotection at rates similar to nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/22,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,30</a>], although there may be some differences in the antibody response of pregnant women to influenza vaccine compared with nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of vaccination for preventing influenza in healthy adults, H1N1 vaccines reduced the risk of influenza-like illness in pregnant women by 89 percent (95% CI 79-94) and the seasonal vaccine reduced the risk of influenza-like illness in pregnant women by 24 percent (95% CI 11-35) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Newborns of vaccinated women had a 41 percent (95% CI 6-63) reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza. The systematic review did not include a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] or a large case-control study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]; the latter was published just prior to the review. In a large trial in which pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> or pneumococcal vaccine, those who received the influenza vaccine had a 36 percent (95% CI 4-57) reduction in febrile respiratory illness and their infants had a 63 percent (95% CI 5-85) reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In the large case-control study, influenza vaccination reduced the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza by about one-half [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2891290893\"><span class=\"h4\">Improvement in pregnancy outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies on the effect of maternal influenza immunization on stillbirth and miscarriage, influenza vaccination was associated with a reduction in risk of stillbirth (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.96) but had no significant effect on risk of miscarriage (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.68-1.22) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Others have reported influenza vaccination is associated with a reduced risk for small for gestational age infants and preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/33,36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36-40</a>] and an increase in birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29235698\"><span class=\"h4\">Infant protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to protecting the pregnant woman, influenza vaccination during pregnancy protects the infant for several months after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/29,33,41-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33,41-47</a>]. Antenatal maternal immunization induces substantial levels of anti-influenza-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), which are actively transferred across the placenta to the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], and anti-influenza-specific IgA in breast milk, which is transferred to the infant during lactation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Thus, antenatal maternal vaccination is an effective strategy for reducing influenza-related morbidity and mortality among infants, who are at increased risk for severe influenza illness and not eligible for vaccination until six months of age because they fail to mount an adequate immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Maternal vaccine may also reduce hospitalizations for all-cause acute lower respiratory tract infection before three months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>However, passive protection afforded by maternal influenza vaccination appears to decline&nbsp;significantly before the infant is eligible for vaccination. In a randomized trial of 1026 infants of women who received trivalent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> during pregnancy and 1023 infants of women who received a placebo, the vaccine's efficacy against polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed influenza illness was about 86 percent in infants &le;8 weeks of age and 25 to 30 percent in infants 8 to 24 weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The percentage of infants with hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers &ge;1:40 to the influenza vaccine strains targeted by the vaccine was &ge;56 percent in the first week and fell to &lt;10 percent at 24 weeks of age. Others have observed similar decreases in vaccine efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>It is possible that maternal immunization in the third trimester would improve passive protection for the newborn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], as with Tdap; however, delaying maternal immunization places the mother at risk for influenza and its sequelae (maternal and fetal) and is not recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4917167\"><span class=\"h3\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although pregnant women often have concerns about the safety of vaccines for their fetuses, multiple studies have not shown an increased risk of complications associated with administration of inactivated influenza vaccines to pregnant women compared with the general population. Although rare, all vaccines, including influenza vaccine, have some background risk of adverse effects, such as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Vaccination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard immunizations for nonpregnant adults&quot;, section on 'Safety'</a>). However, no specific concerns for pregnant women, their fetuses, infants, or school-age children have been identified from multiple research studies and monitoring systems worldwide that have collected information on the safety of all types of influenza vaccination (eg, monovalent H1N1, seasonal trivalent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/22,32,33,55-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32,33,55-66</a>]. However, data are limited regarding first trimester administration and use of quadrivalent and cell-culture based vaccines, and even more limited for recombinant influenza vaccines. One exception is a case-control study of a possible association between spontaneous abortion and vaccination with a pH1N1-containing vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. A significant association was found only in the subgroup of women who received two consecutive pH1N1-containing vaccines during 2010 to 2011 and 2011 to 2012 seasons. This study had several limitations and the finding needs to be confirmed before considering any change in recommendations for influenza vaccination in pregnancy. </p><p>Although influenza vaccines that contain adjuvants (substances that boost the immune response and potentially provide longer-lasting and broader protection against antigenically-drifted viruses) are only approved in the United States for use in individuals &ge;65 years of age, experience from Europe provides limited but reassuring data on the safety of adjuvant-containing influenza vaccines administered to pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>].</p><p>There is no evidence that vaccines that contain thimerosal are harmful to the children of women who received thimerosal-containing vaccines during pregnancy. However, thimerosal-free formulations of the seasonal influenza vaccine are available.

Antiviral prophylaxis is a reasonable option for pregnant women and postpartum women with significant exposures up to two weeks after delivery (including those who have had pregnancy loss), as well as other high-risk groups. Early treatment, once signs or symptoms of influenza develop, is an alternative to prophylaxis.

When scheduling appointments and at office check-in, patients and the persons who accompany them can be instructed to inform office staff if they have symptoms of a respiratory infection. Symptomatic individuals should be given facemasks and supplies and instructions for hand hygiene. They should wait in a separate waiting area or be asked to sit as far away from others as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5795682\"><span class=\"h3\">Healthy term newborns of symptomatic mothers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Healthy term newborns of mothers with confirmed or suspected influenza infection should be considered exposed, not infected, if they are born in the hospital using the recommended infection control guidelines. Asymptomatic healthy term newborns can be cared for in the well-born nursery using Standard Precautions and should be observed for signs of infection.</p><p>Given the risk of severe complications of influenza in newborns, the CDC recommends considering temporary separation of a mother with suspected or confirmed influenza from her newborn. The length of temporary separation needs to be made on a case-by-case basis. Although there are no data on which to formulate evidence-based recommendations about the length of separation, CDC guidelines developed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic may provide a reasonable approach. These guidelines recommended separating a mother with 2009 H1N1 from her infant until three criteria were met: The mother had received antiviral medications for 48 hours, was afebrile without antipyretics for &gt;24 hours, and was able to control her cough and respiratory secretions. During temporary separation, all feedings should be provided by a healthy caregiver. Mothers who intend to breastfeed should be encouraged to express their milk. (See <a href=\"#H5795689\" class=\"local\">'Breastfeeding'</a> below.)</p><p>If temporary separation is not feasible or acceptable, then environmental controls should be considered, such as physical barriers and keeping the newborn &gt;6 feet away from the ill mother.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576399033\"><span class=\"h3\">Infant caregivers and household contacts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All individuals who live with, or provide care for, infants younger than 6 months of age should be vaccinated against influenza. Ideally, caregivers and household contacts should be vaccinated before the infant is discharged home from the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Otherwise, those who are unvaccinated and eligible for vaccination (ie, &gt;6 months of age) should be strongly encouraged to be vaccinated in a timely way.

Since the influenza vaccine is not 100 percent effective and infection after vaccination has been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], pregnant women with suspected influenza infection should be treated promptly regardless of vaccination status.

Available data suggest that the benefits outweigh any theoretical risks. Studies from the 2009 to 2010 season demonstrated that initiating treatment of pregnant women early (generally &lt;2 days) after onset of influenza symptoms was associated with less severe disease and fewer deaths compared with treatment begun later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/10,17,81-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17,81-84</a>].

However, other data also suggest a benefit if treatment is initiated more than two days after symptom onset. Therefore, treatment should be initiated regardless of the time since symptom onset as the risk of treatment is believed to be low and there may be some benefit even after a prolonged delay, particularly in severely ill pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/influenza-and-pregnancy/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576399145\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of neuraminidase inhibitor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of currently circulating influenza viruses have been susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zanamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zanamivir</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peramivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peramivir</a> (updated resistance information is available at <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsezBItw+WCCsGozO50Q6QIQ=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15870\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cdc.gov/flu</a>).
