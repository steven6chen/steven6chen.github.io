Diabetes self-management education and support <span class=\"nowrap\">(DSME/S)</span> provides the framework and information for preparing a family to take responsibility for the child's diabetes care, and facilitates the transition to self-care as the child matures. <span class=\"nowrap\">DSME/S</span> is an integral component of care for all patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The curriculum, educational principles, and outcomes of <span class=\"nowrap\">DSME/S</span> are outlined in this topic review. <span class=\"nowrap\">DSME/S</span> should be closely coordinated with diabetes medical care, which is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">US NATIONAL STANDARDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1986, the National Diabetes Advisory Board, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), and other professional organizations articulated initial standards of practice for diabetes education programs in the United States. In 2007, revised national standards for diabetes self-management education (DSME) were published that more fully incorporated the needs of diverse patient care settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since 2011, the American Diabetes Association has included DSME in its revised version of Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and recommends that all people with diabetes receive DSME at diagnosis and as needed thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In 2012, the national task force added diabetes self-management support (DSMS) to the national standards, reflecting the need for ongoing maintenance of healthy behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The national standards provide patients with information across nine content areas that represent the core body of knowledge needed by patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes disease process and treatment options</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthy eating</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical activity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using medications and devices safely and for maximal therapeutic effectiveness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring blood glucose and other parameters, and using the results for self-management decisions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventing, detecting, and treating acute and chronic complications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal strategies to address psychosocial issues and concerns</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal strategies to promote health and behavior change (eg, goal-setting)</p><p/><p>The content is presented in different ways depending on the patient's age, literacy level, learning preference, and cultural context. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Individualized curriculum'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Cultural competence'</a> below.)</p><p>The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) are responsible for evaluating and awarding national recognition to DMSE programs that meet 10 defined standards. These standards address the organizational structure of the education program, the annual planning, the credentials of the instructors, the curriculum, and the methods for assessing outcomes. Program recognition is awarded to those education centers that successfully meet the national standards. Such recognition is a prerequisite for Medicare reimbursement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING LEARNER READINESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many fine reference books, videotapes, and pamphlets produced by pharmaceutical companies are available for patients. However, the art and science of relaying health information to individuals with diabetes requires an individualized approach based on assessment of the individual patient's learning needs and readiness to learn. This is especially important for the pediatric patient and his or her parents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Barriers to readiness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not every patient is ready for every piece of information about diabetes. Many variables make learning difficult or impossible. These barriers include the parents' and child's emotional response to the diagnosis. Was the child recently diagnosed? What are <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> fears?</p><p>Other barriers to learner readiness include the family's previous experience with chronic illness or exposure to content from social media. For instance, do other family members have diabetes? How many &quot;horror stories&quot; has the parent heard from social media sources or others? Additional variables that can affect learning are the patient's ability to read, access to a strong support system, and trust in the medical provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Literacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health literacy, or the ability to read, understand, and implement medical directions, has been linked to glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. In a study of 388 individuals, those with inadequate health literacy had worse glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similarly, in a study of 200 families with a child who has type 1 diabetes, a lower level of literacy and numerical skills of the caregiver predicted worse glycemic control in the child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If the child is old enough to participate in diabetes education, assessment of the child's learning, developmental, or cognitive status is warranted to guide the approach to diabetes education.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Social support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Including others in the education program provides needed support for the child or adolescent. Parents, relatives, other caregivers, school personnel, and even friends can be important advocates and helpers, and they should receive the same safety-related information as that provided to the child. School teachers and coaches, bus drivers, and the school nurse particularly need information about the child's diabetes. This can be accomplished through print materials and developing a diabetes plan for the school. The ADA's Safe at School campaign provides a variety of resources for parents. Materials may be accessed through the <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/parents-and-kids/diabetes-care-at-school/&amp;token=A1ahM/l5rbQa9NJsIb8N6HhSVDBSBrkgmI3s/cxUFj+Yo/diLJ8flmZxVDCrlM7BY+vsVLzjVbGwqPcCn88fX52Z7xN3UjaKfOHPq9SPE2w=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5831\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ADA's website</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cultural competence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective diabetes self-management education (DSME) is sensitive to the learner's cultural needs and the barriers to daily living. Kleinman's model for assessing cultural impact has been adapted for diabetes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72192\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72192 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This tool helps the physician or educator to identify health beliefs and cultural practices that may promote or interfere with diabetes self-care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PROVIDING DSME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes self-management education (DSME) requires a multidisciplinary team with expertise in the clinical care of diabetes, medical nutrition therapy, and teaching strategies, usually coordinated by the diabetes educator. With experience and maturity, the patient and family take an increasingly active role in contributing to their educational experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Effective DSME requires a series of contacts with the patient and family. Educators advocate building on survival information and progressing to more advanced content. Survival information includes the &quot;Five S's&quot;: skills, supplies, simple pathophysiology, simple meal planning, and SOS (whom to call for help and when). Each of these categories includes several specific curriculum components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52013 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Once the child and parents have mastered these concepts, more sophisticated information may be provided. This content includes hypoglycemia, sick day care, nutrition (such as carbohydrate counting, label reading), exercise, and diabetes self-care decisions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Teaching strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective teaching strategies encourage active collaboration between healthcare providers, patient, and family. The curriculum emphasizes practical skills, and explores and addresses developmental and psychosocial issues. Behavioral strategies, such as goal setting and problem-solving, are used to sustain self-management efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Individualized curriculum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal education requires assessment of the patient and family's functional health literacy, needs, readiness, health beliefs and attitudes, and financial or physical limitations. The curriculum and educational process is then tailored to meet these needs and expectations. Reassessment and remodeling of the plan is essential, particularly when the patient is a child. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Teachable moments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DSME is an ongoing process. Children and families often exhibit an increased readiness to learn at key developmental or crisis times. The adolescent leaving for college or the young adult facing the onset of nephropathy are examples of people who may be ready and motivated to learn more. These teachable moments are ideal times to address further diabetes self-management issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Scare tactics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generally, scare tactics do not work. Strategies such as showing pictures of amputations to a patient or walking them through the dialysis unit promote fear and anxiety. However, these strategies do not consistently prompt changes in behavior, particularly the long-term behavior changes that are required for optimal health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Furthermore, scare tactics often extinguish hope.</p><p>Despite these considerations, families need to know the potential consequences of long-term hyperglycemia. Such information needs to be factual and should be delivered in a caring, nonthreatening manner. Diabetes education becomes an important component of motivation and adherence. Knowledgeable patients and parents at least have the tools to make decisions about making behavior change.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Time and expertise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective initial DSME may require as much as four to six hours or more of contact with the patient and family. Consequently, many clinicians providing medical diabetes care refer patients to qualified nurses and dietitians for DSME. Expert patient educators may be found among the ranks of certified diabetes educators (CDE), a nationally recognized credential in the field of diabetes education for patients. CDEs can be nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, or health educators. They have additional training and experience in teaching the patient with diabetes. Local diabetes educators may be found through the American Association of Diabetes Educators at <a href=\"http://www.diabeteseducator.org/&amp;token=vt/p3FFwGt2EhhovKxjmBuMXznLvl46A1BgaMSbRKXl7i5NjhvX7zRRGtQZIIDxS&amp;TOPIC_ID=5831\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.diabeteseducator.org</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Reimbursement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasingly, third-party payers and insurance companies are paying for DSME. As of 2016, 46 states and the District of Columbia had legislation mandating coverage for diabetes education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The investment in diabetes self-management education has important economic and personal returns. For every dollar invested in DSME, health care costs can be reduced by $8.76 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term diabetes self-management support (DSMS) is important to optimize lifelong self-management skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. This phase is particularly important for the pediatric age group because of developmental and cognitive changes over time. DSMS may include case management (reminders about follow-up care and tests and access to psychosocial supports), as well as behavioral goal-setting, advanced educational curriculum, and education about any changes in diabetes management techniques (such as the use of an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring).</p><p>Depending on the patient's needs and available resources, DSMS can be provided by a dedicated diabetes educator, or by the patient's diabetes medical provider, or by both in a sequence of alternating visits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of diabetes self-management education (DSME) to the medical management of diabetes is supported by clinical experience in a wide variety of patient groups with type 2 or type 1 diabetes mellitus. The efficacy of DSME is further supported by studies that demonstrate improvements in psychosocial and health outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavior change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary outcome measure for effectiveness of DSME is behavior change. The American Association of Diabetes Educators has identified the following behaviors that are directly and positively affected by DSME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being active</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthy eating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problem-solving</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing risks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthy coping</p><p/><p>Positive behavior changes are correlated with DSME in a variety of studies of adults with type 2 diabetes. As an example, a meta-analysis of studies concerning the effectiveness of diabetes education demonstrated improvements in dietary behaviors, blood glucose monitoring behaviors, and other short-term behavior changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A few studies in adolescents also demonstrate that diabetes education was positively associated with increased use of primary and preventive services, decreased use of inpatient hospital services, and an increased likelihood of following treatment plans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Health outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health outcomes are important secondary goals for DSME; measures of hemoglobin A1c are the most commonly tracked health outcome. Most of the data for this outcome comes from studies of adults with type 2 diabetes. As an example, in a meta-analysis, diabetes education was found to decrease hemoglobin A1c by almost 1 percentage point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This represents a clinically important change, given that each 1 percent reduction in A1c over 10 years is associated with about 20 percent reduction in risk of diabetes complications, as shown in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The cost-effectiveness of DSME was suggested in a large sample of patients with diabetes in a managed care setting. Those who received diabetes education cost the plan 5.7 percent less than members who did not participate in an education program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A few studies describe health outcomes of DSME in patients with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. As an example, a study of adolescents given DSME through a 20 day residential diabetes camp showed improvements in glycemic control as compared to worsening trends in a control group of adolescents who did not attend camp (decrease of 0.3 percent versus increase of 0.5 percent three months after the camp) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. When the subjects were reevaluated about seven months after camp attendance, some improvement was sustained for girls, but not for boys.</p><p>Controlled outcome studies on the impact of education on children with type 1 diabetes are lacking. However, there is suggestive evidence that DSME for children with type 1 diabetes is associated with less health care utilization and perhaps better family functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/self-management-education-for-the-child-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1391380821\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
