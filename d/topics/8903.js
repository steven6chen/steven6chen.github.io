Food (typically meat) bolus impaction above a pre-existing esophageal stricture or ring is by far the most common cause of esophageal body obstruction in adults; by comparison, the majority of foreign bodies in children (76 percent in one large series) are coins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other causes include intentional ingestion in psychiatric patients or prison inmates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>] and, rarely, foreign body impaction as a complication of pill ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Common foreign body ingestions include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fish and chicken bones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication packaging</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dentures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coins</p><p/><p>More than 80 percent of ingested foreign bodies pass without the need for intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, in the setting of intentional ingestions, endoscopic intervention is required in up to 76 percent of patients, and surgical intervention is required in up to 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Special consideration should be given to adolescents with psychiatric illness who may ingest highly dangerous objects such as large button batteries, high-powered magnets, long sharp objects, narcotic packages, and super absorbent objects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Complications of foreign body ingestion or food impaction include ulcer formation, lacerations, perforation, intestinal obstruction, aortoesophageal fistula formation, tracheoesophageal fistula formation, and bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>].</p><p>When foreign bodies become impacted, they often do so at sites of physiologic or pathologic luminal narrowing. The esophagus has three areas of physiologic narrowing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The upper esophageal sphincter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The level of the aortic arch</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diaphragmatic hiatus</p><p/><p>Structural or functional esophageal abnormalities that increase the risk of foreign <span class=\"nowrap\">body/food</span> impaction in the esophagus include diverticula, webs, rings, strictures, achalasia, and tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66623\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66623 \">table 1</a>). In a large series from China, underlying conditions in impactions included esophageal carcinoma (33 percent), stricture (23.9 percent), diverticulum (15.9 percent), postgastrectomy (11.4 percent), hiatal hernia (10.2 percent), and achalasia (5.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Esophageal food impaction is also a common presentation of eosinophilic esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the approach to adults with ingested foreign bodies and food impactions. The approach to foreign body ingestion in children and the conditions that predispose to foreign body or food bolus impaction are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Foreign bodies of the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esophageal-rings-and-webs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Esophageal rings and webs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of benign esophageal strictures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achalasia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zenkers-diverticulum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zenker's diverticulum&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>In 2011, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy published guidelines on the management of ingested foreign bodies and food impactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The discussion that follows is consistent with those guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonimpaired adults and older children can typically identify foreign body ingestion and may point to a specific area of discomfort, though the area often does not correspond with the site of impaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, children, mentally impaired adults, and patients with psychiatric illness may not give a history of foreign body ingestion. In these cases, foreign body impaction may be suspected from the associated symptoms. While symptoms typically develop soon (minutes to days) after ingestion, there have been cases in which foreign bodies were discovered decades later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].</p><p>The typical clinical presentation is the acute onset of dysphagia or complete inability to swallow saliva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/20,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26</a>]. The most common clinical features in a review of 103 patients with history of foreign body ingestion were dysphagia (92 percent) and neck tenderness (60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. An inability to swallow oral secretions is an important symptom since it indicates total obstruction. Other symptoms that can occur include choking, refusal to eat, <span class=\"nowrap\">hypersalivation/drooling,</span> retrosternal fullness, regurgitation of undigested food, wheezing, blood-stained saliva, respiratory distress, and occasionally odynophagia. The latter may indicate spasm but may also suggest laceration or perforation. Some patients will present with signs of a small bowel obstruction such as abdominal pain and distension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms in patients with a perforation will depend upon the site of the perforation. Perforation in the oropharynx or proximal esophagus may cause neck swelling, tenderness, erythema, or crepitus. Perforation in the mid or distal esophagus may result in severe retrosternal chest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> upper abdominal pain, tachypnea, dyspnea, cyanosis, fever, and shock. Perforation of the stomach, small bowel, or colon may present with signs of peritonitis, such as abdominal pain, rebound, guarding, tachycardia, hypotension, and fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain#H1220525403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults#H629462043\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Diffuse abdominal pain syndromes'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many foreign bodies can be detected with plain radiographs. However, some foreign bodies may not be seen on radiographs (such as fish bones). In patients with suspected foreign body ingestions and ongoing esophageal symptoms, endoscopic evaluation is required, even in the setting of negative radiographs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69214981\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain neck, chest, and abdominal radiographs may reveal a radiopaque foreign body or signs of esophageal perforation such as mediastinal, subdiaphragmatic, or subcutaneous air. Radiographic localization and identification of foreign bodies in the esophagus is important prior to any attempt at extraction to localize the foreign body, since this will affect the endoscopic approach. In particular, identification of airway landmarks on posterior-anterior and lateral chest radiographs is important to differentiate between tracheobronchial and esophageal foreign bodies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flat objects, such as coins, usually orient themselves in the coronal plane when lodged in the esophagus and are best seen on anteroposterior projections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76887\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76887 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheal foreign bodies align in the sagittal plane and are best seen on a lateral projection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70775\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70775 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disk batteries may be seen as a double shadow or a stack of coins, depending upon their position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62847\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62847 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77690\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77690 \">image 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not all foreign bodies will be seen on radiographs. Fish bones, chicken bones, wood, plastic, glass, thin metal objects, and food impactions are not readily seen on plain films, so failure to locate an object on radiographic examination does not preclude its presence.</p><p/><p>Computed tomographic (CT) scanning may be helpful if plain radiographs are negative, particularly in patients suspected of having ingested packets of narcotics or other drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. However, examinations using oral contrast, such as a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow, should not be performed, since contrast administration may impair subsequent endoscopic visualization. In cases of sharp or pointed foreign body ingestion, if the result of an initial inspection of the oro- and hypopharynx reveals negative findings, the first imaging modality should be multidetector CT scanning for better diagnosis and management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Careful radiological examination of the foreign body's characteristics, such as its position and composition, is essential for decision-making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69214988\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with persistent esophageal symptoms, an endoscopic evaluation should be performed, even if the radiographic examination is negative. In addition, in patients with suspected nonbony food impactions who do not have evidence of complications, endoscopy may be performed without first obtaining radiographic imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to management depends upon the type of object ingested, the location of the object, and the patient's clinical status. Conservative management is appropriate for the majority of patients, since most objects will pass uneventfully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Patients with negative radiographs who are asymptomatic can be followed expectantly. Other patients will likely require endoscopic or surgical intervention, though the specific approach varies with the type of ingestion and the clinical setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93389\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93389 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients requiring endoscopy can be triaged into one of three groups: those requiring emergent endoscopy, those requiring urgent endoscopy, and those requiring nonurgent endoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68276 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Under no circumstances should a foreign body be allowed to remain in the esophagus beyond 24 hours from presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/2,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,34-36</a>]. Endoscopy under general anesthesia and surgical consultation should be considered in patients in whom the duration of an esophageal foreign body impaction is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69216831\"><span class=\"h3\">Emergent endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergent endoscopy is indicated in patient with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal obstruction (evidenced by an inability to handle oral secretions)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disk batteries in the esophagus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sharp-pointed objects in the esophagus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69216838\"><span class=\"h3\">Urgent endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urgent endoscopy (within 24 hours) is indicated in patients with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal foreign objects that are not sharp-pointed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal food impaction without complete obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sharp-pointed objected in the stomach or duodenum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Objects &gt;6 cm in length at or above the proximal duodenum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnets within endoscopic reach</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69216845\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonurgent endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonurgent endoscopy is indicated in patients with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coins in the esophagus may be observed for 12 to 24 hours in asymptomatic patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunt objects in the stomach that are &gt;2.5 cm in diameter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disk batteries and cylindrical batteries that are in the stomach in patients without signs of gastrointestinal injury may be observed for up to 48 hours (however, disk batteries that are larger than 20 mm are unlikely to pass and should be removed)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunt objects that fail to pass the stomach in three to four weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunt objects distal to the duodenum that remain in the same location for more than a week (deep small bowel enteroscopy or surgery may be required depending on the location of the object)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69216824\"><span class=\"h3\">Foreign bodies that have passed into the stomach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most foreign bodies that enter the stomach will pass in four to six days, and conservative management is appropriate for most blunt objects in asymptomatic patients. As noted above, exceptions include disk batteries, magnets, objects longer than 6 cm, and objects with a diameter &gt;2.5 cm. Patients who are being managed conservatively should have weekly radiographs to follow the progress of the object, and they should be instructed to follow-up immediately should abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting develop. Patients should resume a normal diet and monitor their stools for evidence of the object. An abdominal radiograph one to two days after the patient notes the object in the stool can help confirm passage, provided that the object is radiopaque. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69215188\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway protection is important for all patients undergoing endoscopic foreign body removal. Oropharyngeal suction is required to avoid pulmonary aspiration. Patients with impactions in the upper esophagus may require endotracheal intubation to protect the airway. The use of an overtube should also be considered to prevent an object from accidentally being dropped into the patient's airway. In addition, a laryngoscope should be immediately available in the event of airway obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69215195\"><span class=\"h2\">Equipment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of endoscope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The forward-viewing flexible endoscope has become the instrument of choice in managing foreign bodies in most medical centers because it permits safe extraction of the object and inspection of the esophageal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>]. It can usually be performed under conscious sedation. However, patients with objects that are difficult to remove, who have ingested multiple objects, or with significant psychiatric illness may require endotracheal intubation and general anesthesia. Rigid endoscopy may be required to remove foreign bodies in the upper esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The use of large channel or double channel endoscopes may be advantageous over standard caliber endoscopes since they can facilitate clearance of food particles and other esophageal luminal contents proximal to the foreign body impaction. However, these larger endoscopes are harder to navigate around the foreign body in search of underlying distal esophageal pathology and may not be readily available at all centers. As a result, some endoscopists prefer the smaller, more flexible standard esophagogastroduodenoscopes.</p><p>Both flexible and rigid endoscopic approaches are successful in more than 90 percent of cases, but rigid endoscopy is associated with a higher perforation rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. However, the overall incidence of esophageal perforation with these techniques is low. In a series of 192 adults and children requiring foreign body extraction using rigid or flexible esophagoscopy, no serious complications (mediastinitis, hemorrhage, perforation, or death) were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a second study, perforations occurred in 2 of 63 patients (3 percent) who underwent rigid endoscopy, and no perforations occurred in 76 patients who underwent flexible endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic tools</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Devices that are commonly used for foreign body removal included rat-tooth and alligator forceps, polypectomy snares, baskets, and nets. The rat-tooth forceps and the snare are the most frequently used accessory devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In general, the endoscopic tools used vary with the type of foreign body:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending upon the bolus or foreign body shape, a polypectomy snare, tripod, or stone basket may be used</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coins are best retrieved with a rat-tooth forceps, snare, or retrieval net</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Round objects such as disk or button batteries are best captured using a retrieval net [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]</p><p/><p>Overtubes may be used to protect the airway when removing objects that are difficult to grasp securely and to facilitate passage of the endoscope multiple times for piecemeal removal of a food bolus or to remove multiple objects. Overtubes can also be used to protect the esophageal mucosa when removing sharp objects. Another option for protecting the esophageal mucosa during removal of a sharp object from the stomach is a foreign body protector hood. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Sharp-pointed objects'</a> below.)</p><p>Overtubes are backloaded over the endoscope before the procedure and then slowly advanced with the endoscope into the esophagus (short overtubes) or into the stomach (long overtubes). In some cases, application of the overtube over a meat bolus followed by rigorous suction through the endoscope may suction the bolus into the end of the overtube and facilitate removal.</p><p>All endoscopic manipulations should be performed under maximal esophageal distention using air insufflation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56989054\"><span class=\"h2\">Management based upon the type of ingestion</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Food bolus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A food bolus usually consists of meat lodged above a peptic stricture or ring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74740\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74740 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Patients with total obstruction require immediate intervention. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines suggest that food boluses that are not causing complete obstruction be removed within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, we attempt to remove such boluses within 12 hours in order to avoid pulmonary aspiration. </p><p>The bolus can be removed using grasping devices (either en bloc or piecemeal, depending upon the consistency of the bolus), or it can be gently pushed into the stomach using the endoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. However, excessive force must not be applied since it can result in perforation. If attempts to gently push the bolus into the stomach fail, then the bolus should be removed using a grasping device (preferably via an overtube). A friction-fit adaptor attached to the end of the endoscope can be helpful for aspirating pieces of the food bolus under direct vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/34,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,43,44</a>].</p><p>Endoscopy can be deferred in patients in whom the food bolus impaction resolves spontaneously. However, endoscopy, esophageal biopsy, and in some cases esophageal motility should be performed at a later date because of the high likelihood of an underlying esophageal structural or motor abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/34,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,45</a>].</p><p>If an esophageal stricture or ring is identified after clearing a food bolus, dilation should be performed during the same session, provided there is no significant mucosal inflammation. However, before performing dilation, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) should also be considered, since accumulating data suggest that up to one-half of patients presenting with food impaction have EoE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/19,40,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,40,46</a>]. Dilation should be deferred or performed extremely cautiously if eosinophilic esophagitis is suspected because of the risk of severe chest pain, mucosal tearing, and perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis#H209738\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;, section on 'Esophageal dilation'</a>.)</p><p>Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> (1 mg IV) can be attempted to relax the esophagus, which may promote passage of the food bolus. Studies of glucagon in this setting have had mixed results, with some studies suggesting a benefit while others do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>]. However, glucagon is relatively safe and is a reasonable option, provided its administration does not delay definitive endoscopic therapy. </p><p>Under <strong>no circumstances</strong> should meat tenderizers (such as papain) be administered to patients with food impactions because serious esophageal damage may result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Blunt objects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blunt objects should be removed with equipment that is suited to the shape of the object. Coins, for example, are best removed with foreign body forceps (rat-tooth or alligator), a snare, or a retrieval net [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/2,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,34,35</a>]. Smooth and round objects are more easily removed with a retrieval net or basket [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Objects that cannot be secured in the esophagus may be advanced into the stomach where they may be easier to grasp.</p><p>Blunt objects that have already entered the stomach can usually be managed conservatively since most will pass within four to six days (although it may take as long as four weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/34,54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,54-56</a>]. In adults, objects larger than 2.5 cm are less likely to pass the pylorus and should be removed endoscopically. Patients should consume a regular diet and observe their stools for passage of the object. Weekly radiographs are sufficient in asymptomatic patients. Endoscopic or surgical removal (depending upon the location of the object) should be considered if the object fails to pass out of the stomach within three to four weeks or if an object distal to the duodenum remains in the same location for more than one week. Surgery is also indicated in patients who develop symptoms suggestive of peritonitis, such as fever, vomiting, or abdominal pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Long objects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long objects (longer than 6 to 10 cm) are unlikely to pass the duodenal sweep and should be removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/8,34,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,34,57</a>]. Examples include toothbrushes and spoons. The objects can be grasped with a snare or basket and drawn into a long overtube (ie, &gt;45 cm), after which the entire apparatus can be withdrawn in one motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Sharp-pointed objects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of sharp-pointed objects (such as chicken and fish bones, straightened paper clips, toothpicks, needles, bread-bag clips, and dental bridgework) in the esophagus represents a medical emergency because of the risk of perforation. While sharp-pointed objects that enter the stomach often pass uneventfully through the remainder of the gastrointestinal tract, complications have been described in up to 35 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, they should be removed endoscopically if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/2,5,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,58</a>]. </p><p>Endoscopic management may be difficult if the foreign body pierces the esophageal wall and becomes impacted. Impacted foreign bodies, typically poultry or fish bones, should be treated as early as possible, and their endoscopic management is generally safe and effective. Endoscopic management is the first choice for perforating foreign bodies when the duration of impaction is less than 24 hours and there are no abscesses outside of the esophageal tract or signs of esophageal perforation (eg, pneumomediastinum) seen on a computed tomography (CT) scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Surgical treatment is typically required if an abscess has developed or if there are signs of esophageal perforation. If a foreign body has been impacted for &gt;24 hours and there is no <span class=\"nowrap\">abscess/free</span> air, endoscopic retrieval should be attempted first and management individualized based on the findings. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management of foreign body-induced esophageal perforation'</a> below.)</p><p>For removal of sharp objects in the stomach, a protector hood should be placed at the tip of the endoscope, or a long overtube that spans the esophagogastric junction should be inserted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The bell portion of the flexible endoscopic protector hood is inverted during insertion of the endoscope. The object is then grasped, and the scope is withdrawn. If only one end of the object is pointed, when possible, the object should be grasped so that the sharp end is trailing during removal (ie, pointing away from the endoscope). When the protector hood comes into contact with the esophagogastric junction during withdrawal, the hood is pushed forward, forming a bell that surrounds the tip of the endoscope and the object, protecting the esophageal and pharyngeal mucosa from any sharp edges.</p><p>If endoscopic removal of a sharp-pointed object in the esophagus cannot be achieved safely, patients should be followed with daily radiographs; surgical removal should be considered for objects that do not advance within three consecutive days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] or in patients who develop abdominal pain, vomiting, fevers, hematemesis, or melena. Sword swallowers run a higher risk of injury when they are distracted or adding embellishments to their performance. In these cases, the management of esophageal injury dominates over the foreign body removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Disk batteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disk batteries in the esophagus should be removed promptly. Contact of the flat esophageal wall with both poles of the battery conducts electricity that may rapidly result in liquefaction necrosis and perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. These batteries can be removed with a retrieval basket or net. An alternative technique involves inserting a balloon under direct visualization past the battery, after which it is inflated and then withdrawn to capture the battery between the balloon and the tip of the endoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The balloon, battery, and endoscope can then be removed as one unit. With this type of retrieval method, there is a risk of the battery falling into the trachea, so an overtube <strong>must</strong> be used to protect the airway. If the battery is retrieved by securely capturing it within a retrieval net, an overtube is not required. A battery that cannot be removed from the esophagus can be gently advanced into the stomach where retrieval is sometimes easier. </p><p>Most disk batteries that are in the stomach will subsequently pass through the remaining gastrointestinal tract without consequence. Patients who present with the disk battery in the stomach can be followed with a radiograph every three to four days; 85 percent pass within 72 hours once the battery is beyond the duodenal sweep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Endoscopic removal should be attempted in patients who develop signs or symptoms of gastrointestinal tract injury, those who have ingested batteries larger than 20 mm in diameter, and those in whom the battery remains in the stomach for longer than 48 hours. Emetics are not useful. Cathartics and acid suppression are of unproven benefit, although cathartics may expedite passage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Batteries less than 15 mm in diameter almost never lodge in the esophagus. In one study, while only 3 percent of button batteries were larger than 20 mm, they were responsible for the severe esophageal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. These data suggest that manufacturers could eliminate most complications related to button batteries by replacing large batteries with smaller ones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69215622\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ingested magnets may result in severe gastrointestinal injury because the attractive force between magnets or between a magnet and an ingested metal object can trap a portion of the bowel wall and cause necrosis. This can result in fistula formation, perforation, obstruction, volvulus, or peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. While patients who only report ingestion of one magnet may not be at risk, if additional undetected magnets or pieces of metal were ingested along with the magnet, damage could occur. As a result, all magnets within endoscopic reach should be removed if possible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug packets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug packets ingested by drug traffickers in an attempt to conceal their possession should not be removed endoscopically because of the risk of rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The packets can often be seen radiographically; CT scanning can be helpful, although false-negative results have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Surgery is indicated for patients in whom the packages fail to progress and those with signs of intestinal obstruction or suspected rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Although nonoperative intervention may be acceptable in highly selected patients with contained perforations who are clinically stable, operative intervention is the most conservative and safest approach and is generally considered the treatment of choice, particularly for those seen more than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The surgical management of esophageal perforations is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-esophageal-perforation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of esophageal perforation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other considerations include the nature of the foreign body, the location and the clinical manifestations of perforation, the possible underlying esophageal disease, the results of the various imaging techniques, and the patient's operative risks.

Self-expandable plastic endoluminal esophageal stent placement by a gastroenterologist familiar with their use may also be an effective method for the treatment of acute, iatrogenic perforations of the intrathoracic esophagus. These stents result in rapid leak occlusion, provide the opportunity for early oral nutrition, may significantly reduce hospital length of stay, are removable, and avoid the potential morbidity of operative repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

Clinician follow-up after disimpaction decreased the odds of recurrence. When possible, underlying structural defects that predisposed to the impaction, such as strictures, should be treated.

Food (typically meat) bolus impaction above a pre-existing esophageal stricture or ring is by far the most common cause of esophageal foreign body obstruction in adults. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most ingested foreign bodies pass readily, but some may be impacted behind a physiologic or pathologic luminal narrowing. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typical clinical presentation is the acute onset of dysphagia or complete inability to swallow saliva. An inability to swallow oral secretions is an important symptom since it indicates total obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic localization and identification of foreign bodies in the esophagus is important prior to attempts at extraction in many patients. However, failure to locate an object on radiographic examination does not preclude its presence. In patients with suspected nonbony food impactions who do not have evidence of complications, endoscopy may be performed without first obtaining radiographic imaging. In patients with persistent esophageal symptoms, an endoscopic evaluation should be performed, even if the radiographic examination is negative. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to management depends upon the type of object ingested, the location of the object, and the patient's clinical status. Conservative management is appropriate for the majority of patients since most objects will pass uneventfully. Patients with negative radiographs who are asymptomatic can be followed expectantly. Other patients will likely require endoscopic or surgical intervention, though the specific approach varies with the type of ingestion and the clinical setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68276 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93389\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93389 \">table 2</a>).
