Among those with type 1 diabetes, the incidence of hypertension rises from 5 percent at 10 years, to 33 percent at 20 years, and 70 percent at 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is a <strong>close relation</strong> between the prevalence of hypertension and increasing albuminuria. The blood pressure typically begins to rise within the normal range at or within a few years after the onset of moderately increased albuminuria (the new term for what was previously called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and increases progressively as the renal disease progresses.

Hypertension was present in 19 percent of patients with normoalbuminuria, 30 percent with moderately increased albuminuria, and 65 percent with severely increased albuminuria (the new term for what was previously called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence of hypertension eventually reaches 75 to 85 percent in patients with progressive diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The risk of hypertension is highest in blacks, who are also at much greater risk for renal failure due to diabetic nephropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The findings are different in patients with type 2 diabetes.

In approximately one-half of these patients, the elevation in blood pressure occurred <strong>before</strong> the onset of moderately increased albuminuria. Hypertension was strongly associated with obesity and, not surprisingly, the hypertensive patients were at increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

The excess filtered glucose is reabsorbed (as long as there is only moderate hyperglycemia) in the proximal tubule via a sodium-glucose cotransporter, resulting in a parallel rise in sodium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

This is consistent with the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2017 guidelines, which state that, among patients with a systolic blood pressure &ge;120 mmHg or a diastolic pressure &ge;80, such nonpharmacologic methods should be used to reduce blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Successful implementation of nonpharmacologic therapy may permit later reduction in the dose or number of antihypertensive agents.

Evidence of benefit from treating hypertension in type 2 diabetes has come from multiple trials, including UKPDS, ADVANCE, and HOT, as well as meta-analyses of these and other trials. The separate issue of goal blood pressure is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Goal blood pressure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22080489\"><span class=\"h2\">Meta-analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of 40 trials examined the effects of antihypertensive therapy, compared with placebo or with an alternate antihypertensive drug, in 100,354 diabetic patients; a subset of these patients had a systolic pressure less than or equal to 140 mmHg at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Follow-up among the trials ranged from six months to more than eight years, with most following patients for two years or longer. Compared with placebo, antihypertensive therapy significantly reduced the rates of mortality, total cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. However, analyses that separated patients according to their baseline systolic pressures revealed that, with the exception of stroke, the benefit of antihypertensive therapy was limited to those whose initial systolic pressures were greater than 140 mmHg. Among those with lower initial systolic pressures, antihypertensive therapy reduced the risk of stroke but not the other outcomes.</p><p>In an observational analysis of achieved blood pressure (rather than goal blood pressure) among patients in this meta-analysis, a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure with antihypertensive therapy was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 0.87 (95% CI 0.78-0.96) and a hazard ratio for total cardiovascular disease of 0.89 (95% CI 0.83-0.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, a 10 mmHg decrease in systolic pressure was not significantly associated with a lower risk of these endpoints in analyses that were limited to those whose initial systolic pressure was less than or equal to 140 mmHg.</p><p>Some of the trials included in this meta-analysis compared one antihypertensive drug with another. For most outcomes, no class of drugs was superior to the others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, calcium channel blockers reduced the risk of stroke compared with other agents (relative risk 0.86, 95% CI 0.97-0.77), and beta blockers increased the risk of stroke compared with other agents (relative risk 1.25, 95% CI 1.05-1.50).</p><p>A subsequent meta-analysis (that synthesized results from a set of trials that partially overlapped with the meta-analysis mentioned above) also found benefit from antihypertensive treatment among patients whose baseline systolic pressures were greater than 140 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, unlike the prior meta-analysis, antihypertensive therapy in patients with baseline systolic pressures less than 140 mmHg did not significantly reduce the risk of stroke, and there was a trend toward a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (relative risk 1.15, 95% CI 1.00-1.32).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">UKPDS trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), 1148 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean baseline blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">160/94</span> mmHg) were randomly assigned to a goal blood pressure less than <span class=\"nowrap\">150/85</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;180/105</span> mmHg using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> as primary therapy; the achieved blood pressures in the two groups were <span class=\"nowrap\">144/82</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">154/87</span> mmHg, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>At eight to nine years, patients with the lower blood pressures had a 24 percent reduction in diabetes-related endpoints, including microvascular disease (37 versus 49 percent, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77963\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77963 \">figure 1</a>)), a 32 percent reduction in deaths related to diabetes (24 versus 35 percent), 44 percent fewer strokes, and a 34 and 47 percent reduction in significant deterioration in retinopathy and visual acuity, respectively.</p><p>These benefits required continued maintenance of a lower blood pressure. In the UKPDS, there was a median of eight years of post-trial monitoring in which no attempt was made to maintain the assigned therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The greater reduction in blood pressure and the lower risk of complications in the patients assigned to tight blood pressure control was lost within two years of termination and the significant improvements in clinical endpoints were not sustained.</p><p>A subsequent observational report that utilized data from the UKPDS trial evaluated the risk of complications according to the systolic blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There was an inverse correlation between the updated mean systolic blood pressure and the aggregate endpoint at 10-year follow-up for any complication related to diabetes (myocardial infarction, sudden death, angina, stroke, renal failure, lower-extremity amputation or death from peripheral artery disease, death from hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, heart failure, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal photocoagulation, and cataract extraction). Each 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure was associated with a 12 percent risk reduction; the lowest risk occurred at a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77963\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77963 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>However, UKPDS was not designed to assess the efficacy of systolic pressures below 140 mmHg. Thus, these observations do not provide any primary evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between lower systolic pressures and better patient outcomes. The ACCORD BP trial described below specifically addressed the issue of goal blood pressure less than 120 mmHg and found no benefit. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'ACCORD BP trial'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">HOT trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The details of the Hypertension Optimal Treatment&nbsp;(HOT) trial are described separately. Summarized briefly, almost 19,000 patients (average pretreatment blood pressure of <span class=\"nowrap\">170/105</span> mmHg) were randomly assigned to target diastolic pressures of &le;90, &le;85, or &le;80 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, less separation in the diastolic blood pressure was achieved among the three target groups than had been planned as the mean diastolic blood pressures attained in the three groups were <span class=\"nowrap\">144/85,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">141/83,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">140/81</span> mmHg, respectively. Among the 3000 patients with diabetes, but not in other patients, the relative risk of a cardiovascular event was significantly reduced in the &le;80 mmHg group compared to the &le;90 mmHg group (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29-0.81).

The results of the glycemic control arm are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'ADVANCE'</a>.)</p><p>The ADVANCE trial is the only major <strong>placebo-controlled</strong> randomized trial that specifically evaluated antihypertensive therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, the attained blood pressures in ADVANCE were lower than in the UKPDS and HOT trials described above.</p><p>ADVANCE compared the use of a fixed combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perindopril-and-indapamide-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">perindopril-indapamide</a> to placebo in over 11,000 patients with type 2 diabetes. The majority of patients had a history of hypertension and the mean blood pressure at baseline was <span class=\"nowrap\">145/81</span> mmHg. A target blood pressure was not used to guide protocol therapy, and all other agents, except angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and thiazides, were initiated at the discretion of the treating clinicians. The primary endpoints were macrovascular events (death from cardiovascular disease, nonfatal stroke or nonfatal myocardial infarction) or microvascular events (development of proteinuria, doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of renal replacement therapy, death due to renal causes, or retinopathy).</p><p>After a mean of 4.3 years, the following significant differences were observed in the group assigned to active treatment compared with placebo:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decrease in mean blood pressure by 5.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/2</span>.2 mmHg.

Blood pressures between the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perindopril-and-indapamide-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">perindopril-indapamide</a> and placebo groups, which were different during the trial, became similar within six months after completion of the trial and remained similar throughout the observational cohort phase. Compared with those originally assigned placebo, those who had been assigned perindopril-indapamide had a lower death rate during the cohort phase (15.3 versus 16.7 percent), as well as a lower incidence of major cardiovascular events (13.3 versus 14.2 percent). Combining both the trial and cohort phases (approximately 10 years of follow-up), all-cause mortality was significantly lower among those in the treatment group (hazard ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.99).</p><p>Thus, lower blood pressures were associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. Other benefits, which are discussed separately, included lower rates of development and progression of diabetic nephropathy.

The 2017 American Diabetes Association (ADA) consensus report, while endorsing the highest level of evidence for <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;140/90</span> mmHg, specifically states that attaining lower blood pressure levels (between 125 to 130 mmHg) should be attempted, if tolerated, to prevent cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, these guidelines suggest maintaining a diastolic blood pressure &ge;60 mmHg in older adults.</p><p>Support for these recommendations comes from randomized trials, meta-analyses, and large observational studies.

As an example, a meta-analysis of 19 goal blood pressure trials (including five trials of diabetic patients) combining 44,989 patients found a significant reduction in major cardiovascular events with more intensive as compared with less intensive blood pressure lowering (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The effect of intensive blood pressure lowering in the five trials of diabetic patients was similar (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.96) to the effect in the other trials. All-cause mortality was also lower with intensive treatment, but this was not statistically significant (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81-1.03).</p><p>In addition, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) found that, among nondiabetic patients at high cardiovascular risk, targeting a systolic pressure less than 120 mmHg compared with less than 140 mmHg reduced cardiovascular events and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Blood pressure during the trial was measured using automated oscillometric blood pressure (AOBP) and <strong>not</strong> using manual (ausculatory) blood pressure (perhaps more commonly used in routine practice), typically yielding readings that are 5 to 10 mm lower than with manual measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In addition, most patients in the intensive blood pressure lowering group were not able to attain a systolic pressure less than 120 mmHg (mean systolic pressure was 121 mmHg). Thus, SPRINT provides evidence in nondiabetic patients at high cardiovascular risk for targeting a systolic pressure of 120 to 125 mmHg if AOBP is used and, because of typical differences between the methods of measurement, a systolic pressure of 125 to 130 mmHg if manual ausculatory measurements are used. A detailed discussion of SPRINT and goal blood pressure in nondiabetic patients is presented elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;</a>).
