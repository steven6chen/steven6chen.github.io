Quick-relief agents include short-acting beta agonists (SABAs), anticholinergic bronchodilators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ipratropium</a> bromide), and short-term systemic glucocorticoids.</p><p>Medications used for the quick relief of asthma symptoms in children younger than 12 years of age are reviewed here.

SABAs relax airway smooth muscle, leading to a prompt increase in airflow. These drugs generally provide rapid relief of acute asthma symptoms (eg, coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath), with a time to onset of action of approximately 5 to 10 minutes, peak effect beginning within approximately 50 minutes, and duration of action of approximately three to six hours. Thus, as-needed use of these drugs is the primary therapy for acute symptoms in patients with intermittent asthma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76669\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76669 \">figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67459 \">figure 1B</a>) and also is first-line therapy in patients with acute exacerbations.

However, SABAs should not be prescribed on a regular schedule, because of concerns about a possible relationship between the frequent use of these agents and deteriorating asthma control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-rescue-treatment-for-acute-symptoms/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. The rapid relief provided by SABAs may invite misuse and overuse, such that other medical intervention may be delayed beyond a safe point in an asthma exacerbation. Frequent use of SABAs is an indication of poor asthma control and should prompt increased use of controller therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76669%7EPULM%2F67459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76669 graphicRef67459 \">figure 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78322%7EPULM%2F64986\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78322 graphicRef64986 \">table 1A-B</a>).
