Accordingly, not only is accurate measurement of platelet function critical for identifying patients with platelet dysfunction or hyperfunction, but it also is becoming increasingly important for the monitoring of modern antiplatelet therapy.</p><p>The history of platelet function testing began over 100 years ago when platelets were first identified as distinct circulating cells, rather than fragments, and it was found that they were vital for both hemostasis and thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Despite these early observations, for the majority of the 20<sup>th</sup> century the only means of assessing platelet function were a small number of fairly unreliable tests (eg, manual platelet count, inspection of the peripheral blood smear, bleeding time).</p><p>A major problem concerning the testing of platelet function is the difficulty in simulating hemostasis in vitro. In addition, platelets are sensitive to manipulation, and are prone to artifactual in vitro activation. Early attempts to simulate hemostasis in vitro included methods in which platelets were counted before and after exposure to foreign surfaces (eg, glass columns) or thrombus formation was monitored within closed plastic tube loops. Many of these early tests remained as research tools because of their technical difficulty, and were thus restricted to specialized centers.</p><p>The ability to test platelet function in the routine laboratory improved with the introduction of platelet aggregometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Remarkably, further advances in laboratory platelet analysis have lagged behind both the functional and molecular analysis of the <span class=\"nowrap\">coagulation/fibrinolytic</span> system. The table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59857\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59857 \">table 1</a>) illustrates the small number of tests that were available up to the late 1980s. The availability of newer and more reliable platelet function analyzers, flow cytometry, and molecular biological techniques is changing our approach to platelet function analysis. Another table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52144\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52144 \">table 2</a>) lists a number of relatively new platelet function tests that are currently available.</p><p>This topic review will present a brief history of platelet function testing, and will review major advances in the analysis of platelet function.</p><p>Related issues are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inherited and acquired disorders of platelet function &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired disorders of platelet function&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Automated hematology instrumentation &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-hematology-instrumentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated hematology instrumentation&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonresponse-and-resistance-to-aspirin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonresponse and resistance to aspirin&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clopidogrel resistance and clopidogrel treatment failure&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PLATELET COUNTING METHODS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Manual platelet counting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The platelet count continues to be used as a first-line test of platelet function. Before the introduction of automated cell counters, the platelet count was performed manually. In fact, the manual count, using phase contrast microscopy, is still the gold standard international reference method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. However, this procedure is imprecise, with typical coefficients of variation (CV) in the range of 15 to 25 percent, making this method totally impractical for calibrating automated cell counters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Automated cell counter methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although modern automated cell counters are rapid, precise, and reproducible, they tend to overestimate the platelet count in samples that contain cellular debris (eg, thalassemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, leukemia). Conversely, in patients with large platelets, as in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], the platelet count is underestimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-hematology-instrumentation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated hematology instrumentation&quot;, section on 'Platelet count and size'</a>.)</p><p>An accurate estimation of the peripheral blood platelet count, especially in patients with extreme degrees of thrombocytopenia, is becoming extremely relevant, given that the platelet transfusion threshold is now set at <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> and that certain degrees of thrombocytopenia may initiate different treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/6,8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8-12</a>].

These methods increase the accuracy of the count, as compared with impedance methods, as both normal and large sized platelets are easily discriminated from noise, cellular debris, and other cell populations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-hematology-instrumentation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated hematology instrumentation&quot;, section on 'Cell counting by light scattering'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Flow cytometric methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optical counters agree more closely with a flow cytometric procedure. In this latter method, platelets are identified via analysis of samples incubated with a fluorescent monoclonal antibody directed against an antigen on the surface of the platelet (eg, anti-CD61 and anti-CD41a) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/5,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15,16</a>]. The platelet count is derived by dividing the number of fluorescent platelets counted by the number of red blood cell events (RBC ratio) and then multiplying this ratio by the RBC count provided by a suitably calibrated impedance analyzer.</p><p>This method is independent of both pipetting and dilution artifacts, provided that sufficient platelets are counted and that samples are optimally diluted to insure that cells are counted one by one, rather than in groups of two or more. The derived platelet counts are not only highly accurate, but are also precise, with typical coefficients of variation (CVs) of less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>]. Given the clear superiority of this method to the manual count, the <span class=\"nowrap\">ICSH/ISLH</span> have proposed that the method could become the new international reference method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The immunoplatelet CD61 method is also available on an automated cell counter, the Abbott CELL DYN 4000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,19</a>].

However, for platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;25,000/microL,</span> the optical method tended to overestimate the platelet count (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80032 \">figure 1</a>). The lowest absolute platelet count which these methods could reliably distinguish from true zero was <span class=\"nowrap\">1730/microL</span> for the optical method and 20 and <span class=\"nowrap\">9/microL</span> for the anti-CD41a and the anti-CD61 immunoplatelet methods, respectively.</p><p>Given these improvements, increasing the accuracy of platelet counting in the ranges encountered in patients with severe thrombocytopenia (ie, platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;20,000/microL)</span> might result in further reduction in the platelet transfusion threshold to as low as <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL,</span> without an associated increase in bleeding risk. This could result in further cost savings by decreasing the frequency of unnecessary platelet transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>However, it has been suggested that the majority of full blood counters overestimate platelet counts in patients with severe thrombocytopenia and that, as a result, patients may be under-transfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Further work is in progress to study the full impact of inaccurate platelet counting in thrombocytopenic patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Platelet count ratio method for platelet function testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When platelets within anticoagulated whole blood samples are stimulated by agonists (eg, adenosine diphosphate [ADP], epinephrine, ristocetin), they form aggregates, with a resulting reduction in the number of free platelets. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Platelet aggregometry'</a> below.)</p><p>By counting the number of platelets in a control sample and a sample that has been activated by ADP, it is possible to assess platelet function via a platelet count ratio (ie, the control platelet count divided by the platelet count after addition of an appropriate agonist). This ratio correlates well with the results of platelet aggregometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and can be performed on available automated cell counters, using commercially available reagents (eg, Plateletworks).</p><p>A whole blood platelet function assay using the ICHOR Point of Care Hematology Counter has been developed to count samples pre- and post-activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This instrument provides a means of assessing both platelet count and function within an acute care environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Platelet counting can also be performed before and after exposure of samples to foreign surfaces (eg, glass columns).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PLATELET AGGREGOMETRY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Classical platelet aggregometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Turbidometric platelet aggregometry, developed in the 1960s, revolutionized the ability to identify and diagnose alterations in platelet function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and soon became the &quot;gold standard&quot; for platelet function testing. In this technique, blood is centrifuged at sufficiently low force to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which is stirred in a cuvette at 37&ordm;C between a light source and a measuring photocell. Upon addition of an agonist, such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), platelets aggregate; the resultant increased transmission of light (ie, reduced turbidity of the PRP) is detected and recorded as a function of time after addition of the reagent. These changes reflect the formation of relatively large platelet aggregates, which are in turn derived from microaggregates.</p><p>The use of a panel of platelet agonists (eg, collagen, ADP, epinephrine, ristocetin) at a range of concentrations triggers classical platelet responses, including shape change as well as primary and secondary aggregation. The recorded response depends upon the normal functioning of the platelet, the presence of inhibitors of platelet function, as well as the concentration of agonist, facilitating detection of classical platelet disorders based upon the pattern of aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A number of classical examples are shown on the accompanying figure and table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56188\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56188 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69518\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69518 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>A great deal of information can be obtained via aggregometry, although the test is labor intensive, requires careful quality control, and a fair degree of technical expertise in its performance and interpretation. Although modern aggregometers with multi-channel capability, computer control, and the ability to measure ADP release via luminescence have improved the technology, the test is currently limited to specialized laboratories and is not well standardized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p>There are a number of efforts in progress to improve standardization, including new guidelines from various societies.</p><p>Comparative testing suggests that turbidimetric aggregometry underestimates both the degree and duration of inhibition by <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-GpIIb/IIIa</span> therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abciximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abciximab</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Whole blood aggregometry'</a> below.)</p><p>Evidence has also been accumulating that turbidimetric aggregometry is not sensitive enough to monitor the formation of platelet micro-aggregates or for monitoring platelet function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. For example, it has been suggested that aggregates comprised of less than 100 platelets cannot be detected by the turbidometric technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Aggregometry is thus relatively insensitive for either detecting preexisting aggregates or monitoring the early phase of aggregation. This may be particularly important for studying aggregates in patients with platelet hyperfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Whole blood aggregometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of platelet aggregation within whole blood by electrical impedance was developed in response to the difficulties inherent in aggregometry noted above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In this method, whole blood is stirred at 37&ordm;C between two platinum wire electrodes set at a fixed distance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The electrode becomes covered with platelets, with further adhesion of platelet aggregates after addition of agonists. The mass of platelets sticking onto the electrodes changes the impedance with time, which is monitored on a recorder.</p><p>Comparative studies indicate that this method gives results similar to those obtained via classical turbidimetric aggregometry, and outperforms turbidometric methods when monitoring anti-platelet therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/23,30,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,30,36</a>]. Similar to conventional aggregometry, whole blood aggregation impedance methods are relatively insensitive to the presence of smaller platelet aggregates. Within-donor variation tends to be slightly higher than with conventional aggregometry and the test still requires technical expertise and is relatively expensive. A multichannel (5 channels) impedance-based analyzer (Multiplate system) has become available and includes disposable cuvettes and standardized reagents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>This method is proving to be useful for diagnosing platelet defects and monitoring <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, and is in widespread use in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Light scattering methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Particle size analysis by flow cytometry is very accurate, not only for counting platelets, but also for monitoring formation of small (and large) aggregates during the early aggregation phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Continuous measurement of platelet aggregation is not possible with this method alone, and disaggregation can occur during dilution procedures if the samples are not appropriately handled.</p><p>An aggregometer (PA-200, Kowa Ltd) has been developed that uses a combination of laser light scattering and aggregometry to monitor the continuous formation of platelet microaggregates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. The test is sensitive enough to detect aggregates containing only two or three platelets. The method employed by this apparatus is based on the observation that the intensity of light scatter is proportional to the size of the aggregates formed. This is accomplished by focusing on a limited area of the platelet-rich plasma in the cuvette and detecting high intensity light scatter at 90 degrees, via a series of lenses.</p><p>Platelet aggregation assessed in this manner correlates well with conventional aggregometry in samples showing gross changes in light transmission. However, the light scatter technique can detect small aggregates (the primary aggregation response) that are not detectable via light transmission in the conventional aggregometer; the larger aggregates (the secondary aggregation response) are detected by both methods. The instrument not only measures both the size and number of platelet aggregates but also uses more physiologic concentrations of agonists, at concentrations which may be reduced by up to three orders of magnitude, compared with those used in light transmission techniques.</p><p>This technology may prove useful for detecting platelet hyperreactivity in a variety of disease states (eg, acute coronary syndromes, stroke, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) in response to low concentrations of various agonists. As an example, spontaneous formation of small aggregates (&lt;100 platelets) has been observed in patients with acute coronary syndromes, but not in controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Further, upon agonist stimulation the EC50 for epinephrine-induced primary aggregation was 50 times lower in these patients than in controls, while the EC50 for secondary aggregation was only two times lower. This observation suggests that platelet hypersensitivity is only detectable by primary aggregation of microaggregates in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">The VerifyNow Assay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This test was previously known as the Ultegra Rapid Platelet Function Assay (RPFA).</p><p>Data from recent clinical trials (eg, EPIC, EPILOG) have suggested that &gt;80 percent of platelet receptors need to be blocked in order to achieve significant clinical efficacy with antiplatelet agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Monitoring of receptor blockade is thus becoming crucial in order to ensure optimal dosing and maximal clinical benefit for individual patients at risk of developing ischemic complications (eg, during percutaneous coronary intervention) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Given the increased use of both oral and infused <span class=\"nowrap\">GpIIb/IIIa</span> antagonists, there exists a demand for a simple, cheap, and rapid method that could be used at the bedside and clinic in order to monitor anti-platelet therapy in a standardized fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].</p><p>A modified platelet aggregometry device has been developed in order to provide a simple and rapid functional means of monitoring <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-GpIIb/IIIa</span> therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abciximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abciximab</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Consequent platelet activation results in the formation of a primary hemostatic plug with clot stabilization via fibrin formation. Alternatively, the blood sample can be exposed to a small amount of collagen, which results in thrombus formation and complete stenosis of the tube.</p><p>A commercial form of this instrument, called the clot signature analyzer (CSA), measures both hemostatic plug formation in the &quot;punch&quot; and collagen channels within a disposable plastic cassette [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>], providing a global assessment of hemostasis under controlled conditions.

The test involves drawing whole blood through a capillary tube. The resulting hemodynamic forces induce platelet activation and capillary tube occlusion. After stabilization and upon compression of the platelet-rich thrombus, thrombolysis can also be measured.

The test records a parameter called the closure time (CT).</p><p>The test is simple, rapid, does not require specialist training, and is a potential screening tool for assessing hemostatic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. It is particularly advantageous in the pediatric setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The test could potentially replace the in vivo bleeding time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>] and serve as a screening tool for assessing platelet dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/65,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,69</a>]. As with the in vivo bleeding time, this test is sensitive to both the platelet count and hematocrit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]; it is therefore recommended that a complete blood count be performed along with each test.</p><p>Although abnormal closure times are an indication of platelet dysfunction, they are not specific for any disorder, and should not be used for general screening purposes without knowledge of other variables that influence the test (eg, VWF levels, complete blood count, other platelet function tests) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. This test also has limited value in the diagnosis of patients presenting with mucocutaneous bleeding, due to its low sensitivity for the detection of primary secretion defects and storage pool disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Use in von Willebrand disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data confirm that the above testing system is highly dependent on VWF and is useful for evaluating patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) as well as monitoring therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (DDAVP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;, section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>).

The system consists of a cone and plate device in which a blood sample is exposed to a plate under arterial flow conditions for a few minutes. Platelet adhesion and aggregation on the surface of the plate are monitored by an image analyzer. The interaction of platelets with the substrate is totally dependent upon presence of <span class=\"nowrap\">GpIIb/IIIa,</span> GpIb, and plasma VWF.</p><p>The CPA, either as a semi- or fully automated system, has been used to monitor defects in primary hemostasis, <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-GpIIb/IIIa</span> therapy, hyperreactive platelets, to monitor thrombocytopenic patients for bleeding risk, and for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/85,87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,87,88</a>]. The main advantages of this system are that it uses a small volume of blood (150 to 250 microL), yields results in 5 to 15 minutes, and exhibits a close resemblance to in vivo physiological conditions.</p><p>The test is now commercially available as the IMPACT (immediate microscopic platelet adhesion cone and plate technology) device and uses disposable polystyrene plates. The test measures platelet adhesion and aggregation using 130 microL of whole blood that has been pipetted onto the polystyrene plate and exposed to a shear rate of <span class=\"nowrap\">1800/second</span> for two minutes. Surface bound platelets are imaged and quantified by image analysis software after washing and staining. The test displays two parameters: surface coverage (SC) and average size (AS). The SC is a measure of the percentage of the plate covered by platelets, and the AS is the means size of surface bound objects. The test is apparently sensitive to afibrinogenemia, VWD, Glanzmann thrombasthenia, and Bernard-Soulier syndrome. However, widespread experience with this device is limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">High shear filterometer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A simple method for assessing high shear-dependent platelet function has been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In this test, anticoagulated blood is forced under controlled pressure through a fine glass fiber filter. The combination of shear forces and foreign surfaces activates the platelets, resulting in aggregate formation culminating in a blockade of the filter. Platelets are counted prior to filtration and at various time points thereafter in order to calculate the percentage of platelets retained in the filter. Because of the high shear conditions, the test is highly dependent upon GpIb, VWF and <span class=\"nowrap\">GpIIb/IIIa,</span> and theoretically can be used as a sensitive test for various types of platelet dysfunction.</p><p>In one study of over 2500 men, tests of platelet function were performed to determine whether they could predict development of myocardial infarction or stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

Abnormal clot retraction may reflect deficiencies in platelet number, platelet glycoproteins, release of activating agents, or fibrinogen levels. A number of instruments have been developed that can accurately measure various physical properties of the clot with time. Two such commercial instruments will be discussed here: the thromboelastography (TEGR) and Hemodyne devices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Thromboelastography (TEG)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thromboelastography (TEG) tests both platelet function and coagulation by assaying several parameters of clot formation dynamically in whole blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100078 \">figure 3</a>). There are several devices available commercially to measure TEG at the bedside or point of care. While the specifics of the devices vary, they all measure the same general parameters. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TEG and related rapid TEG (r-TEG) devices monitor the interaction of platelets within the fibrin mesh of the clot during clot formation and lysis over time. The physical property of the clot is measured by use of a cylindrical cup that holds a whole blood sample at 37&ordm;C and is oscillated to and fro with a rotation cycle of 10 seconds. As the clot forms, the torque of the rotating cup is transmitted to an immersed pin. The degree of pin rotation is converted to an electrical signal via a transducer and monitored via a chart recorder. The strength of the developing clot increases the magnitude of the output, whereas during clot lysis, the bonds between the cup and the pin are broken, and the signal decreases. The forces that are generated are used to measure the clotting time, kinetics of clot initiation, clot strength, and clot lysis over time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74954\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74954 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ROTEM (Rotational Thromboelastometry) device is an adaptation of the TEG in which the cup remains stationary and the pin rotates directly in the sample.

During platelet activation, contractile forces within the cytoskeleton mediate both shape change and pseudopod formation. The platelets then adhere to the fibrin mesh via surface receptors (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">GpIIb/IIIa)</span> on the pseudopods. Once the clot is fully formed, the platelets begin a process of clot retraction, placing the entire clot under stress, resulting in the collapse of the clot and reduction in size.</p><p>The Hemodyne instrument, based on a previously described technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>], facilitates a direct measurement of these forces. The test is performed by placing a small sample (800 microL) of either citrated whole blood or platelet rich plasma within a sample cup between two parallel plates. Upon addition of thrombin or other agonists, platelets within the sample attach to the plates and extend their pseudopodia along polymerizing strands of fibrin. Once the <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrin/platelet</span> network is sufficiently formed, platelet contractile forces begin to transmit outwards to the plates and are detected by a transducer, the output of which is proportional to the generated force. Two key properties are measured simultaneously:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet contractile force (PCF) &ndash; The force exerted by activated platelets on the fibrin network</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elastic modulus (EM) &ndash; The elastic modulus (clot rigidity), a measure of the physical structure of the <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrin/cellular</span> network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]</p><p/><p>PCF is decreased in thrombocytopenia, various acquired and congenital platelet abnormalities (eg, uremia, Glanzmann thrombasthenia, during cardiopulmonary bypass) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>], and <span class=\"nowrap\">GpIIb/IIIa</span> inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Clot EM is influenced by fibrinogen concentration and is measurable in the absence of platelets. It may also be sensitive to clotting factor deficiencies, anticoagulant effects, and in multiple myeloma. Overall, low PCF values appear to predict a bleeding risk, while high <span class=\"nowrap\">PCF/EM</span> values may predict a thrombotic tendency (eg, coronary artery disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASUREMENT OF PLATELET ACTIVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of tests have been developed to measure reactivity of circulating platelets <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to show that platelets have been activated in vivo. The difficulty with these methods is the prevention of artifactual platelet activation during the processing of the blood sample. The earliest measurements included the detection of platelet aggregates within blood samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>], measuring threshold aggregation responses to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or arachidonate, and testing for the presence of spontaneous aggregation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Soluble activation markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another method of assessing platelet activation is measurement of platelet release products within platelet poor plasma, some of which, however, are not specific to platelets. In these methods, blood samples are usually collected into tubes containing inhibitors of platelet activation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> and PGE1).</p><p>The most useful tests are assays for platelet-specific proteins, such as platelet factor 4 and beta thromboglobulin. These proteins are released from the alpha granules upon platelet activation and aggregation, although careful venipuncture and blood handling are essential to avoid artifactually high levels. The ratio of these two proteins often indicates if there has been a problem with artifactually induced activation.</p><p>Other platelet activation assays have included thromboxane B2 measurement (a metabolite of thromboxane A2) within both plasma and urine, as well as uptake and release of radiolabeled serotonin from the dense granules. These assays have a number of disadvantages, including false elevation of levels due to sample handling, insensitivity, need for radioactive materials, and high cost.</p><p>Soluble P-selectin is also derived from activated platelets and can be measured as a marker of platelet activation in platelet poor plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. P-Selectin or CD62p is an alpha granular membrane protein, which is expressed only on the surface of activated platelets and can be detected by flow cytometry.

Thus, the levels of CD62p on the platelet surface may not be a true reflection of the in vivo activation state of platelets and should be complemented by measurements of all other markers including soluble P-selectin. A full spectrum of all activation markers should be measured, especially since the time frame of expression for each marker is unknown.</p><p>Activated platelets have been demonstrated in a wide variety of disorders, including acute coronary syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/110,113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,113,114</a>], stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/115,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">115,116</a>], antiphospholipid syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>], and during angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. The study of platelet activation markers thus has the potential to optimize antiplatelet therapy (eg <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-GpIIb/IIIa</span> drugs) and to be used as a predictor of thrombotic events after invasive techniques (eg, angioplasty) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p>One of the problems with measuring the activation status or reactivity of circulating platelets is that the clinical picture is incomplete, since fully activated platelets within thrombi and clots are unlikely to circulate. Measurement of platelet-leukocyte complexes may be a more sensitive marker of in vivo platelet activation. By using a double labeling technique, it is possible to study aggregates of platelets with both neutrophils and monocytes by flow cytometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. When platelets become activated they can bind to monocytes and neutrophils by a number of different receptor-ligand pairs or bridges (eg, CD62p &ndash; PSGL1, CD36 &ndash; TSP &ndash; CD36, Mac1 &ndash; Fg &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">GpIIb/IIIa,</span> and CD40L &ndash; CD40). Increased numbers of circulating platelet-leukocyte complexes have been demonstrated in patients with myocardial infarction, unstable and stable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>], and during cardiopulmonary bypass.</p><p>Circulating monocyte-platelet complexes may be a relatively stable and a more sensitive marker than other activation dependent markers (eg, P-selectin). The platelets induce tissue factor expression after binding to monocytes, perhaps increasing a prothrombotic tendency in such conditions as meningococcal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>], sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>], preeclampsia, and acute coronary syndromes.</p><p>Flow cytometric analysis of platelets can also be used to count platelets accurately (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Platelet counting methods'</a> above), diagnose various glycoprotein deficiencies (eg, Bernard-Soulier syndrome and Glanzmann thrombasthenia) and to study platelets from patients with defective aggregation, secretion, microparticle generation, or procoagulant activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/121-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-123</a>].</p><p>By using the dye Mepacrine in conjunction with platelet activation in vitro it is possible to diagnose dense granule deficiency and storage pool disease (both storage and release defects) in a simple and reproducible assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">124,125</a>]. This assay is simpler than either the luminescence or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays that measure intracellular or released ADP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Reticulated platelets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nucleic acid-specific dyes can be used to measure young platelets that contain residual RNA. These young platelets are analogous to red cell reticulocytes and have thus been termed reticulated platelets. Although there is evidence to support that the youngest platelets are being measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,128</a>], it is possible that the dense granular component of the larger young platelets is also contributing to the signal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/129,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,130</a>]. Assays can now be optimized in order to control for this problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-hematology-instrumentation#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated hematology instrumentation&quot;, section on 'Reticulated platelets'</a>.)</p><p>The assay for reticulated platelets is a simple, noninvasive method of assessing platelet turnover or thrombopoiesis in different types of thrombocytopenia, is a simple predictor of bone marrow recovery after transplantation, and can be used to monitor the response to therapy with growth factors such as thrombopoietin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. Additional clinical studies will need to be performed before the assay may be reliably used as a predictor of thrombosis in patients with myeloproliferative syndromes, such as essential thrombocythemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>].</p><p>The test is now available as an additional fully automated complete blood count parameter called the Immature Platelet Fraction (IPF) that uses IPF master software within the Sysmex XE2100 analyzer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/platelet-function-testing/abstract/134,135\" class=\"abstract_t\">134,135</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18121816\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the evaluation of platelet numbers and morphology by examination of the peripheral blood smear, a number of tests of platelet function are available to the clinician (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59857\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59857 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52144\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52144 \">table 2</a>).
