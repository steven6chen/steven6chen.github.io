In many such patients, particularly young adult patients, the hematuria is transient and of no consequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. On the other hand, there is an appreciable risk of malignancy in older patients (eg, over age 35 years) with hematuria, even if transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, even among older patients, a urologic cause for the hematuria can often not be identified (61 percent in a series of 1930 patients referred to a hematuria clinic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The color change does not necessarily reflect the degree of blood loss, since as little as 1 mL of blood per liter of urine can induce a visible color change. In addition, the intermittent excretion of red to brown urine can be seen in a variety of clinical conditions other than bleeding into the urinary tract (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Red to brown urine'</a>). Gross hematuria with passage of clots usually indicates a lower urinary tract source but can be seen with some forms of intrarenal bleeding (eg, kidney cancer, immunoglobulin A [IgA] nephropathy).</p><p>As contamination with blood is a possibility in menstruating and postpartum women, urine for analysis is best obtained when the other cause of bleeding has ceased. If this is not possible, a tampon can be inserted, and urinalysis can be obtained after the perineum is cleansed.</p><p>The initial step in the evaluation of patients with red urine is centrifugation of the specimen to see if the red or brown color is in the urine sediment or the supernatant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55923\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55923 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Hematuria is responsible if the red to brown color is seen only in the urine sediment, with the supernatant being clear. A rare exception is that lysis of red blood cells (RBCs) in patients with gross hematuria and very dilute urine can result in a red supernatant.</p><p>If, on the other hand, it is the supernatant that is red to brown, then the supernatant should be tested for heme (hemoglobin or myoglobin) with a urine dipstick:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A red to brown supernatant that is negative for heme (hemoglobin or myoglobin) is a rare finding that can be seen in several conditions, including porphyria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56337\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56337 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57844\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57844 \">picture 1</a>), the use of the bladder analgesic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenazopyridine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenazopyridine</a>, and the ingestion of beets in susceptible subjects.

Kidney biopsy shows distension of many renal tubules by intratubular RBCs and tubular cell injury consistent with acute tubular necrosis. This association has been best described in patients with IgA nephropathy but has also been noted in case reports of patients with thin basement membrane disease and lupus nephritis who were over-anticoagulated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (international normalized ratio [INR] &gt;4.0) or other anticoagulants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].

Although abnormal hematuria is commonly defined as the presence of three or more RBCs per high-power field in a spun urine sediment, there is no &quot;safe&quot; lower limit below which significant disease can be excluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80282\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80282 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Lowering the cut-off value of RBCs chosen to define hematuria results in a greater number of false positive test results (ie, no underlying abnormality is found). On the other hand, if higher cut-off values are chosen, it is more likely that the test will miss the presence of significant abnormalities.</p><p>The role of the urinalysis in distinguishing glomerular from nonglomerular bleeding is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Glomerular versus nonglomerular bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Urine dipstick</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urine sediment (or direct counting of RBC per mL of uncentrifuged urine) is the gold standard for the detection of microscopic hematuria (which is defined as 3 RBCs or more per high-power field). Dipsticks for heme detect 1 to 2 RBCs per high-power field and are therefore at least as, or more, sensitive as urine sediment examination, but they result in more false positive tests due to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Semen, which is present in the urine after ejaculation and may cause a positive heme reaction on the dipstick [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alkaline urine with a pH greater than 9 or contamination with oxidizing agents used to clean the perineum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of myoglobinuria or hemoglobinuria</p><p/><p>Thus, a positive dipstick test must always be confirmed with microscopic examination of the urine. Rarely, a very dilute urine produces osmotic lysis of almost all of the urinary RBCs, resulting in an apparently false positive test (because the dipstick detects hemoglobin but no RBCs are visible). This does not constitute a false positive test.</p><p>False negative tests with the urine dipstick are unusual; as a result, a negative dipstick usually excludes abnormal hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. False negative dipstick tests have been reported in patients ingesting large amounts of vitamin C; the clinical relevance of this observation is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematuria may be a symptom of an underlying disease, some of which are life threatening and some of which are treatable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63501 \">figure 1</a>). The causes vary with age, with the most common being inflammation or infection of the prostate or bladder, stones, and, in older patients, a kidney or urinary tract malignancy or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F61296\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61296 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/9,13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13-19</a>].</p><p>Rarely, hematuria is factitious, with blood added to an unwitnessed urine specimen after voiding (eg, from a finger stick) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Hematuria is common and frequently benign in young patients, and a cause is often not identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Transient or persistent hematuria'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Unexplained hematuria'</a> below.)</p><p>By contrast, even transient hematuria may be a symptom of an underlying serious condition, particularly in patients over age 35 years. (See <a href=\"#H3505610939\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1157623691\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall approach to the evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the evaluation of patients with a positive dipstick for heme or with red or brown urine is to confirm the presence of hematuria by microscopic analysis of a fresh, centrifuged specimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F107857\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107857 \">algorithm 1</a>). As noted above, hematuria is defined as 3 or more red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power field in a spun urine sediment. In patients with red or brown urine, the presence of hematuria can be confirmed if the sediment is red or brown after centrifugation of the specimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55923\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55923 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition of hematuria'</a> above.)</p><p>Microscopic hematuria identified in a woman during her menses, or in a patient shortly after vigorous exercise or acute trauma, should be confirmed by repeating the urinalysis. In menstruating women, the urinalysis should be repeated later in the cycle once menstrual bleeding has ceased. If this is not possible, a tampon can be inserted, and urinalysis can be obtained after the perineum is cleansed. In patients who had hematuria identified in the setting of vigorous exercise, the urinalysis should be repeated approximately four to six weeks later during a period of no exercise. Patients with acute trauma and microscopic hematuria should have a confirmatory urinalysis after six weeks.</p><p>Patients who present with hematuria and unilateral flank pain suggestive of obstructive nephrolithiasis should undergo imaging (noncontrast computed tomography [CT] or ultrasound with or without an abdominal radiograph) as the first test in the evaluation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic imaging'</a>). Historical features and signs or symptoms that provide clues to specific causes of hematuria are presented below (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Historical clues'</a> below). In other patients with hematuria, we take the following approach to the evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F107857\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107857 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have findings suggestive of urinary tract infection (eg, fever, dysuria, presence of white blood cells [WBCs] in the urine, positive dipstick for nitrite) should undergo urine culture to evaluate for urinary tract infection. In patients with urinary tract infection, the infection should be treated and the urinalysis should be repeated approximately six weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy in order to determine if the hematuria is persistent.

The cellular proliferation in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is associated with increased vascularity, and the new vessels can be fragile.

However, there is general agreement that the presence of BPH should not dissuade the clinician from pursuing further evaluation of hematuria, particularly since older men are more likely to have more serious disorders such as cancer of the prostate or bladder. Among those with gross hematuria in whom no other cause can be identified, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> usually suppresses the hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

This change in morphology is manifested by blebs, budding, and segmental loss of membrane, resulting in marked variability in RBC shape and a reduction in mean RBC size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79440%7ENEPH%2F62064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79440 graphicRef62064 \">picture 3B-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. RBC injury in this setting may be due both to mechanical trauma as the cells pass through rents in the glomerular basement membrane and to osmotic trauma as the cells flow through the nephron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The potential importance of RBC morphology was illustrated in a report in which isomorphic (or normomorphic) RBCs were seen in all 30 patients with nonglomerular bleeding but only 1 of 87 patients with proven glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A predominance of normal-shaped (and -sized) RBCs can occasionally be seen in patients with glomerulonephritis who undergo a forced diuresis or have advanced renal insufficiency or gross hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that the magnitude of dysmorphic hematuria is best expressed in absolute terms rather than as a percentage of urinary RBCs.

In particular, dysmorphic RBCs alone may be predictive of only renal bleeding, while acanthocytes (ring-shaped RBCs with vesicle-shaped protrusions that are best seen on phase-contrast microscopy) appear to be most predictive of glomerular disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79440%7ENEPH%2F62064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79440 graphicRef62064 \">picture 3B-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In one study, for example, the presence of acanthocytes comprising &ge;5 percent of excreted RBCs had a sensitivity and specificity for glomerular disease of 52 and 98 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Regardless of the absolute number or percentage, the presence of acanthocytes in the urine should lead the clinician to consider nephrology consultation rather than a lengthy urological evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1824471576\"><span class=\"h4\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major question regarding the utility of RBC morphology in determining the cause of hematuria is whether the findings in clinical studies can be replicated in clinical practice. Optimal assessment of RBC morphology requires phase-contrast microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], which is not generally available in a clinician's office and which requires experience in its use to gain proficiency.</p><p>The subjective nature of identifying &quot;dysmorphism&quot; is another potential limitation. Acanthocytes (also called G1 cells) may be easier to identify with certainty, even without phase-contrast microscopy. However, most clinicians do not have expertise in identifying dysmorphic RBCs or distinguishing RBC casts from RBCs overlying granular casts. In addition, the absence of these findings does not exclude glomerular disease. Proteinuria (and, more specifically, albuminuria) suggests the presence of glomerular disease and glomerular hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

However, a higher percentage of urine protein in the form of albumin is consistent with glomerular hematuria. One study, for example, found that a urine albumin-to-protein ratio of &ge;0.59 had a sensitivity of 97.1 percent for glomerular hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Thus, a high urine albumin-to-protein ratio can help to distinguish glomerular from nonglomerular hematuria.</p><p>The diagnostic importance of proteinuria varies with the <strong>time of onset</strong>. If, for example, the patient has previously identified proteinuria well before the onset of hematuria, then a separate disease may be responsible for the hematuria. As an example, if a patient with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria but no hematuria (eg, as in nephrosclerosis) develops new hematuria, it should not be assumed that the bleeding is due to the initial glomerular disease. Such patients should undergo a full evaluation for hematuria.

The urine is typically red to pink with nonglomerular bleeding. Although red urine also may be seen with glomerular bleeding (particularly in alkaline urine), the combination of prolonged transit time through the nephron and an acid urine pH may result in the formation of methemoglobin, which has a smoky brown or cola color.

Microhematuria alone does <strong>not</strong> typically lead to a significant increase in protein excretion. A dipstick test for protein that is greater than 1+ is rarely observed with nonglomerular bleeding, even with gross hematuria, unless the amount of gross blood is very large. As an example, as little as 1 mL of blood in one liter of urine can produce a visible color change. This quantity of blood contains approximately 0.6 mL of plasma, which will contain only 35 mg of protein at a plasma protein concentration of 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (60 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span>. A protein concentration of 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> is below the sensitivity of the urine dipstick for protein and therefore will not be detected on routine urine examination.

Images of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder are acquired at least twice, initially without intravenous contrast to evaluate for nephrolithiasis and hydronephrosis and then after intravenous contrast administration to evaluate for renal and urothelial abnormalities. This includes imaging in the excretory phase, typically acquired 7 to 10 minutes after the administration of the bolus of intravenous contrast. These delayed set of images are necessary for evaluation of the renal collecting systems and ureters. Other available modalities include intravenous pyelography (IVP); retrograde pyelography; ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder; and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis without and with intravenous contrast for urography, also called MR urography (MRU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Although CTU is the preferred initial imaging modality in almost all patients, there are some exceptions to this general recommendation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a young patient (eg, age &lt;35 years) with no risk factors for urinary tract malignancy, post-contrast images should not be routinely acquired if noncontrast images of the CTU unambiguously demonstrate nephrolithiasis.

In a study of 442 such patients, 64 had findings by CTU that could explain the hematuria; none were malignancy related, and all were identified on unenhanced imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder, not CTU, is the initial exam in the evaluation of pregnant women as this avoids ionizing radiation.

Instead, CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast is recommended. If this is negative for nephrolithiasis, MRU without contrast can be performed as this is more sensitive than noncontrast CT in detecting renal and urothelial tumors. Retrograde pyelography should be considered as an adjunct at cystoscopy to evaluate for ureteral abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with history of a mild acute reaction to iodinated contrast, CTU should be performed following precautionary measures. In patients with a history of a moderate or severe acute reaction, contrast administration should be avoided. The preferred exam in this setting depends upon the suspected etiology. CTU with noncontrast images only can be performed to evaluate for nephrolithiasis, but this would be relatively insensitive for detection of malignancy. MRU can be performed to evaluate for renal or urothelial tumor, but this would be insensitive for detection of nonobstructing stones.

The combination of CTU and cystoscopy, which together provide a complete evaluation of the urinary system, should be performed in almost all patients with unexplained hematuria. (See <a href=\"#H91125785\" class=\"local\">'Cystoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p>CTU combines the cross-sectional imaging of CT with an image acquisition protocol tailored to evaluate for nephrolithiasis and urothelial tumors. Although CTU protocols vary slightly with each site, in general, images of the kidney and the urinary collecting system are first obtained precontrast; after the administration of contrast, images are then obtained in the renal parenchymal phase and the excretory phase, either concurrently or successively. The noncontrast imaging evaluates for nephrolithiasis and hydronephrosis; the postcontrast imaging evaluates for renal and urothelial malignancy and, in the context of hydronephrosis, impaired function of the obstructed kidney. Thus, CTU provides anatomic and functional imaging of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.</p><p>CTU is more accurate than IVP or ultrasound for the diagnosis of renal masses, urinary tract calculi, and pelvicalyceal and ureteric transitional cell carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/52,54-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,54-63</a>].

In addition, postcontrast tomographic images of the kidneys are usually acquired. CTU has largely replaced IVP, which is less sensitive in detecting kidney stones and renal masses (particularly small masses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. The magnitude of this effect was illustrated in a study of 115 patients with hematuria in which CTU imaging was more sensitive (100 versus 61 percent) and specific (97 versus 91 percent) than an IVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Patients who have a negative evaluation for hematuria generally require follow-up with urinalysis, blood pressure monitoring, and, in some cases, repeat imaging and cystoscopy. The necessity for repeat imaging and cystoscopy largely depends upon whether hematuria was transient or persistent and upon the patient's risk for malignancy.

Such patients should be monitored with annual urinalyses. After two consecutive negative urinalyses, this follow-up may be concluded. If gross hematuria occurs at any time after the initial evaluation, the full evaluation should be repeated.</p><p>If hypertension, proteinuria, an increase in serum creatinine, or evidence of glomerular bleeding develops in a patient who has been evaluated for hematuria, the patient should be reevaluated for renal disease.

The combination of a negative computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis without and with contrast for urography (CTU), negative cytology, and negative cystoscopy is usually sufficient to exclude malignancy in the urinary tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the cause will subsequently become evident in some patients with careful follow-up. In a series of 421 patients with unexplained, asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who were followed at six-month intervals for more than one year, approximately 5 percent had an identifiable cause for hematuria within three years, and approximately 1 percent had a detectable urinary tract malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The most plausible argument for screening would be for the early detection and treatment of cancers of the kidney, collecting system, or bladder in older adults. However, these and other diseases causing hematuria do not meet basic criteria for screening: The prevalence of undetected, asymptomatic, early disease is relatively low (&lt;2 percent); there is little evidence that hematuria is a sensitive test for localized disease; and there is little evidence in patients with renal cancer that early treatment of local disease results in a better prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>Thus, expert groups such as the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on the periodic health examination do <strong>not</strong> recommend screening for hematuria.

In many such patients, particularly young adult patients under the age of 35 years, the hematuria is transient and of no consequence. Fever, infection, trauma, and exercise are potential causes of transient hematuria.

In patients with hematuria identified in the setting of vigorous exercise, the urinalysis should be repeated approximately four to six weeks later during a period of no exercise. Patients with acute trauma and microscopic hematuria should have a confirmatory urinalysis after four to six weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who present with unilateral flank pain suggestive of obstructive nephrolithiasis should undergo imaging (noncontrast computed tomography [CT] or ultrasound with or without an abdominal radiograph) as the first test in the evaluation (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic imaging'</a>.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who have findings suggestive of urinary tract infection (eg, fever, dysuria, presence of white blood cells [WBCs] in the urine, positive dipstick for nitrite) should undergo urine culture to evaluate for urinary tract infection.
