Doctors and nurses sometimes call it MRSA (which sounds like &quot;Mursa&quot;) for short.</p><p>People normally carry all sorts of germs inside their body and on their skin. The body usually controls these germs, so they do no harm. About 1 in 3 people have a germ on their skin called &quot;staph.&quot; In these people, staph usually causes no problems. But if they get a cut or a scrape, the germ can cause an infection.</p><p>A staph infection can be mild, and affect only the skin. But if the infection goes deeper into the body, it can be very serious. These more serious infections tend to happen in young children, older adults, and people who cannot fight infection well.</p><p>Methicillin, a type of penicillin, is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by staph. But MRSA is an especially dangerous type of staph that has learned to outsmart methicillin so the medicine does not work. Doctors call this &quot;resistance.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482789296\"><span class=\"h1\">How do you catch MRSA?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people carry MRSA on their skin without knowing it. This is called being &quot;colonized.&quot; You can pick up the germ by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touching a person who has MRSA on his or her skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being nearby when a person with MRSA breathes, coughs, or sneezes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touching a table, handle, or other surface that has the germ on it</p><p/><p>If the germ is on your skin and you cut yourself or have another injury, you can get infected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482789303\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I have a MRSA infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you get a MRSA infection, you will probably have some skin problems. You might have a red, tender lump, and it might ooze pus. Or you might have a cluster of bumps that look like pimples or insect bites. If the infection gets into the blood, it can give you a fever or make you feel tired.</p><p>If your doctor thinks you have MRSA, he or she can take a swab from your skin and check it for germs. In some cases, blood tests, X-rays, and other tests might be needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482789310\"><span class=\"h1\">Can MRSA be treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor can give you special antibiotics (germ-killing medicines) to treat your infection. If you get treated with medicines to take at home, it is very important that you follow the directions exactly. Take <strong>all</strong> the pills you are given, even if you feel better before you finish the pills. If you do not take them all, the germ could come back even stronger.</p><p>If you do not get better with the medicines that come in pill form, or if you are very sick, your doctor might put you in the hospital. There he or she can give you stronger medicines through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p>If you are colonized with MRSA but don't have an infection, your doctor will decide whether you should get treatment. Most people who are otherwise healthy don't need it, but some do.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482789317\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there any way to prevent MRSA?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People everywhere should wash their hands often with soap and water. This is the best way to prevent most infections. It is especially important for people who are in the hospital or a nursing home.</p><p>If you are a patient in a hospital, you should also make sure your doctors and nurses wash their hands before they touch you. If there is no sink, they can use an alcohol-based hand gel instead.</p><p>If you are already colonized with MRSA, your doctors and nurses will wear special hospital gowns and gloves when they are in your room. This is to prevent passing the MRSA on to other patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482789324\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospital-acquired-pneumonia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hospital-acquired pneumonia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
