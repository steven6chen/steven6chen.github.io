Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in older adults, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of cases. Asymptomatic individuals often present with concerns about developing dementia, especially when they have a family history.</p><p>Two major reports released in 2017 review the literature on potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia and highlight strengths and weaknesses in the available data to support the impact of risk factor modification on dementia incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. While the overall evidence is generally of low quality and does not support any single intervention as effective in delaying or preventing dementia, there is optimism that intensive risk factor modification, especially during midlife (age 45 to 65 years), has the potential to delay or prevent a substantial number of dementia cases worldwide. In support of this, large population-based studies indicate that the incidence of dementia has declined in high-income countries over the last several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>].</p><p>Related material concerning risk factors for dementia is discussed separately. The risk factors, treatment, and prevention of vascular dementia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-alzheimer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vascular-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of vascular dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of vascular dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2831934305\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFESTYLE AND ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on epidemiologic evidence and biologic plausibility regarding the relationship between a healthy lifestyle and dementia risk (as well as other health benefits), we encourage patients to maintain or increase physical activity, exercise, cognitive leisure activities, and social interaction. </p><p>Observational evidence supports an inverse association between various components of a healthy lifestyle (eg, social interaction, education and mental activities, physical exercise) and the incidence of dementia, even after adjusting for relevant confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/9-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-31</a>]. However, it is not known whether these interventions effectively reduce dementia risk, and most trials have looked at relatively short-term interventions and outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2676444179\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although numerous observational studies have found an inverse association between physical exercise and risk of dementia, the protective effects of exercise remain unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/2,32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32-35</a>]. It remains possible that physical exercise has synergistic benefits as part of a more comprehensive risk factor reduction strategy. (See <a href=\"#H2568833716\" class=\"local\">'Vascular risk factor modification'</a> below.)</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials, aerobic exercise in healthy older adults did not improve cognitive outcomes in any domain, even in trials in which cardiorespiratory fitness improved in the exercise group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The duration of the trials ranged from two to six months. Two trials of more prolonged and intensive lifestyle interventions in sedentary older adults and adults with type 2 diabetes also found no improvement in cognitive function or rates of cognitive decline and dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Some have posited that exercise in early and middle adulthood may have greater chance of influencing dementia risk than exercise in late adulthood. In particular, midlife levels of cardiorespiratory fitness may predict risk of dementia later in life, independent of cerebrovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, a prospective cohort study that began following exercise levels in healthy adults between 35 and 55 years of age failed to find a protective effect of exercise over nearly 30 years of follow up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In patients diagnosed with dementia, exercise levels began to decline up to nine years before diagnosis, suggesting that reverse causation may partially explain previous observations that exercise is associated with a lower risk of dementia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4218671343\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various cognitive interventions including memory training, the use of external memory cues, and organizational aids have shown positive short-term effects on cognition in healthy older adults, but the long-term impacts are less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/2,40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,40-44</a>]. Examples of the largest individual trials include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ACTIVE trial randomly assigned 2832 older adults to one of three cognitive interventions or a control group, and found that a 10-week training program in inductive reasoning (but not in verbal memory or speed of processing) resulted in improved performance on the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living that was sustained at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The rate of incident dementia at five years was unaffected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and longer-term follow up of the cohort is still in progress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FINGER trial tested a multidomain intervention that included diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk monitoring in 1260 at-risk elderly adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Compared with controls who were given general health advice, individuals who were randomly assigned to the intervention showed greater improvements in neuropsychological test battery scores at two years. The magnitude of benefit was relatively small, however, and longer follow up is needed to determine whether the intervention has any impact on rates of cognitive decline or dementia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) tested a multidomain intervention of physical activity, cognitive training, and nutritional advice with or without omega-3 fatty acid supplementation versus placebo in 1525 older adults with subjective memory complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. At three years, there were no differences in cognitive test scores among the groups.</p><p/><p>At present, there is no evidence to support the notion that computerized &quot;brain training&quot; programs marketed commercially, most of which are not as intensive as the intervention in the ACTIVE trial, have benefits beyond short-term gains in the specific cognitive tasks that are being rehearsed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H852233329\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of education and cognitive reserve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Higher levels of education have been associated with a reduced risk of dementia, or at least a later onset of symptoms relative to neuropathologic disease burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>]. Advanced education is believed to represent a higher cognitive reserve that decreases the impact of degenerative pathology on cognitive function, rather than providing a protective effect against the accumulation of amyloid or other pathologic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/49,52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,52-55</a>]. </p><p>Once clinical dementia develops, however, patients with higher education or occupational levels appear to experience a somewhat more rapid cognitive decline, at least in part because they are assumed to have accumulated a greater degree of Alzheimer pathology by the time dementia is apparent, compared with those with less education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2568833716\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR RISK FACTOR MODIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An analysis based upon the observed prevalence of potentially modifiable risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, inactivity) combined with their associated relative risk for dementia suggests that risk factor reductions of 10 to 25 percent may prevent up to half of Alzheimer disease (AD) cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Although population-based data are not entirely consistent, it does appear that the incidence of all-cause dementia, and especially vascular dementia, is declining in high-income countries over the past several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. This trend has occurred as the prevalence of many vascular risk factors has also decreased over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While evidence is still lacking to support the routine use of any of these measures for the specific indication of preventing AD or dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>], epidemiologic studies offer optimism that multimodality risk factor reduction is worthwhile, not just for cardiovascular outcomes but also for cognitive health.</p><p>Vascular risk factor management as it relates to dementia prevention is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-vascular-dementia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of vascular dementia&quot;, section on 'Risk factor management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727955342\"><span class=\"h2\">Antihypertensive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension appears to be associated with an increased risk of both vascular dementia and AD, but the effect of antihypertensive treatment on reducing risk is uncertain and may be most important in midlife [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. One analysis estimated that based upon the prevalence of hypertension and the relative risk for dementia, lowering the prevalence of hypertension by 25 percent could reduce the incidence of AD by nearly 100,000 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia&quot;, section on 'Hypertension'</a>.)</p><p>Until more data are available, firm conclusions regarding antihypertensive treatment for prevention of dementia or cognitive impairment cannot be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/2,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,63,64</a>]. However, there are enough other reasons to treat patients with hypertension that the prevention of dementia alone is unlikely to influence therapeutic decisions. A consensus-based scientific review by the American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Stroke Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ASA)</span> concluded that blood pressure lowering to lower the risk of post-stroke dementia is effective and that it is reasonable to lower blood pressure in mid-life to lower the risk of late-life dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The review cautions that less is known about the effects of blood pressure lowering among those older than 80 years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Although observational studies suggest that antihypertensive therapy is associated with a decreased risk of cognitive decline and dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], randomized trials have yielded mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/63,66-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,66-75</a>]. Some of this discrepancy may be explained by the length of follow-up in these trials (ranging from two to five years) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the type of antihypertensive therapy used. Also, some trials had significant loss to follow-up <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> had a number of patients allocated to placebo who were on active treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. </p><p>A meta-analysis that included nine randomized trials and 55,325 participants with hypertension found that blood pressure lowering therapy did not reduce the risk of dementia (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.95, p = 0.24; absolute risk 4.0 versus 4.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. A subsequent randomized trial in 1439 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus found no benefit of intensive blood pressure control (goal systolic blood pressure 120 mmHg) versus standard blood pressure control (goal 140 mmHg) on cognitive outcomes at 40 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In a subset of patients who underwent baseline and follow up brain MRIs, intensive control was associated with an increased decline in total brain volume compared with standard control, raising some concern about aggressive lowering at least in this subset of patients with increased cardiovascular risk.</p><p>Low quality data do not support an advantage of one antihypertensive agent over another, and some of the evidence is conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/72,78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,78,79</a>]. A network meta-analysis of randomized and observational studies in patients without prior cerebrovascular disorders found that angiotensin receptor blockers had greater positive effects on cognition than did other classes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The effect size was small, however, and no benefit was seen with longer treatment duration (ie, greater than six months). In contrast, when trials of diuretics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcium channel blockers <span class=\"nowrap\">(DIU/CCB)</span> were considered separately from ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocking drugs <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACE/ARB)</span> in a 2011 meta-analysis, there was a small but statistically significant reduction in dementia risk for <span class=\"nowrap\">DIU/CCB</span> versus placebo (OR 0.88, p = 0.02; absolute risk difference 0.4 percent) but not <span class=\"nowrap\">ACE/ARB</span> (OR 1.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3668653990\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTIONS WITH UNPROVEN BENEFIT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary modifications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While many aspects of a healthy diet have been observed to correlate with positive health outcomes, including cognitive health and freedom from dementia, the evidence is insufficient to conclude that specific diets or dietary supplements reduce the risk of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/1,2,60,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,60,80</a>]. Omega-3 fatty acids (via fish consumption or dietary supplementation) and a Mediterranean style diet are among the most studied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30662690\"><span class=\"h3\">Omega-3 fatty acids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fish oil consumption through dietary intake of fish or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation influences several cardiovascular risk factors and may reduce the risk of death from coronary heart disease.

Many longitudinal cohort studies have shown an association between higher fish oil consumption and reduced risk of dementia, cognitive decline, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> accumulation of white matter abnormalities on brain MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/83-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-88</a>], with some exceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>]. Other studies have suggested that the benefit may vary according to apolipoprotein E (<em>APOE</em>) genotype, with epsilon 4 carriers deriving more benefit from fish consumption than non-carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-93</a>]. </p><p>However, randomized trials to date have not shown a benefit to cognitive function and have lacked power and duration to test whether consumption reduces incident dementia. A meta-analysis of three trials that studied the impact of omega-3 supplementation on cognitive performance found no effect of treatment after 6 to 40 months of supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Subsequent to this review, other trials have also found no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/46,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,95</a>], including a trial in 4203 older adults at risk for macular degeneration that found no effect of fish oil supplementation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lutein on composite cognitive function scores over a five-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Mediterranean diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no single Mediterranean diet, but such diets are typically high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds and include olive oil as an important source of fat.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=healthy-diet-in-adults#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Healthy diet in adults&quot;, section on 'Mediterranean diet'</a>.) </p><p>Observational studies using dietary questionnaires to assess and quantify adherence to the diet in different population cohorts have found that patients who were most adherent to the diet had a lower incidence of mild cognitive impairment and AD and slower rates of cognitive decline compared with those who did not follow this diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/9,96-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,96-101</a>]. </p><p>Similar benefits have been reported for those who are adherent to a modified Mediterranean diet that places particular emphasis on natural plant-based foods, berries, and leafy green vegetables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. These studies are subject to the same limitations discussed above regarding confounding from economic and educational factors. In addition, the use of questionnaires to assess diet may be problematic given that individuals at risk for AD may have baseline mild cognitive impairment.</p><p>Nonetheless, multiple cohort studies and one large randomized trial (PREDIMED) have suggested that adherence to a Mediterranean diet improves cardiovascular outcomes, including stroke, and these effects may directly or indirectly promote lower dementia risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104</a>]. In addition, a post-hoc subset analysis of the PREDIMED trial found that cognitive test scores were improved in patients assigned to the Mediterranean diet compared with controls among those who completed both baseline and end-of-study testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-dementia/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].
