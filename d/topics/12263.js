Some are lifesaving therapies, such as anticancer drugs and radiation therapy. Others include cigarette smoke, viruses, and radioactivity (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure#H79731003\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and causes of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;, section on 'Ovarian toxins'</a>). Anticancer drugs and radiation therapy are the most common of the known ovarian toxins. It is estimated that up to 1 in 1000 persons under age 20 years will have been cured of cancer by these treatments by the year 2000, and many of them will have forgotten their treatment by the time they seek care for reproductive dysfunction. As an example, in a survey of 1928 adult survivors of childhood cancer, 14 percent denied having had cancer and 18 percent misclassified their treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Ovarian failure due to anticancer drugs and radiation will be reviewed here. Other causes of premature ovarian failure, an overview of fertility in cancer survivors, and options for fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic therapy are discussed elsewhere.

However, the effect of these drugs on ovarian function varies widely, some having no effect and others causing permanent hypogonadism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58142\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58142 \">table 1</a>). Typically, the ovaries of women who received chemotherapy have normal to mildly decreased numbers of primordial follicles and a greater decrease in the numbers of larger maturing follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], indicating a greater effect on follicular development than on oocytes.</p><p>Consistent with these histology findings are the clinical observations that many women, especially under 40 years of age, develop amenorrhea during chemotherapy, often with high serum gonadotropin concentrations, but menstrual function and, in some cases, fertility may return several months to years after the cessation of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H465437487\"><span class=\"h2\">Individual agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alkylating drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, are the best documented and most potent at inducing ovarian failure. They alter base pairs, leading to DNA cross-links, and introduce single-strand DNA breaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As a result, they can theoretically affect both resting cells, such as oocytes, and dividing cells. The effects are age, dose, and drug dependent. Younger women are affected less often than older women, presumably because they have more remaining oocytes. In one study, as an example, all women over age 40 years had amenorrhea after receiving more than 5.2 g of cyclophosphamide, whereas the dose required to cause amenorrhea in younger women was 9.5 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H465437493\"><span class=\"h3\">Variable susceptibility to ovarian dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>However, there is considerable variation in susceptibility, with some women having normal ovarian function but others of the same age having permanent primary hypogonadism after high doses of a single drug.

Serum concentrations of AMH decline rapidly during chemotherapy and may be useful for evaluating the ovarian toxicity of chemotherapy regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. However, its clinical use is not well established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;, section on 'Anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH)'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H465437511\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple drug regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with cancer are treated with multiple drugs, so it is easier to evaluate the consequences of specific treatments rather than single drugs. In addition, standard treatment regimens changed over time. For example, MOPP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechlorethamine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mechlorethamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>), an early standard regimen used for Hodgkin lymphoma, induced <strong>permanent</strong> primary hypogonadism in 12 to 46 percent of women treated, and the onset of amenorrhea was more rapid and its incidence was higher in those over age 24 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/2,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,13</a>]. The wide range of primary hypogonadism is related, in part, to different definitions and duration of amenorrhea used in individual studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-side-effects-of-adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-early-stage-breast-cancer#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute side effects of adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea'</a>.)</p><p>Currently used regimens for Hodgkin lymphoma have variable reproductive toxicities. The combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a> (ABVD) is the preferred therapy for most Hodgkin lymphoma patients, and it is associated with a low incidence of chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure. In contrast, with BEACOPP (bleomycin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, doxorubicin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) or escalated BEACOPP, approximately 50 percent of women develop ovarian failure that is not prevented by use of oral contraceptives or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced (stage III-IV) classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In women with early-stage breast cancer, two commonly used adjuvant chemotherapy regimens are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF), and anthracycline-based regimens, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> plus cyclophosphamide (AC). In one study, the risk of ovarian failure appeared to be greater with CMF when compared with AC regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The risk of ovarian failure with different adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for early breast cancer is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-side-effects-of-adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-early-stage-breast-cancer#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute side effects of adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea'</a>.)</p><p>The results in girls and young women treated with regimens specific for leukemia and solid tumors are different. In a study of 35 pre- and postpubertal girls with leukemia who received various treatments, only three had primary hypogonadism a mean of 49 months after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; one had many residual follicles on ovarian biopsy and the other two resumed menses 8 and 14 months later, suggesting they had a disorder of granulosa cell responsiveness rather than oocyte depletion. Girls with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> (ara-C), and other drugs and cranial irradiation have a slightly early onset of puberty but high serum FSH and low inhibin concentrations, again suggestive of granulosa and thecal cell damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Although it would be ideal to modify chemotherapy regimens to minimize the negative effect on ovarian function, the primary focus of chemotherapy treatment in these situations is to maximize the probability of cure. The primary approaches to dealing with the ovarian complications of chemotherapy have included suppression of ovarian function and alternative fertility options, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Fertility preservation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment or gonadal resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIATION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy is more damaging to ovarian tissue than chemotherapy. Its effects also are dose- and age-dependent, but unlike chemotherapy, radiation is particularly toxic to oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In younger women, radiation can cause transient amenorrhea that resolves after 6 to 18 months, presumably after recruitment and development of a new cohort of primary follicles. Such a response has also been documented in women receiving radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer, in whom approximately 30 percent had reversible primary hypogonadism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Radioiodine treatment&quot;, section on 'Gonadal function and fertility'</a>.)</p><p>Although doses of more than 600 rads (6 Gy) consistently cause permanent primary hypogonadism in women over age 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], the impact of lower doses varies, with reports of conceptions in women under 20 years of age who received up to 3000 rads (30 Gy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Treatment of women with Hodgkin lymphoma with pelvic irradiation in addition to chemotherapy increased the risk of ovarian failure from 0 to 68 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>One study estimated the radiosensitivity of the oocyte to be &lt;2 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Based upon this estimate, the authors calculated the dose of radiotherapy that would result in immediate and permanent ovarian failure in 97.5 percent of patients as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>20.3 Gy at birth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>18.4 Gy at age 10 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>16.5 Gy at age 20 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>14.3 Gy at age 30 years</p><p/><p>Although these estimates have not been confirmed in other studies, they may be useful for counseling patients and families prior to initiating radiation therapy.</p><p>It is important to note that most young women who are going to receive pelvic radiation therapy typically have an attempt to move the ovaries outside the field of radiation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Oophoropexy'</a> below.)</p><p>There is no evidence for an increased rate of congenital anomalies in the offspring of women treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There may, however, be an increase in the rate of early pregnancy loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and small for gestational age infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and an increased risk of malformations in fetuses exposed to radiation in utero.

In a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) of 2819 survivors of childhood cancer over age 18 years and a control group of 1065 female siblings of participants in the CCSS, the cumulative incidence of premature ovarian failure in the survivor group was 8 percent compared with 0.8 percent in the siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. One study estimates the rate at 10.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Significant risk factors for nonsurgical premature menopause included older age at diagnosis, exposure to increasing doses of radiation to the ovaries (&ge;1000 cGy ovarian irradiation), increasing alkylating agent score (based on number of alkylating agents and cumulative dose), and a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma. The cumulative incidence of nonsurgical premature menopause was approximately 30 percent in survivors who had been treated with both alkylating agents and abdominopelvic radiation.

This can be reversibly achieved by the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or oral contraceptives. In animals, GnRH agonists reduce the risk of chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage. The evidence in humans of a benefit from such an approach has been limited. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials suggest that addition of a GnRH agonist may be beneficial for protection of menstrual function, but there is no evidence to date that GnRH agonist co-treatment improves the rate of spontaneous pregnancy after chemotherapy. Other trials may determine the fertility outcome.
