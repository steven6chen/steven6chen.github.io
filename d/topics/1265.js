In the United States, gallstones are seen in approximately 6 percent of men and 9 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most individuals with gallstones are asymptomatic throughout their life and are referred to as having &quot;incidental&quot; gallstones. &quot;Uncomplicated&quot; gallstone disease is present if the gallstones cause symptoms (eg, biliary colic). Patients with gallstones, particularly those with uncomplicated gallstone disease, are at risk of developing complications such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or gallstone pancreatitis.</p><p>This topic will review the approach to the patient with incidental gallstones. The epidemiology and risk factors for gallstone disease and the approach to patients with symptomatic gallstones or with complications of gallstone disease (such as cholecystitis and pancreatitis) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for gallstones&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholecystitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choledocholithiasis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of acute pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Gallstones'</a>.)</p><p>The discussion that follows is generally consistent with <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6241?etoc=&amp;token=pvjxet6noCjROA9KC807zb4M/btqvZaeIbnP3JAdP4sTJAvqSdrP6ICy2ealV9lX1szpeJ3FcTE+NFzJQS36mg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=673\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guidelines</a> from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic data on the prevalence of gallstones are available from studies of European, American, and Asian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. These studies have revealed a marked variation in overall gallstone prevalence between different ethnic populations. As a general rule, the prevalence of gallstones is higher in Western Caucasian, Hispanic, and Native American populations than in Eastern European, African American, and Asian populations. Some risk factors for gallstones include female sex, older age, and pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81139\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81139 \">table 1</a>). The epidemiology and risk factors for gallstones are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for gallstones&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161025\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the majority of patients with incidental gallstones will not develop symptoms attributable to the gallstones, approximately 15 to 25 percent will become symptomatic during up to 10 to 15 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Patients who develop symptoms typically report biliary colic rather than symptoms associated with the complications of gallstone disease (such as cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and choledocholithiasis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The classic description of biliary colic is of an intense, dull discomfort located in the right upper quadrant, epigastrium, or (less often) substernal area that may radiate to the back (particularly the right shoulder blade) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Despite its name, the pain is usually steady and not colicky. The pain is often associated with diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. It is not exacerbated by movement and is not relieved by squatting, bowel movements, or passage of flatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The pain typically lasts at least 30 minutes, plateauing within an hour. The pain then starts to subside, with an entire attack usually lasting less than six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults#H8995491\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Biliary colic'</a>.)</p><p>Once a patient develops symptoms, the symptoms are likely to recur and the patient is at increased risk for the development of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In an illustrative study that included 305 patients with gallstones, 70 percent of those with a history of biliary colic developed recurrent symptoms within two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other complications of gallstone disease occur at a rate of approximately 1 to 2 percent per year in most studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1158799\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, incidental gallstones are asymptomatic. Incidental gallstones are identified when imaging studies are obtained for other reasons (eg, as part of the evaluation of abdominal pain, pelvic disease, and abnormal liver blood tests). If symptoms related to the gallstones develop, the patient has uncomplicated gallstone disease rather than incidental gallstones. (See <a href=\"#H1161025\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p>Gallstones are sometimes implicated as the source of symptoms in patients with dyspepsia. However, such an association should be made cautiously since gallstones may silently coexist in patients with dyspepsia, and other causes of dyspepsia are more common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with dyspepsia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On ultrasound, gallstones appear as echogenic foci that cast an acoustic shadow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70175\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70175 \">image 1</a>) and seek gravitational dependency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. &quot;Gravel&quot; is the appearance of multiple small stones that are echogenic and cast shadows. Patients with microlithiasis may have the ultrasonographic finding of &quot;sludge.&quot; Sludge is echogenic in appearance but does not cast an acoustic shadow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F88946\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88946 \">image 2</a>). It is also more viscous than gravel and does not move to the dependent portion of the gallbladder as rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Gallstones are rarely seen on plain abdominal radiographs because only approximately 10 percent of gallstones contain enough calcium to make them sufficiently radio-opaque to be visible on a plain radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71203\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71203 \">image 3</a>). Gallstones may be seen with abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning though they can be missed because many stones are isodense with bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. </p><p>Occasionally, gallstones will contain foci of air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. On CT, the stones may demonstrate what has been called a &quot;bird's food sign.&quot; Air within gallstones is a benign finding but is important to recognize since it may be mistakenly confused with emphysematous cholecystitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic cholecystectomy is <strong>not</strong> indicated for most patients with asymptomatic gallstones. Patients can typically be managed expectantly and referred for cholecystectomy if symptoms subsequently develop. However, cholecystectomy is indicated for patients at increased risk for gallbladder cancer and may be appropriate for some patients with hemolytic disorders or those who are undergoing gastric bypass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1160252\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> below.) <span class=\"utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys\">(Related Pathway(s): <a href=\"/icg/108283?topicRef=673&amp;source=see_link\" target=\"_blank\">Gallstones: Management of an adult with gallstones (symptomatic or asymptomatic)</a>.)</span></p><p>There are no prospective trials of surgical or medical therapy for asymptomatic gallstones. However, decision analysis models have shown no benefit with prophylactic cholecystectomy. In one decision analysis, prophylactic cholecystectomy slightly decreased survival and was not associated with an appreciable gain in discounted life-years gained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although the model was constructed prior to the development of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, it is unlikely that the laparoscopic approach would significantly alter the results based upon the results of the sensitivity analysis included in the study.</p><p>Patients with diabetes mellitus may be at increased risk for the development of severe gangrenous cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, the magnitude of the risk and the risks and costs of cholecystectomy do not warrant prophylactic cholecystectomy in patients with asymptomatic gallstones. One study, for example, identified 70 patients with gallstones and diabetes mellitus who were followed for five years; 47 (70 percent) were asymptomatic at study entry, while the others had a history of biliary colic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. During follow-up, 10 percent of the initially asymptomatic patients developed biliary colic and 4 percent developed other gallstone complications; these values are similar to the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. By contrast, 48 percent of patients who were initially symptomatic either continued to have biliary colic (40 percent) or developed acute cholecystitis (8 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1160252\"><span class=\"h2\">Special populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic cholecystectomy is indicated for patients with an increased risk of gallbladder cancer and may have a role in the treatment of some patients with hemolytic disorders or those who are undergoing a gastric bypass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1160584\"><span class=\"h3\">Increased risk of gallbladder cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholecystectomy is indicated for patients at increased risk for gallbladder cancer, provided they are good surgical candidates.

Because of this, we suggest cholecystectomy for patients with sickle cell disease if abdominal surgery is being performed for other reasons. Some authorities recommend combined prophylactic splenectomy and cholecystectomy in young asymptomatic patients with hereditary spherocytosis if gallstones are present. Our approach is to perform a cholecystectomy if the patient has gallstones and a splenectomy is being performed as part of the treatment for hereditary spherocytosis.
