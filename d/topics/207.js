The diagnosis of acute AC joint injury (sometimes referred to as a sprain or &quot;separated&quot; shoulder) is often straightforward due to the presence of focal tenderness, swelling, and deformity.</p><p>AC joint disorders from overuse, inflammation, or chronic degeneration can be more difficult to diagnose, particularly if concomitant shoulder problems exist. This topic will review the evaluation and management of AC joint disorders. AC joint injuries are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acromioclavicular-joint-injuries-separated-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acromioclavicular joint injuries (&quot;separated&quot; shoulder)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685298\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acromioclavicular (AC) joint unites the distal clavicle and the acromion of the scapula. It contains an intra-articular disc, a synovial membrane, and articular cartilage that cover the distal end of the clavicle and the opposing surface of the acromion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The AC joint is supported by a ligament complex, as well as surrounding fascia and muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62016\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62016 \">picture 1</a>). The anatomy and biomechanics of the AC joint are described in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acromioclavicular-joint-injuries-separated-shoulder#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acromioclavicular joint injuries (&quot;separated&quot; shoulder)&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and biomechanics'</a>.)</p><p>The AC joint normally degenerates over several decades but in most cases, remains asymptomatic. The joint gradually narrows as the articular disc and chondral cartilage wear away. This degeneration is often more rapid than in other joints, with the articular disc beginning to break down in the second decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. By the age of 40, most patients have narrowing of the joint space and possibly other degenerative findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685305\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF THE PAINFUL AC JOINT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with a painful acromioclavicular (AC) joint often complains of focal shoulder pain, and when asked to point to the most painful spot typically indicates the top of the shoulder. However, pain arising from the AC joint may be more generalized since the joint is innervated by branches of both the axillary and lateral pectoral nerves. Symptoms arising from the AC joint may be felt anywhere from the base of the neck and trapezius region to the lateral deltoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Note that patients with symptoms in the region of the AC joint may have other shoulder conditions or pain referred from the cervical spine, chest, or abdomen. Extraneous sources of pain are listed in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55507 \">table 1</a>). A general approach to shoulder pain is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685312\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When evaluating a patient for a possible AC joint disorder, inquire about the onset, duration, quality, and pattern (eg, worse at night) of any discomfort. The patient may describe the classic pattern of pain at the top of the shoulder when their arms are outstretched or moved across their body (eg, reaching for a seat-belt shoulder strap). The pain may be vague, sharp, or grinding, and may awaken the patient at night when he or she rolls onto the affected shoulder. Some patients may try to alleviate their discomfort by avoiding moving their arms across their body.</p><p>Inquire about any past or recent trauma. Falls onto the point of the shoulder often lead to AC injury, which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acromioclavicular-joint-injuries-separated-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acromioclavicular joint injuries (&quot;separated&quot; shoulder)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Perform a review of symptoms for cervical spine, cardiac, lung, chest wall, or abdominal problems, as well as any symptoms of infection or inflammation around the shoulder. A personal or family history of inflammatory arthritis may be relevant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685319\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the history and location of symptoms may suggest that the AC joint is the most likely source of pain, the clinician must also consider disorders in other parts of the shoulder and elsewhere (eg, pain radiating from the neck). Thus, a complete shoulder examination should be performed, as rotator cuff pathology may mimic or refer symptoms to the AC joint. A systematic approach to the patient with shoulder pain and a more detailed discussion of the shoulder examination are provided separately. Aspects of the examination of particular relevance to AC joint disorders are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685326\"><span class=\"h3\">Inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observe the AC joint for asymmetry, enlargement, and deformity. Note any swelling, rash, erythema, or atrophy. For a proper examination, both shoulders should be completely exposed. Obvious asymmetric bony deformity suggests an AC joint separation or clavicle fracture. Soft tissue swelling directly over the AC joint may represent the &quot;geyser sign,&quot; suggesting a cyst arising from the AC joint that develops following a massive rotator cuff tear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acromioclavicular-joint-injuries-separated-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acromioclavicular joint injuries (&quot;separated&quot; shoulder)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clavicle-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clavicle fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685333\"><span class=\"h3\">Palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful palpation of the AC joint, particularly along its superior aspect, can help identify the source of pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62599\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62599 \">picture 2</a>). Direct palpation that elicits focal tenderness at the joint is a sensitive but nonspecific finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Therefore, an AC joint that is <strong>not</strong> tender to palpation is unlikely to be the source of pain. Conversely, focal tenderness at the AC joint may be due to pathology within the joint itself or surrounding structures. If an appropriate examination reveals an absence of tenderness or other suggestive clinical findings at other sites at and around the shoulder, AC joint pathology is the likely cause of pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685340\"><span class=\"h3\">Shoulder range of motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assess shoulder range of motion. The patient with a painful AC joint may exhibit limitations in shoulder flexion, cross body adduction, and internal rotation. The patient may be able to reproduce their pain by actively reaching across to put their hand on the opposite shoulder. Include active adduction in the range of motion evaluation of any patient with possible AC joint symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685347\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurovascular function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A screening neurovascular examination of the involved upper extremity should be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685354\"><span class=\"h3\">Special maneuvers for the AC joint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many tests for differentiating among painful conditions of the shoulder have been described, but few have been rigorously assessed and of these few have demonstrated diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A systematic review of studies of shoulder examination techniques found only three studies that looked specifically at techniques to assess the AC joint, and no technique demonstrated sufficient accuracy to make a diagnosis independent of other data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. These findings reinforce the importance of taking a careful history and then integrating examination findings and the results of imaging studies when developing a diagnosis. In some cases, a diagnostic injection may be needed.</p><p>The provocative tests described below, and evaluated in the three studies alluded to above, provide some help when trying to determine whether an AC disorder is responsible for a patient's symptoms. There is limited data on the diagnostic accuracy of combining these tests. We generally make an initial diagnosis based upon a suggestive history combined with focal tenderness at the AC joint and positive provocative maneuvers. The patient's response to treatment, the absence of clear alternative diagnoses, and serial evaluations are used to confirm the initial diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2500021\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685361\"><span class=\"h4\">Cross body adduction test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To perform the test, the examiner holds the patient's involved arm with the elbow fully extended (straight arm), lifts it to 90 degrees of shoulder flexion while maintaining neutral rotation, and then passively adducts it across the patient's body, thereby compressing the AC joint of the involved arm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55432\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55432 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>Data are limited on the accuracy of this test. In a retrospective study of 35 patients with painful AC joint lesions that were subsequently confirmed surgically, compression of the AC joint by adducting the patient's arm across their body was 77 percent sensitive and 79 percent specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example of the relatively low specificity, patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy may also complain of pain from cross body adduction, particularly if the arm is internally rotated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69286\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69286 \">picture 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685368\"><span class=\"h4\">AC shear testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shear force can be applied to the AC joint by simultaneously pushing the scapula from a posterior direction and the clavicle from an anterior direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58057\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58057 \">picture 5</a>). A one-handed shear test is referred to as the Paxinos test. In this test, the examiner places the thumb on the posterior acromion and fingers on the mid clavicle and tries to squeeze the thumb and fingers together (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69834\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69834 \">picture 6</a>). In a prospective observational study of 38 patients who mapped pain within an area bounded by the midpart of the clavicle and the deltoid insertion, the Paxinos text was 79 percent sensitive but nonspecific for pain originating in the AC joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685375\"><span class=\"h4\">Active compression test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The active compression test is performed in two parts. The first part consists of holding the patient's affected arm in 90 degrees of shoulder flexion with the elbow fully extended, adducting the arm 10 to 15 degrees, and then internally rotating the arm so the thumb points to the ground. While the patient maintains their arm in this position, the examiner pushes down on the arm while the patient resists (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82019\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82019 \">picture 7</a>). In the second part of the test, the patient maintains the same position but now supinates the arm (palm up position). Then the examiner again pushes down on the arm while the patient resists (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58296\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58296 \">picture 8</a>). If the test causes pain atop the shoulder, this suggests a disorder of the AC joint; if the test elicits pain or a painful &quot;click&quot; inside the shoulder (glenohumeral joint), this suggests labral pathology.</p><p>The efficacy of the active compression test was evaluated in a prospective observational study in which 55 of 62 patients (89 percent) with a positive test preoperatively had AC joint pathology at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There were no false negative results. High specificity (95 percent) was also noted in the retrospective series of 35 patients cited above, but the sensitivity was only 41 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17375993\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic imaging</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685382\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs of the AC joint are often abnormal in the adult due to the joint's relatively rapid, natural degeneration. (See <a href=\"#H9685298\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>A standard shoulder series (anteroposterior (AP) shoulder, AP glenoid, and scapular Y views) may provide adequate information, but an axillary and Zanca view may be needed. The Zanca view is an AP radiograph of the shoulder with 15 to 30 degrees of cephalic tilt such that the image of the AC joint appears above the acromion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72101\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72101 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82477\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82477 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The shoulder may need to be abducted to obtain the proper position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685396\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A three-phase bone scan can help identify an AC joint disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The presence of increased metabolic bone activity increases the likelihood of an actively painful joint. According to one small prospective observational study, the post-test probability of the AC joint being the source of pain is 99 percent when both the Paxinos text and a bone scan are positive, while the combination of a negative Paxinos text and a negative bone scan virtually rules out an AC joint disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The Paxinos text is described above. (See <a href=\"#H9685368\" class=\"local\">'AC shear testing'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28813233\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The AC joint is a superficial structure amenable to evaluation with musculoskeletal ultrasound (US), which can provide useful diagnostic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As examples, US can be used to identify changes from degenerative joint disease (DJD) as well as Os acromiale (unfused acromial process epiphysis), which occurs in up to 8 percent of patients. The AC joint cysts associated with advanced DJD or massive rotator cuff tears also have classic US findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Ultrasound guidance likely improves the accuracy of AC joint injection, but studies remain preliminary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685403\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans provide great detail of AC joint degeneration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60796\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60796 \">image 2</a>). Unfortunately, the degree of abnormality does not correlate with symptoms and is therefore of limited use in clinical evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. MRI is more helpful for ruling out other pathology before pursuing surgical treatment of an AC joint disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17376056\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injection of an analgesic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>) into the AC joint can help to confirm that it is the source of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/2,10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,16</a>]. The technique involves identifying the superior aspect of the joint and then injecting directly into the joint or against the periosteum within a few millimeters of the joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A radiograph of the region provides a useful reference for positioning and identifying landmarks (eg, osteophyte lateral to the joint) while palpating and injecting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72604\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72604 \">picture 10</a>). Injection accuracy using palpation alone is limited and inferior to injection under ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2089419744\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound guided injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The AC joint lies just below the skin and is readily accessible to ultrasound-guided injection, which improves the accuracy of needle positioning within the joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Using sterile technique, the needle is advanced in the plane of the ultrasound image (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F116775\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116775 \">picture 11</a>). Once the needle is visualized within the joint, the medication is injected and can be seen flowing into the joint space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F116797\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef116797 \">image 3</a>). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2500021\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom the history, examination, and imaging studies suggest acromioclavicular (AC) joint pathology, a trial of conservative management is usually indicated. Pain stemming from AC joint pathology is confirmed by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History consistent with AC joint disorder (see <a href=\"#H9685312\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenderness directly over the AC joint without focal tenderness elsewhere. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the AC joint with provocative maneuvers (we use the cross body adduction test) (see <a href=\"#H9685354\" class=\"local\">'Special maneuvers for the AC joint'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of pain when shoulder examination maneuvers unrelated to the AC joint are performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal findings in the AC joint on radiographic studies (see <a href=\"#H17375993\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relief of pain with anesthetic injection of the AC joint</p><p/><p>If the diagnosis remains in question following the initial evaluation, a trial of medical treatment with serial follow-up examinations is a common approach.

The management of specific AC joint disorders is discussed in the following section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685417\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC DISORDERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685425\"><span class=\"h2\">Acromioclavicular joint injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries from direct trauma are common and, if moderate to severe, are often referred to as a shoulder &quot;separation.&quot; Treatment is based upon the type of injury and is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acromioclavicular-joint-injuries-separated-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acromioclavicular joint injuries (&quot;separated&quot; shoulder)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685448\"><span class=\"h2\">Overuse injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The AC joint is subject to inflammation from repetitive motion and stress, particularly activities involving an outstretched arm moving across the body. As an example, an athlete may develop AC joint arthralgia after adding overhead lifts or cross-body pulley exercises to a strength training routine. With low grade inflammation, the patient may have mild or moderate symptoms and pain when provocative AC maneuvers are performed, but few or no findings with diagnostic imaging. Treatment with rest, ice, and avoidance of painful activities may be sufficient. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a>, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and postural exercises may help allow the joint to heal. For athletes and workers with more demanding activities, physical therapy to adjust posture and techniques can be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685462\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteolysis of the distal clavicle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteolysis (ie, resorption of bone) of the distal clavicle is not common but can occur with overload of the AC joint from repetitive activity, and less commonly following direct trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. It develops most often in weight-lifters or other athletes who regularly perform heavy bench presses or military presses over many months or years, but can also occur in overhead athletes (eg, tennis players, swimmers) and workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>].</p><p>Examination findings include tenderness over the distal clavicle and AC joint. Provocative tests for AC disorders may reproduce the pain. (See <a href=\"#H9685354\" class=\"local\">'Special maneuvers for the AC joint'</a> above.)</p><p>Most patients have radiographic evidence of osteolysis. Early radiographic findings include bone loss or subchondral cyst formation at the distal clavicle. As the condition progresses, varying degrees of focal osteoporosis, loss of bone detail, and more severe cystic changes are seen. If stress continues unabated, the entire distal third of the clavicle may show signs of bone resorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53655\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53655 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71209\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71209 \">image 5</a>).</p><p>If the patient responds to treatment, the clinical evaluation combined with a suggestive radiograph is generally sufficient to make the diagnosis. Further imaging can be obtained if the patient does not respond to treatment or has atypical clinical features. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a positive bone scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] or bone marrow edema on MRI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65377\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65377 \">image 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Treatment consists of ice, over-the-counter analgesics, and rest from the offending activity. Technique changes, such as scapular retraction and a wider grip when performing the bench press may help to decrease the stress on the AC joint, but such interventions have not been formally studied. A glucocorticoid injection may allow an in-season athlete to tolerate symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>If a patient has ongoing pain despite conservative therapy or is unable or unwilling to decrease activity, resection of the distal clavicle successfully treats most cases of osteolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/20,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23,24</a>]. One case series reported good results at seven year follow-up in all 19 patients treated with distal clavicle resection for nontraumatic osteolysis, and 14 were able to return to weight training and sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685469\"><span class=\"h2\">Painful degeneration of the AC joint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The AC joint typically degenerates more rapidly than most other joints in the body. Radiographic signs of degeneration are often present in asymptomatic individuals in their mid-40s. However, less than 5 percent of the population develops a painful AC joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The term AC joint arthrosis refers to asymptomatic joints with radiographic evidence of degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Degeneration is described radiographically using the typical findings of osteoarthritis, including joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cyst formation, and osteophyte formation. Such findings may develop more rapidly following trauma or repetitive stress. The progression of AC arthrosis or arthritis is readily seen on serial radiographs or MRI imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64052\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64052 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75836\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75836 \">image 8</a>). Some authors differentiate post-traumatic and primary osteoarthritis, but management is similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In cases of symptomatic AC degeneration, pain may extend over the AC joint, deltoid, or trapezius areas, and often worsens with activities involving overhead or cross body movement of the arm. The patient may experience a painful grinding around the joint. Examination findings include palpable enlargement of the joint and reproduction of pain with provocative maneuvers. The severity of a patient's symptoms may not correlate with the extent of radiographic changes.</p><p>Treatment of painful AC joint degeneration begins with activity modification, rest, ice, and over-the-counter analgesics. Exercises to improve scapular retraction may be useful.</p><p>Injection with glucocorticoids may help some patients by providing short-term pain relief of acute flares but is unlikely to alter the long-term course of AC joint arthritis. Uncontrolled observational studies suggest that relief from injections is variable. In a retrospective study of patients with isolated, painful AC joint degeneration, 25 of 27 patients had short-term improvement of pain lasting an average of 21 days following glucocorticoid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, 18 of the 27 patients ultimately required distal clavicle resection due to persistent pain. Better outcomes were noted in a prospective study of the long-term effectiveness of AC injections for osteoarthritis in 25 shoulders in 20 consecutive patients: improvement in pain and functioning persisted at 6 and 12 months but tended to diminish over the longer term out to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Distal clavicle resection for painful AC joint degeneration provides good to excellent results in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/10,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,23,24</a>]. A complete evaluation and diagnostic injection test should be performed prior to surgery, preferably by the surgeon. A major reason for poor outcomes after distal clavicle resection is persistent pain from other shoulder pathology. A preoperative MRI or intraoperative arthroscopic evaluation of the rotator cuff and labrum can help prevent this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/15,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,27</a>]. Arthroscopic resection allows a faster return to activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9685483\"><span class=\"h2\">Other conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the AC joint is a synovial joint, it may develop inflammatory or septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As an example, two-thirds of rheumatoid arthritis patients develop AC joint involvement in their lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acromioclavicular-joint-disorders/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Infections, tumors, cysts, and other conditions may develop in and around the joint and cause pain.

No single examination technique is definitive for evaluating the AC joint. A suggestive history, focal tenderness at the AC joint, pain with provocative maneuvers (eg, cross body adduction test), and the absence of pain when shoulder examination maneuvers unrelated to the AC joint are performed are strongly suggestive. Injection of an analgesic may help to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H9685305\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of the painful AC joint'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2500021\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain caused by trauma to the AC joint is common.

However, only a small percentage of those with degenerative arthrosis develop painful osteoarthritis. Initial treatment for painful AC joint degeneration consists of ice, over-the-counter analgesics, and activity modification. If persistent, pain may be treated with glucocorticoid injection for short-term relief, but this is unlikely to alter the long-term course of the disease. Resection of the distal clavicle for AC joint osteoarthritis is helpful for the majority of patients with ongoing pain.
