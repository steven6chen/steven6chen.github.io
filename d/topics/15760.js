These organs include the skin, joints, muscles, blood, lung, heart, kidney, and nerves. Symptoms or signs related to involvement of the nerves (such as burning pain in the extremities), lungs (cough, shortness of breath), blood (anemia, low white blood cell or platelet count), and kidneys (frequent urination, low potassium) affect less than 20 percent of people with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s. These types of involvement are referred to as systemic manifestations. People with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s also have an increased risk of developing lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system.</p><p>Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome may occur by itself or in association with another autoimmune condition, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (also called SLE or just lupus), rheumatoid arthritis, or scleroderma (a condition that affects the skin and connective tissue).</p><p>Although there is no cure for Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, a number of treatments are available. This article discusses the possible causes, symptoms, diagnostic process, and treatments of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SJ&Ouml;GREN'S SYNDROME CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome is thought to be caused by an abnormal reaction of the body&rsquo;s immune system. Lymphocytes are cells in the body&rsquo;s immune system which travel between the blood and the lymphatic system (including the spleen and lymph nodes) to protect the body from infection and cancer. In Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, these cells recognize certain tissues in the body, particularly the glands that produce tears and saliva, as &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; and attack them, causing inflammation and damage.</p><p>A person who develops Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome probably inherits the risk from one or both parents and is then exposed to some type of environmental trigger (eg, a viral infection), but the exact cause is not known. Thus, both genetic and non-genetic factors play a role. Genome sequencing of people with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome in both the United States and Asia has added greatly to experts' understanding of the genetic factors by identifying at least five different risk-related major gene regions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SJ&Ouml;GREN'S SYNDROME SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic symptoms of Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome are dry mouth (due to decreased production of saliva) and dry eyes (due to decreased production of tears). Such symptoms of dryness are commonly reported by otherwise healthy people, but people with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome will typically report that the dryness is present every day for at least three months. These symptoms can also be caused by conditions other than Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome. Therefore, it is important to identify medications or other conditions that could be responsible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Exocrine gland disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The decreased fluid production in the eyes and mouth can lead to additional problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye pain and blurred vision, resulting from injury to the cornea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of cavities in the teeth and infections in the mouth, including painful fungal infections (a yeast infection or thrush)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SJ&Ouml;GREN'S SYNDROME DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H156274055\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome typically requires the expertise of a rheumatologist (specialist in autoimmune diseases and arthritis), ophthalmologist (eye specialist), and dentist or oral medicine specialist. In a person with daily persistent symptoms of dry eyes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mouth, a diagnosis of Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome requires an objective measure of dry eyes (see <a href=\"#H4014235415\" class=\"local\">'Eye tests'</a> below) or deficient saliva production (see <a href=\"#H3186923470\" class=\"local\">'Salivary gland tests'</a> below) as well as evidence of an underlying autoimmune disorder. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Blood tests'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Lip biopsy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two international medical organizations endorsed a common set of criteria for the classification of Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome in 2016. These criteria are intended primarily to ensure international agreement as to what constitutes Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome; their fulfillment is typically a requirement for entry into clinical trials and other research studies. These criteria are commonly used to establish a formal diagnosis of Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome in clinical practice but occasionally fail to enable this diagnosis in people with early disease or unusual presentations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4014235415\"><span class=\"h2\">Eye tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests are usually recommended to determine if you produce an abnormally low amount of tears and to find out if any parts of your eyes have been damaged as a result of dryness.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Schirmer test &ndash; In the Schirmer test, a small strip of sterile filter paper is inserted gently between your eye and eyelid in the inner corner of the eye. It is removed after several minutes, and the wetness on the paper is then measured. A below-normal amount of wetting is characteristic of Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, although decreased tear production can also occur with other conditions. An ophthalmologist or a rheumatologist may perform this test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular surface staining tests &ndash; Damage to the surface of the eye develops as a result of chronic dryness and inflammation. The damage is best revealed with dyes that can safely be applied to the eye surface (using eye drops). Using a low-power microscope and thin light beam (called a &quot;slit lamp&quot;), an ophthalmologist can examine the surface of your eye and detect this damage, with the aid of the special dyes. The two most commonly used stains are lissamine green and fluorescein, which cause minimal irritation to the eye. Rose bengal stain is used less commonly since it can be irritating. Lissamine green and rose bengal stain the whites of the eyes blue-green and pink-red, respectively, but this staining disappears after a few hours.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3186923470\"><span class=\"h2\">Salivary gland tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Saliva flow rates may be tested by several different methods. The most common is measurement of the volume of saliva after you spit into a pre-weighed cup. There are also more complex methods that involve testing for a particular substance in the saliva; these are more accurate but also more expensive. Other methods, such as ultrasound, are being studied as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of blood tests are typically done in people with suspected Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome. One of the most important is a test for the presence of certain antibodies that are markers for autoimmune disorders. These include the antinuclear antibody (ANA) and the Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s-associated <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/SSA</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">La/SSB</span> antibodies. Rheumatoid factor (another kind of antibody) may also be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antinuclear-antibodies-ana-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Lip biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A salivary gland biopsy may be recommended to aid in the diagnosis of Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, particularly if the tests for <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/SSA</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">La/SSB</span> antibodies are negative. The biopsy is done by removing a small piece of tissue from the inner portion of the lip for testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2170125827\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship between Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome and SLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; lupus) have many similar genetic, clinical, and laboratory features. However, the types of rashes, lung involvement, renal involvement, and frequency of lymphoma are different in Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome and SLE. Detailed genetic studies have shown differences between the two disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16910292\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the classic symptoms associated with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome (dry mouth and dry eyes), people with the disorder also have a higher risk of developing diseases of the lung (called interstitial pneumonitis), diseases of the kidneys (interstitial nephritis), and thyroid gland abnormalities. Some may develop inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). Vasculitis can cause bleeding and pain and can lead to skin, nerve, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> internal organ damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vasculitis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome also increases the risk of a cancer of the lymphatic system (most commonly non-Hodgkin lymphoma). The lymphatic system includes the tissues and organs that produce and store cells that fight infection, including the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=follicular-lymphoma-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Follicular lymphoma in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The skin may be affected by dryness (xerosis) and various types of rashes, including small &ldquo;blood spots&rdquo; on the lower legs (purpura, stemming from inflammation of the blood vessels), vasculitis (particularly small vessel involvement), and red ring-like lesions with a central pale area (annular erythema).</p><p>Neurologic involvement includes damage to peripheral nerves, leading to uncomfortable sensations in the skin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distal parts of the extremities, such as the hands and feet, including burning, numbness, or discomfort with light touch. Less common forms can lead to imbalance and poor coordination. Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome can also affect the brain and spinal cord. The most common form of this involvement is demyelination (damage to the myelin, which is the material that covers and protects nerves), leading to symptoms and signs similar to what is seen in multiple sclerosis.</p><p>Blood involvement can result in low red blood cell counts or anemia (sometimes leading to fatigue and shortness of breath), low white cell counts (sometimes leading to frequent infections), and low platelet counts (sometimes leading to bleeding).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SJ&Ouml;GREN'S SYNDROME TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome can be divided into three basic areas (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dry eye in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: General principles and initial therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dry mouth and other non-ocular sicca symptoms in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of dry eyes and mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of problems such as oral yeast infections, eyelid irritation (blepharitis), and acid reflux. These problems can complicate Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome and can make the condition less responsive to other therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of fatigue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vague symptoms of poor concentration and of impaired memory (such as fibromyalgia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Fibromyalgia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Treatment of systemic manifestations has been the subject of multiple trials, but none of the investigational therapies have yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this purpose. Fortunately, trials are continuing to find ways to improve the dry eye and dry mouth symptoms and the other manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of dry eyes and dry mouth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people use artificial tears (eye drops) to treat dry eyes. Many different solutions are available; a clinician can recommend an appropriate choice based upon your pattern of dryness and fluid production in the eye.</p><p>Some people are sensitive to the preservatives found in artificial tears. If you notice a burning or itching feeling, you can try a brand with a non-irritating preservative. Alternatively, there is a preservative-free version of moisturizing eye drops. These come in small, single-dose containers that may be hard to open for some people who have joint <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vision problems. Prescription eye drops containing the medications cyclosporine or lifitegrast, which suppress part of the local immune reaction, are also available.</p><p>At night, you can use an eye ointment to provide moisture. It is important to use only a small amount (about <span class=\"nowrap\">1/8</span> inches or 3 mm) of the ointment, because overuse can block the ducts and can lead to a condition called blepharitis. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Blepharitis (eyelid inflammation)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Preserving natural tears</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are various measures you can try to preserve your own tears. Shields can be fitted on the sides of glasses, helping to protect the eyes from air and wind, reducing evaporation of tears. Goggles or wraparound sunglasses serve a similar function.</p><p>Another approach is a simple procedure called punctal occlusion. In this procedure, an ophthalmologist inserts tiny plugs into the tear ducts in the corner of the lower eyelid, nearest the nose, where the tears normally collect and drain into the nose. By blocking this duct, your tears stay on the eye longer. There are several types of plugs, one of which does not touch the surface of the eyeball; these plugs are generally preferred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Stimulating saliva</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simply sucking on sugarless candy or dried fruit slices (eg, peaches or nectarines) can stimulate the flow of saliva. Citrus-flavored sugarless tablets and sugar-free chewing gum may also be helpful. In some people who do not respond adequately to such measures, medications (eg, pilocarpine or cevimeline) can be given to increase saliva production.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Replacing secretions in the mouth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sipping on water throughout the day is an easy and effective treatment of dry mouth for many people. The water does not have to be swallowed. It can be rinsed around the mouth and then spit out.</p><p>If this doesn't help, an artificial saliva product (spray or lozenge) may be helpful. If you have painful gums, a gel that relieves dry mouth can be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Preventing cavities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome are at increased risk for dental cavities. You should brush and floss after eating meals and snacks. It is important for you to visit your dentist at least every six months for a cleaning and evaluation.</p><p>Toothpastes designed specifically for people with dry mouth are available. These lack the detergents that are present in many types of toothpaste but can irritate a dry mouth. Toothbrushes with special features that help clean between the teeth (including electric toothbrushes) may also help to keep your teeth clean.</p><p>Toothpaste with fluoride (or a special fluoride rinse or varnish) may help to prevent cavities. A fluoride treatment after each dental cleaning may also be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Dryness in other areas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome may have dryness in other areas, including the lips, the skin, and the vagina. For dry lips, you can use petroleum jelly or lip salves. Dry skin usually improves with frequent and liberal use of a moisturizing cream or ointment. &ldquo;Extra dry skin&rdquo; lotion can be applied in the morning and at bedtime (and after baths or showers).</p><p>Some women with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome have difficulty with vaginal dryness, especially after menopause. There are several products specifically designed for vaginal dryness, including vaginal moisturizers, estrogen cream, vitamin E oil, hyaluronic acid suppositories, and vaginal lubricants. Adequate artificial lubrication applied to BOTH partners can prevent painful intercourse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-dryness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaginal dryness (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Treating other Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s-related problems</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Fungal infections in the mouth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prescription medications are available to treat painful mouth lesions due to oral candidiasis (yeast infection, also called thrush). Sugar-free lozenges can also help. If you wear dentures and have had a fungal infection, be sure to disinfect them overnight to prevent the fungus from coming back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Dry nose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to treat dry nose or stuffiness because blocked nasal passages can increase mouth breathing and can worsen dry mouth. Saline nasal sprays are available in most drugstores.</p><p>Other causes of nasal blockage, including allergy or sinus infection, should be treated promptly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-seasonal-allergies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Allergic rhinitis (seasonal allergies) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonallergic-rhinitis-runny-or-stuffy-nose-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonallergic rhinitis (runny or stuffy nose) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Blepharitis (eyelid inflammation)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eyelid inflammation, also called blepharitis, causes symptoms that are similar to those of dry eye (swollen lids and redness of the inside of the lids). Gently washing the skin of the eyelids can relieve blepharitis. You can do this with a warm, wet washcloth and a small amount of &ldquo;no tears&rdquo; shampoo or non-soap face cleanser. With the eyes closed, the excess debris should be rubbed from the inner eye outward to the outer eye area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blepharitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blepharitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Reflux (heartburn)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acid reflux is more common in people with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome. This is probably due to the decreased production of saliva, which normally helps to reduce the acidity of stomach acid. Treatment of reflux in people with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome is similar to treatment in other people. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Joint and muscle pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen are recommended for the joint pain that may accompany Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Low-dose glucocorticoids (also called steroids) such as prednisone may improve joint pain. However, glucocorticoids are generally recommended for short-term treatment because of serious side effects with long-term use (eg, weight gain, high blood pressure, diabetes, bone thinning).</p><p>A class of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is commonly used in people with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis to slow the immune system&rsquo;s destructive effects. Similar treatments have been used in patients with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-sjogrens-syndrome-constitutional-and-non-sicca-organ-based-manifestations#H2721694687\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Constitutional and non-sicca organ-based manifestations&quot;, section on 'Musculoskeletal pain'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue is common in Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome. Fatigue may be due to the active inflammation associated with the disease itself, fibromyalgia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sleep disturbances. Sleep problems can result if you drink a lot of water to treat dry mouth and then need to get up frequently at night to urinate.</p><p>General treatment for fatigue includes the attention to diet and exercise that has been helpful in people with fibromyalgia. In addition, in people with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, it is important to adequately control symptoms of dry mouth and dry eye that interfere with sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51203\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51203 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insomnia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Insomnia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Fibromyalgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome also have a condition called fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia causes muscle aching and fatigue. The treatment of fibromyalgia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Fibromyalgia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5802748\"><span class=\"h3\">Vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasculitis is inflammation of blood vessels. Damage to arteries or veins may result in bleeding, pain, and damage to skin, nerves, and internal organs. When vasculitis occurs, it often requires treatment with drugs that suppress the immune system. Medications such as cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil may be prescribed by clinicians experienced in their use. Careful monitoring for side effects and for response to treatment is necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vasculitis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia and Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you need surgery, the anesthesiologist should be made aware of your diagnosis of Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome. This is because Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome can increase the risks of general anesthesia. There may be an increased risk of developing mucous plugs in the airways during and after surgery, and medications used during the surgery can dry the airways further. If aware of the diagnosis of Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, the anesthesiologist can take special measures to lower the risk of these complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3959273496\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy outcomes in women with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome are generally similar to those of healthy women. However, women with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome who have <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> antibodies have a small risk of giving birth to a baby with a condition called &ldquo;neonatal lupus,&rdquo; which sometimes includes the baby being born with a potentially serious heart problem called congenital heart block. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Blood tests'</a> above.)</p><p>Neonatal lupus with congenital heart block occurs in about 2 to 4 percent of newborns of mother with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome who have these antibodies.
