For example, in a Canadian registry of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) from 15 tertiary care pediatric centers, 25 percent of the enrolled patients had cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thromboembolism-in-children-with-cancer/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Based upon data from this registry, the incidence of DVT and PE in the general pediatric population was estimated to be about 0.07 events per 10,000 children (0.0007 percent) compared with reported incidences ranging from 7 to 10 percent in children with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thromboembolism-in-children-with-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p>Several studies have shown that TE is becoming increasingly prevalent in children with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thromboembolism-in-children-with-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Children with cancer and TE have increased risk of mortality, TE-related morbidity, and increased risk of recurrence of TE as compared with children without cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thromboembolism-in-children-with-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The rates of TE vary for specific malignancies. In one retrospective study of 726 children with cancer, the risk of TE was highest in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), followed by sarcoma and lymphoma, and the lowest risk was seen in children with brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thromboembolism-in-children-with-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombotic events, including DVT, intracranial dural sinus thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism are not uncommon in children with ALL. Major risk factors for TE in this population include treatment with asparaginase, concomitant use of steroids, thrombophilic genetic abnormalities, and the presence of a central venous line (CVL). In addition, non-O blood group was identified as an independent risk factor for thrombotic events in a retrospective single institutional study of 523 patients with ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thromboembolism-in-children-with-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Thrombosis in children undergoing treatment for ALL is discussed in detail separately.

The vast majority of non-central nervous system (CNS) thromboembolic events in children are central venous line (CVL)-related and, thus, likely located in the upper venous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thromboembolism-in-children-with-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Non-CVL-related TE can occur in any venous system, but most commonly present in the lower extremities, especially in the iliac, femoral, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> popliteal veins. TE may also develop in specific organ systems, including the CNS, lung, liver, and kidney. The CNS thromboses include arterial ischemic stroke or hemorrhage, or sinovenous thrombosis.

For example, a headache due to cerebral sinovenous thrombosis may be attributed to intrathecal chemotherapy or hypertension due to glucocorticoid therapy in a child receiving antileukemic therapy. As a result, making the diagnosis may be challenging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed. Hence, a high index of suspicion is essential for earlier diagnosis of thrombosis in children with cancer.</p><p>The diagnostic approach of a thrombosis in the child with cancer is similar to the approach in a child without malignancy, and is dependent upon the clinical findings and likely site of involvement. The diagnosis is made by confirming the presence of thrombosis by imaging studies, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system (CNS) involvement &minus; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR angiography (MRA), or digital-subtraction angiography. In suspected cases of sinovenous thrombosis, a computed tomographic (CT) venogram may also be performed instead of MR venography (MRV).

The management of TE must balance the risk of progression or recurrence of thrombosis due to conservative therapy, and the increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy. In addition, children with cancer are more likely to undergo invasive procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and surgical procedures), which may result in bleeding or clinically significant bleeding.</p><p>Evidence-based guidelines to prevent thromboembolism in children with cancer are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thromboembolism-in-children-with-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Based upon these observations, as well as the data from adult patients with cancer, the following is our current approach for secondary prophylaxis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest anticoagulation prophylaxis in patients previously treated for TE with ongoing thrombotic risk factors, such as usage of asparaginase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We offer prophylaxis in patients with relapsed cancer and who have been diagnosed with TE in association with primary cancer therapy, and who will receive active cancer therapy.</p><p/><p>We may elect to discontinue anticoagulation, even in the presence of an indwelling CVL, if the line remains for a prolonged period of time (eg, two years or greater), provided other significant risk factors (eg, asparaginase) have been removed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with cancer are at increased risk for thromboembolic events (TE) compared with the general pediatric population. The overall reported prevalence ranges from 7 to 10 percent. The rates of TE vary for specific malignancies, with the highest risk of TE in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), followed by sarcoma and lymphoma, and the lowest risk in those with brain tumors. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of TE in children with cancer are similar to those seen in children without cancer. Clinical manifestations vary depending upon the location and extent of the thrombus, acuteness of the event, and the age of the patient. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with cancer, the presentation of a thromboembolic event may be complicated or be confused by other cancer-associated problems with similar clinical features. Hence, a high index of suspicion is essential. The diagnosis of TE is confirmed by imaging studies. The preferred imaging study varies depending upon the location and extent of the thrombus. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with cancer, the management of TE is challenging because children with cancer are at risk for both thrombus progression and recurrence, as well as bleeding due to chemotherapy-related thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. In addition, there are limited data to guide therapy for the prevention and management of TE in these patients. As a result, current management is based primarily upon expert experience and opinion. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The following recommendations for management of children with cancer and thrombosis are those of the authors, and take into account our interpretation of the available evidence and attempt to balance benefits, burdens, and potential risk.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend anticoagulation in all children with cancer and TE if there is no contraindication for anticoagulation, such as active bleeding or a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;30,000/microL</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">unfractionated heparin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">warfarin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
