Nevertheless, the prognosis for a successful future pregnancy is generally good: The overall live birth rates after normal and abnormal diagnostic evaluations for RPL are 77 and 71 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Therapeutic intervention is guided by the underlying cause of RPL. In all cases, emotional support is important in caring for these often anxious couples, and may enhance therapeutic success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Management of RPL will be discussed here. Causes and evaluation of RPL are reviewed separately.

They should receive information regarding the probability of having a chromosomally normal or abnormal conception in the future. In the latter case, the risk of miscarriage and bearing a chromosomally abnormal offspring who may be phenotypically normal or abnormal and a carrier of a chromosomal defect should be discussed. The magnitude of these risks varies according to the specific chromosomal abnormality and the sex of the carrier parent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chromosomal-translocations-deletions-and-inversions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chromosomal translocations, deletions, and inversions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytogenetic abnormalities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Couples with karyotypic abnormalities may choose to undergo prenatal genetic studies, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, to determine the fetal karyotype. Pregnancy termination is an option if the fetus is affected. In vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) can be used to avoid transfer and implantation of an affected embryo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. PGD improves the pregnancy outcome of translocation carriers with a history of repeated pregnancy loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. On the other hand, this procedure reduces the live birth rate after IVF if preimplantation testing is performed solely because of advanced maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gamete donation (egg or sperm), surrogacy, and adoption are methods of preventing conception of an affected embryo. The choice depends upon the specific abnormality and parental preference.

These conditions can be treated hysteroscopically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of congenital uterine anomalies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-adhesions-clinical-manifestation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine adhesions: Clinical manifestation and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive issues in women with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no randomized trials evaluating pregnancy outcome after surgical correction of uterine anomalies.

However, studies using better control groups also support the efficacy of surgical correction of uterine defects. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study, the probability of conception and live birth in women after hysteroscopic metroplasty was significantly higher than in women with unexplained infertility (live birth rate 34.1 versus 18.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, the effect of uterine septum on IVF outcome was investigated in 289 embryo transfers before and 538 embryo transfers after hysteroscopic resection of uterine septum and in a control group that underwent two consecutive embryo transfers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. For women with a large septum, the live birth rate was 2.7 percent before surgery and 15.6 percent after surgery versus 20.9 percent in the control group. For women with a small septum, the live birth rate was 2.8 percent before surgery and 18.6 percent after surgery versus 21.9 percent in the control group. &#160;</p><p/><p>The value of prophylactic cervical cerclage in women with a uterine anomaly, but no history of second trimester pregnancy loss, is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Euthyroid women with high serum thyroid peroxidase antibody concentrations may benefit from treatment with thyroid hormone during pregnancy as this therapy may reduce the risk of miscarriage and preterm birth. In a randomized trial, administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> (median dose 50 mcg daily) to early pregnant euthyroid women with positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies decreased the miscarriage rate from 13.8 to 3.5 percent (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.13-2.25) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, the incidence of premature deliveries in treated women was lower than in those who were not treated (7 versus 22.4 percent, RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.18-2.34). A limitation of this study is that the mean gestational age of starting therapy was 10 weeks, and all but one of the losses had occurred at less than 11 weeks. Further study is required to evaluate the efficacy of levothyroxine in women with RPL and positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies.

This rate must be considered in evaluating therapies for unexplained RPL.</p><p>Although data may be lacking, treatments that may be offered to couples with unexplained RPL include the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiological studies suggest that lifestyle modifications can increase fertility potential, although these have not been definitively tested in randomized trials.

In the largest trial, which included over 800 women with RPL randomly assigned to first-trimester vaginal progesterone therapy or placebo, approximately two-thirds of women in each group delivered a live infant after 24 weeks of gestation (progesterone and placebo birth rates: 66 versus 63 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Further, there were no differences between the groups in the rates of clinical pregnancy at 6 to 8 weeks, ongoing pregnancy at 12 weeks, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, or stillbirth. There were also no differences in neonatal outcomes. </p><p>This trial result differs from prior meta-analyses that reported a reduction in miscarriage with progesterone treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Possible explanations for the discrepant results are that the meta-analyses included fewer patients (range 132 to 225 women), included identical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], included some trials that lacked a placebo comparator, and included trials with poor methodology. While a subsequent larger meta-analysis did report a decreased risk of miscarriage (relative risk 0.72, 95% CI 0.53&ndash;0.97) and increased live birth rate (relative risk 1.07, 95% CI 1.02&ndash;1.15) with first-trimester progestogen supplementation compared with placebo or no treatment, the effects were modest and multiple types of progestogens were used, which limits the interpretation and clinical applicability of the information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As a result of these factors, we base our treatment approach on the above trial with 800 women.</p><p>It is not known if treatment with intramuscular progesterone or other progestins would improve the live birth rate in women with RPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Additionally, as the therapeutic effect of progesterone may be related to immune modulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], it is possible that earlier initiation of progesterone, such as during the luteal phase, may improve outcome. As an example, in a small study of women with RPL (defined as two or more unexplained pregnancy losses &lt;10 weeks of gestation), luteal phase treatment with micronized progesterone improved the 10-week pregnancy rate for the subgroup with elevated nCyclinE expression (&gt;20 percent), compared with their prior pregnancy success (69 versus 6 percent). Live birth rates were not reported. However, as benefit was seen in only one subgroup of women in a small study, we do not prescribe luteal phase micronized progesterone in women with RPL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Human menopausal gonadotropin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An observational study reported that controlled ovarian stimulation via human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) administration appeared effective for treatment of endometrial defects in women with RPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

In another trial of 449 women with RPL and no thrombophilia, there were no differences in live birth rates between women randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dalteparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dalteparin</a> 5000 IU daily versus placebo (86 and 87 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78195469\"><span class=\"h2\">Human chorionic gonadotropin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) therapy during early gestation may be useful in preventing miscarriage since endogenous hCG is known to play a critical role in the establishment of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A systematic review of four trials involving 180 women with RPL found hCG therapy was associated with a significantly reduced risk of miscarriage (odds ratio [OR] 0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.52), particularly in women with oligomenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, there were important methodological weaknesses in two of these studies. To date, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of hCG to prevent pregnancy loss in women with a history of unexplained RPL. Large randomized controlled trials are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78195528\"><span class=\"h2\">Clomiphene citrate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By increasing serum FSH, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate increases follicular number and serum estradiol levels, which should lead to an increase in the number of corpora lutea and a higher midluteal progesterone concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Two randomized trials comparing clomiphene to progesterone for treatment of inadequate luteal phase demonstrated similar pregnancy rates (20 to 30 percent) with each treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Clomiphene, unlike progesterone, does not prolong the luteal phase, thereby lessening the anxiety and period of uncertainty of infertile couples concerning possible conception. Due to the anti-estrogen effect of clomiphene on the endometrium, we do not use clomiphene in women with RPL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1446563906\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systematic reviews have consistently found no beneficial effect of immunotherapy for treatment of RPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/18,19,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,55-57</a>]. The general findings are illustrated by the following two examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of 20 trials of high quality showed that immunotherapy did not result in a statistically significant improvement in live births compared to untreated controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Four types of immunotherapy were evaluated: paternal cell immunization (odd ratio [OR] 1.23, 95% CI 0.89-1.70; 12 studies including 641 participants); third party donor cell immunization (OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.68-2.82; three studies including 156 participants); trophoblast membrane infusion (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11-1.45; one study including 37 participants); and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.61-1.58; eight studies including 303 participants).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another systematic review evaluated three randomized and two cohort trials of immunotherapy treatment specifically in patients who failed IVF; a total of 373 patients were involved in these trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Patients treated with IVIG showed a consistently higher live birth rate than untreated controls; this benefit was statistically significant when the trial results were pooled in meta-analysis. However, there were many differences among these trials, such as the preparations used, the timing of the intervention (preconception, postconception, both), and dosage, as well as the immunological abnormalities of the patients. In addition, some controls received heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> while others did not receive any therapy. Thus, appropriate use of this therapy remains unclear.</p><p/><p>Immune therapy of RPL should be considered experimental, and used only in the setting of a clinical trial regulated by an Institutional Review Board.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1446564037\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids have several anti-inflammatory effects, including suppression of natural killer cell activity, but do not appear to be effective for preventing RPL. This was illustrated by a trial in which 202 women with RPL and a variety of autoantibodies (antinuclear, anti-DNA, antilymphocyte, anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant) were randomly assigned to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (0.5 to 0.8 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (100 mg per day) or placebo for the duration of the pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The two groups did not have a statistically significant difference in rate of live birth (66 and 56 percent, respectively).</p><p>Oral administration of glucocorticoids for treatment of RPL has been abandoned because of uncertain efficacy and a clearly demonstrable increase in complications, such as preterm premature rupture of membranes, gestational diabetes, and maternal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

At five years after the initial visit to a tertiary care center for RPL, 67 percent of women had a live birth. Increasing maternal age and a higher number of miscarriages at time of initial visit were associated with a significant decrease in the likelihood of having a live birth. Another study of women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss showed that 167 of 222 women who conceived subsequently had a successful pregnancy beyond 24 weeks of gestation (75 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p>In women with recurrent early first trimester pregnancy loss, the presence of fetal cardiac activity is reassuring of subsequent viable delivery, although the pregnancy loss rate remains above that of the general population. A literature review of studies examining fetal loss rates after sonographic demonstration of fetal cardiac activity reported the rate of such losses in women with RPL was 5 to 22 percent compared to 7 to 15 percent in infertile populations and 3 to 6 percent in controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Second trimester pregnancy loss is significantly associated with recurrent second trimester loss and future spontaneous preterm birth. After a second trimester pregnancy loss, one study reported 39 percent of women had a preterm delivery in their next pregnancy, 5 percent had a stillbirth, and 6 percent had a neonatal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In another study of 30 women with second trimester loss, the frequency of recurrent second trimester loss was 27 percent and the frequency of subsequent preterm birth was 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26414616\"><span class=\"h2\">Other obstetric issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with a history of RPL who become pregnant may be at higher risk for developing fetal growth restriction and premature delivery, but not for gestational hypertension or diabetes. As an example, a retrospective cohort study compared 2030 women with RPL to over 28,000 control women and reported an increased incidence of preterm birth (8 versus 5.5 percent), very preterm birth &lt;32 weeks gestation (2.2 versus 1.2 percent), and perinatal death (1.2 versus 0.5 percent) for the women with RPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].
