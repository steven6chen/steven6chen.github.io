Pulmonary disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of CF lung disease is experiencing a period of rapid evolution, supported by well-designed clinical trials and improved understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Undoubtedly, these advancements are responsible for a substantial portion of the improvement that has occurred in patient survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61930\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61930 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>While the focus of this discussion is on pulmonary therapies, it must be kept in mind that management is often suboptimal unless the multisystem nature of the disease is considered. Sinus infection, nutritional status, glucose control, and psychosocial issues must all be assessed at regular intervals. This requires a multidisciplinary approach to care that, in the United States, is best provided at one of the approximately 115 CF Care Centers (most with dedicated adult care programs) that are supported and accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Patients treated at these centers are seen on a regular basis by physicians, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers with special competence in CF care. A listing of these centers can be obtained at the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Web site (<a href=\"http://www.cff.org/&amp;token=bmTq7ZuIcyocF4e9UyYv8gN0xUdpqx98Oi7BGt9iuCY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6372\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cff.org</a>). In the United Kingdom, CF patients receiving their medical care at specialized CF centers have better clinical outcomes compared with patients followed in the general community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In the United States, more frequent caregiver-patient interaction (visit frequency, monitoring, and interventions for pulmonary exacerbations) is associated with improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>An overview of the treatment of CF lung disease will be reviewed here. Details of treatment with antibiotics are discussed separately. The diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and investigational treatments for CF are discussed separately.

The indications and efficacy of these drugs depend upon the CFTR mutation in the individual patient. Therefore, all CF patients should undergo CFTR genotyping to determine if they carry a mutation that makes them eligible for CFTR modulator therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066239125\"><span class=\"h2\">Ivacaftor for gating and residual function mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ivacaftor</a> (VX-770) is a small molecular weight oral drug that was specifically designed to treat patients who have a <strong>G551D</strong> mutation in at least one of their CFTR genes. The G551D mutation, which occurs in approximately 4.4 percent of CF patients, is called a &quot;gating mutation&quot; because it impairs the regulated opening of the ion channel that is formed by the CFTR protein (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Class III mutations: Defective regulation'</a>). Ivacaftor was developed using high-throughput screening of large chemical libraries, by which candidate molecules (called &quot;potentiators&quot;) were identified that increased chloride ion flux in cultured cells expressing G551D CFTR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. From these candidate molecules, ivacaftor was developed and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States for patients with this mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Subsequent clinical trials have shown that ivacaftor benefits patients with other CFTR gating mutations, which allowed the FDA to expand the number of gating mutations approved for ivacaftor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116943\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116943 \">table 1A</a>)<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Ivacaftor has also been tested in cells expressing CFTR mutations of a type that allows a low level of CFTR function but not enough to prevent CF disease, known as &quot;residual function&quot; mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113340\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113340 \">table 1B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The combination of data from laboratory studies and data from CF patients with these residual function mutations led the FDA to approve them for ivacaftor as well. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ivacaftor</a> was the first approved CF therapy that restores the functioning of a mutant CF protein rather than trying to target one or more of its downstream consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Data from clinical trials of ivacaftor demonstrated that the benefits are durable and its safety profile favorable. Furthermore, the results of in vitro studies performed on cells with different CFTR mutations were very predictive of which patients would benefit clinically from ivacaftor based on their CFTR genotype. This has allowed the FDA to approve ivacaftor for additional CFTR mutations using laboratory findings alone when it would be not be possible to perform adequately powered clinical trials due to the small number of CF patients who have these uncommon mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103261705\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications and dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a> for patients age two and older who carry at least one copy of a gating mutation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116943\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116943 \">table 1A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/10,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14-16</a>].

Dosing should be interrupted if the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations are more than five times the upper limit of normal. Studies done in juvenile rats found formation of cataracts at doses of ivacaftor above those recommended for humans. Furthermore, non-congenital lens opacities have been reported in children up to 12 years of age receiving ivacaftor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although other risk factors for cataracts were often present (eg, glucocorticoid use), the FDA recommended that baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations should be performed in pediatric patients receiving ivacaftor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103261711\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>G551D mutation</strong> &ndash; Clinical trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a> in patients with a G551D mutation have demonstrated important benefits: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a phase 3 multicenter randomized trial of 161 subjects 12 years of age or older with a G551D mutation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a> for 24 weeks improved mean percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) by 10.4 percent compared with a decline by 0.2 percent in subjects receiving a placebo (primary endpoint, p&lt;0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The beneficial effect was maintained through 48 weeks of ivacaftor treatment. Ivacaftor also decreased sweat chloride values by 48.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> compared with that in the placebo group (p&lt;0.001), bringing the mean value in the ivacaftor group to 51.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> which is below the cutoff point of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> that is used for diagnosing CF. Finally, treatment with ivacaftor reduced the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations (55 percent reduction in risk), improved pulmonary symptoms, and resulted in a significant weight gain of 2.7 kg after 48 weeks of treatment. The frequency of serious adverse events was lower in the ivacaftor group than in the placebo-treated patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Another randomized, blinded, placebo controlled trial of 52 subjects age 6 to 11 years and at least one G551D CFTR mutation found similar improvements in lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An open-label follow-up of both of these studies demonstrated durable beneficial effects for at least three years of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a> treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. After 36 months of treatment, the absolute change in FEV<sub>1</sub> was approximately 10 percentage points compared with baseline, and patients also had improved body weight and a reduced rate of pulmonary exacerbations. Moreover, the decline in lung function over the three years of treatment was 50 percent slower than for a comparison group of patients with homozygous F508del mutations who were not treated with ivacaftor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a post-approval study of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a>, clinical and laboratory data were prospectively collected from 151 subjects prior to and then 1, 3, and 6 months after initiating ivacaftor treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The study confirmed rapid improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> and weight gain, including among individuals with relatively mild disease at baseline. Comparing the six-month periods prior to and after initiation of ivacaftor, the frequency of hospitalizations decreased 19.1 percent and the percent of subjects with at least one positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture decreased 18.8 percent. In addition, ivacaftor treatment improved mucociliary and cough clearance. Finally, duodenal pH increased within one month of ivacaftor treatment, consistent with the role of CFTR as a bicarbonate channel.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Additional mutations </strong>&ndash; In tissue culture experiments, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a> also proved effective at potentiating chloride channel function in cells expressing one of eight additional CFTR gating-type mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These findings prompted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial of 39 CF subjects ages six years and older with a G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, G1349D, or G970R mutation, which showed beneficial results similar to those reported for patients with the G551D mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Additional culture experiments showed that ivacaftor improved CFTR channel function in cells having an R117H mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A randomized double-blind clinical study of ivacaftor in subjects ages six and older with a R117H mutation reported no overall change FEV<sub>1</sub> percent predicted at 24 weeks of therapy (which was the primary outcome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, there were improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> percent predicted in adult patients (who had more advanced disease at study entry compared to children), as well as improvement in sweat chloride concentrations in all age groups. Based on these studies, the FDA expanded approval for ivacaftor beyond the G551D mutation to include those mutations listed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In 2017, the list of FDA-approved mutations was expanded by 23, based primarily on in vitro testing of responsiveness to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116943%7EPEDS%2F113340\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116943 graphicRef113340 \">table 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. The added mutations include some that allow residual CFTR function and are associated with a milder CF phenotype, eg, pancreatic sufficiency. Approximately 10 percent of patients in the CF Foundation patient registry have at least one of the 33 mutations now approved for ivacaftor by the FDA. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Young children</strong> &ndash; Because lung damage in CF often begins in early childhood, studies have been performed to determine whether <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a> is safe for young children. An open-label 24-week study of ivacaftor administered to 34 children age 2 to &lt;6 years found it to have a safety profile similar to that in older age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/16,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,25</a>]. The most common adverse events were cough (56 percent) and vomiting (29 percent). Five patients (15 percent) had elevations in liver enzymes to &gt;8 times the upper limit of normal, requiring interruption of the ivacaftor treatment. Each of these patients had a history of similar elevations prior to ivacaftor and the treatment was successfully resumed in four of the five patients. Although the study was not designed to measure efficacy for CF lung disease, there were significant decreases in sweat chloride (&minus;46.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and increases in body weight. Based on these findings and the efficacy results from studies in older age groups, the FDA approved ivacaftor for CF patients age two years and older who have a G551D or one of the other eligible gating mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113340\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113340 \">table 1B</a>).

A randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 968 stable patients with a forced vital capacity (FVC)&gt;40 percent of predicted values showed that the daily inhalation of 2.5 mg of nebulized DNase (dornase alfa) for six months resulted in a statistically significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of approximately 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. A small but statistically significant reduction in the number of hospital days for exacerbations of respiratory disease was also seen in patients receiving the drug.

A guideline committee of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends the chronic use of DNase for all children with CF older than six years of age, regardless of symptoms or pulmonary function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/45,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,60</a>].

Our practice has been to offer it to all patients who have daily cough and to those with FEV<sub>1</sub> below the normal range.

It is presumed that the high osmolality of the solution draws water from the airway to re-establish the aqueous surface layer that is deficient in CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The effectiveness of this strategy was shown by a study of 24 patients (&ge;14 years of age) with stable CF who were treated with 5 mL of 7 percent saline four times per day for 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The mucus clearance rate was improved after 1 and 14 days of hypertonic saline treatment, and there were modest improvements in lung function and symptom scores. Parallel in vitro studies using cultured monolayers of airway epithelial cells showed that hypertonic saline caused sustained hydration of airway surfaces.</p><p>The medium-term benefit of hypertonic saline was demonstrated by an Australian clinical trial in which 164 patients (&ge;6 years of age) with stable CF were randomly assigned to inhalation therapy with 4 mL of 7 percent saline or 0.9 percent saline following administration of a bronchodilator twice daily for 48 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The study failed to show a statistically significant difference in its primary outcome, namely the rate of change in lung function during the 48-week trial. However, when averaged over the full duration of the study, lung function showed a small, statistically significant improvement in the hypertonic saline group. Patients treated with hypertonic saline had considerably fewer pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy (mean number of exacerbations per participant 0.39 versus 0.89) and fewer days absent from school or work or unable to participate in usual activities (7 versus 24 days). Treatment with hypertonic saline was not associated with worsening bacterial infection or inflammation. The treatment was well tolerated. A systematic review that included this study concluded that hypertonic saline has beneficial effects in patients &ge;6 years of age with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. </p><p>By contrast, hypertonic saline cannot be considered to be part of the routine care of CF children under the age of six years. This was shown in a randomized clinical trial involving 344 subjects between 4 and 60 months of age (Infant Study of Inhaled Saline&nbsp;[ISIS]), which failed to show clinical benefit of inhaling hypertonic saline (7 percent) compared to a control group receiving 0.9 percent saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. There was no benefit in the rate of pulmonary exacerbations (primary endpoint) or any of the secondary endpoints including a respiratory symptom score. As &quot;exploratory&quot; investigations in the ISIS study, infant pulmonary function tests including spirometry using the raised volume technique and lung volumes were performed on a subgroup of the subjects. Of these, only FEV<sub>0.5 </sub>showed a statistically significant improvement (38 mL) in the hypertonic saline group compared with controls. Given the exploratory nature of these tests, the FEV<sub>0.5</sub> result can only be considered hypothesis-generating and not evidence of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. It has been suggested that the endpoints used in the ISIS trial may not have been adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful benefit in young patients with very mild pulmonary disease. Chest computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lung clearance index measurements are undergoing clinical investigations to determine if these are better modalities to detect early changes. </p><p>Additional studies are needed to refine the criteria for use of hypertonic saline in older patients with CF and optimal timing of treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In a study of patient preference, the majority of patients favored inhaling hypertonic saline before or during their chest physiotherapy rather than after [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

Subgroup analysis revealed no difference in the beneficial effects of hypertonic saline between those receiving or not receiving DNase.

Because the mechanisms of action of DNase and hypertonic saline are different, their benefits may well be complementary. The guidelines committee of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation addressed each treatment separately and recommended both for the majority of patients with CF without assigning priority of one over the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. We follow this recommendation but are frequently confronted with situations where a patient will not use both because of cost (DNase costs approximately 30-fold more than hypertonic saline), time required for administration (hypertonic saline is administered twice daily, and DNase once daily), tolerability (DNase typically is better tolerated than hypertonic saline in our experience), or general non-compliance.</p><p>For patients willing and able to use both treatments, the following order of administration is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]: (1) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> by metered dose inhaler, (2) hypertonic saline, (3) chest <span class=\"nowrap\">physiotherapy/exercise</span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dornase-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">DNase</a> in either order, and (4) other inhaled treatments such as aerosolized antibiotics. Inhaled medications should not be mixed together in the same nebulizer because the consequences of doing so are unknown. Of special note is DNase, which is inactivated when mixed with 7 percent saline. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chest physiotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhaled N-acetylcysteine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>N-acetylcysteine, a free sulfhydryl reagent that cleaves disulfide bonds within mucus glycoproteins, can liquefy CF sputum in vitro.

Furthermore, its potential to induce airway inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bronchospasm in a subgroup of patients and to inhibit ciliary function has led to reduction in its use. These deficiencies, in conjunction with its disagreeable odor, relatively high cost, and time required for administration cause us not to prescribe it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEST PHYSIOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retained purulent secretions are an important cause of airflow obstruction and airway injury in CF. In 1950, chest physiotherapy in the form of postural drainage and percussion was introduced to CF care and became the standard method to promote secretion clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. Since that time, secretion clearance programs have been a cornerstone of CF care, although there are no high quality studies that have evaluated their long term benefits compared with no chest physiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Increasingly, methods that can be performed without the aid of another person are replacing the traditional technique in older children and adults. These alternatives include a variety of breathing and coughing techniques such as &quot;autogenic drainage&quot;, &quot;active cycle of breathing&quot;, and &quot;huffing&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. A randomized trial with 36 subjects age 12 to 18 years compared autogenic drainage with postural drainage and percussion and reported no difference in pulmonary function test results, but the subjects strongly preferred the autogenic drainage modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Medical devices of varying cost and complexity have been developed to assist with airway clearance. These include airway oscillating devices, external percussion vests, and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation. </p><p>There are relatively few high-quality clinical trials that evaluate the benefits of chest physiotherapy when performed over extended periods of time or that compare different modalities with each other. A year-long randomized trial in 40 subjects compared postural drainage and percussion with use of a positive expiratory pressure (PEP) mask and found that the PEP mask was associated with significant improvements in pulmonary function compared with postural drainage and percussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. The largest study to date randomized 107 subjects to use a PEP device or a high frequency chest wall oscillation device (a percussion vest) for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. The group using the PEP device experienced significantly fewer pulmonary exacerbations, which was the primary endpoint of the study. No differences were seen in lung function measures, patient satisfaction, or quality of life scores. Finally, a randomized clinical trial with three treatment arms attempted to compare postural drainage and percussion, a flutter device, and a percussion vest. The trial was stopped early for insufficient subject recruitment and high withdrawal rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. High dropout rates have impaired other attempts at randomized trials, probably because subjects often have strong preconceived but unsupported preferences for one treatment arm over another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. </p><p>Based upon strong theoretical reasons why airway secretion clearance should be beneficial and despite the lack of strong evidence-based confirmation, chest physiotherapy remains a pillar of CF pulmonary care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/17,77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,77,78</a>]. We recommend that all patients who produce sputum should be instructed in chest physiotherapy for secretion clearance. Adherence to chest physiotherapy is often poor, particularly among patients with mild disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. Because patients vary in their acceptance and preference for different modes, several techniques should be introduced to each patient. Methods that can be performed without assistance from another person should be included to allow patients to have more control over their regimen. The cost of equipment should be considered, with less expensive modalities prescribed first. More expensive apparatus such as percussion vests may be appropriate for those patients who fail to clear secretions with less expensive methods, who report that the more expensive modalities are effective for them, and who remain adherent with their use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with CF report that they mobilize secretions during aerobic exercise.

Those assigned to the exercise arm of the study lost less forced vital capacity (FVC) compared with the control group. The comparison of change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) showed the same trend (p&lt;0.07). In another clinical trial, 41 subjects of mean age 24.6 years were randomized to participate in a three-month home exercise program or to continue their usual care. The exercise group showed a statistically significant increase in a maximum strength test but had no improvement in a general measure of quality of life or six-minute walk distance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

These results, combined with the known benefits of exercise in healthy individuals, lead to the recommendation that patients with cystic fibrosis should participate in exercise programs (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The benefits and risks of exercise&quot;</a>). There are insufficient data to recommend what specific types of exercise should be included in the program.

A subsequent report, which included patients with and without <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, concluded that even patients who did not demonstrate an improvement in lung function still derived benefit because of a decreased incidence of acute pulmonary exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. These results are in close agreement with three smaller studies that showed similar benefits from macrolides in patients with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-95</a>], and a one-year randomized trial in children with CF that revealed reductions in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations and the need for additional antibiotics, although no change in FEV<sub>1</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. </p><p>One placebo-controlled trial focused only on patients uninfected with <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> or placebo for 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. In this population of relatively healthy patients (mean FEV<sub>1</sub> 97 percent predicted), azithromycin did not improve lung function, as measured by FEV<sub>1</sub>. However, use of azithromycin was associated with clinically important improvements in several exploratory end points, including a 50 percent reduction in pulmonary exacerbations, 27 percent reduction in the initiation of new oral antibiotics (other than azithromycin), 0.58 kg weight gain, and 0.34 unit increase in body mass index (BMI). There were no differences in treatment groups in use of intravenous or inhaled antibiotics or hospitalizations.</p><p>A systematic review that included all of the above studies concluded that six months of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> improves respiratory function in patients with CF and reduces the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. </p><p>The mechanisms by which macrolides improve CF lung disease are uncertain and may involve direct effects on infecting bacteria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suppression of the excessive inflammatory response seen in the CF lung. Macrolides are unable to kill pseudomonas bacteria that are grown under conditions routinely used in clinical microbiology laboratories. However, macrolides have microbicidal activity against pseudomonas bacteria that are grown under conditions that induce biofilm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Furthermore, macrolides can block quorum sensing and reduce the ability of pseudomonas to produce biofilms, which is considered one of the mechanisms by which the bacteria avoid being killed by traditional antipseudomonal antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Independent of their effect on bacteria, there is mounting evidence that macrolides may be beneficial in CF lung disease by suppressing the excessive inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>].</p><p>In our practice, we recommend using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> for all patients with CF older than six years of age regardless of <em>P. aeruginosa </em>infection status who have clinical evidence of airway inflammation such as chronic cough, or who have any reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub>. The guidelines published by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation do not restrict the use of azithromycin to those with evidence of airway inflammation or reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub> as we suggest here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. However, because of limited data on the safety of prolonged use of azithromycin, we recommend delaying its routine use in patients who have negligible evidence of airway disease and whose expected benefit may be minimal. We usually prescribe the medication three times a week, using 250 mg for patients with body weight less than 40 kg, and 500 mg for those over 40 kg. A study in adults shows that 250 mg daily is similarly efficacious, so daily dosing could be used for those patients who find it easier to adhere to a daily treatment schedule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. For the small number of patients who develop gastrointestinal side effects on full dose, a lower dose may be used (eg, 250 mg three times a week for adult-sized patients); this dose reduction was employed in one study and was thought to be of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>Prior to initiating treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>, we recommend that a sputum specimen be examined for nontuberculous mycobacteria; macrolide therapy should NOT be initiated if nontuberculous mycobacteria are present. This is because macrolides are an important component of treatment regimens for Mycobacterium avium complex infection and should be used only as part of a multi-drug regimen, to avoid development of macrolide-resistant mycobacterial species. If smear-negative patients are subsequently positive by culture, the macrolide should be stopped to avoid induction of macrolide resistance. The decision to treat nontuberculous mycobacteria with multiple antibiotics should be based on an assessment of the likelihood that the mycobacteria are causing tissue injury and clinical deterioration, and is discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex lung infection in adults&quot;</a>). In patients without nontuberculous mycobacteria, the use of chronic azithromycin may help to prevent its acquisition: data from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation patient registry showed that the incidence of positive cultures for nontuberculous mycobacteria in CF patients receiving chronic azithromycin therapy was less that the control population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Ibuprofen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the recognition that antiinflammatory glucocorticoids reduce the rate of FEV<sub>1</sub> decline in CF, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> was studied to determine if similar benefits could be obtained without the prohibitive side effects of glucocorticoids.

A registry compiled by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation reports that 840 lung transplants were performed in children with CF from January 2000 through June 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>], and 7419 transplants were performed in adults with CF from January 1995 to June 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision for referral to a lung transplant center is driven by estimates of a patient's predicted survival and quality of life with and without lung transplant. A retrospective study from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Registry, using data that had been collected between 1992 and 1998, concluded that transplantation extends life if performed when the patient has a five-year predicted survival without transplant of less than 30 percent, and possibly when the predicted survival is less than 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. </p><p>Determining when these conditions are met remains challenging. Attempts to use a single indicator (eg, FEV<sub>1</sub> percent predicted &lt;30) to trigger referral have not been sufficiently predictive for use by itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. Analysis using multiple risk factors for reduced survival may improve the accuracy of estimates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>], but the published equations are often generated from data that may not reflect current survival patterns. In 2014, the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) published a list of conditions to be used when considering transplant referral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>]. Importantly, the publication stressed that the decision should not be driven by a single parameter but by the patient's entire clinical picture. Based in part on the ISHLT consensus report, we recommend that the following factors should be used in considering the timing for referral to a lung transplant center: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FEV<sub>1</sub> that has fallen to 30 percent of predicted values. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly falling FEV<sub>1</sub> despite optimal therapy in a patient with advanced lung disease, eg, an FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;40 percent predicted, particularly in a female patient or in one with CF-related diabetes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A six-minute walk distance &lt;400 meters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of pulmonary hypertension in the absence of a hypoxemic exacerbation (as defined by a systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) &gt;35 mm Hg on echocardiography or mean PAP &gt;25 mm Hg measured by right heart catheterization).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical decline characterized by increasing frequency of exacerbations associated with any of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An episode of acute respiratory failure requiring noninvasive ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A pattern of poor clinical recovery from successive exacerbations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Worsening nutritional status despite supplementation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pneumothorax, particularly when recurrent or difficult to resolve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Life-threatening hemoptysis despite bronchial artery embolization.</p><p/><p>Since 2005, in the United States, the position of each individual lung transplant candidate on the priority list for transplant is determined by a lung allocation score (LAS) formulated by UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing). The score is based on lung diagnosis, age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, supplemental oxygen use, six-minute walk distance, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, serum creatinine functional status, and need for assisted ventilation. Details about the scoring system are available from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>]. The scoring system is adjusted periodically to incorporate new data that improve the estimate of one-year survival with and without transplantation. A study from a single center found that integrating a health-related quality of life measure might improve the estimation of mortality when computing a transplant priority score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. As expected, an analysis of UNOS data found that survival of those transplanted with very high LAS was worse than those with lower scores at the time of transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>]. </p><p>There are wide variations in the length of waiting lists among transplant centers, and individual patients may be served by exploring a number of different lung transplant centers. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, most commonly venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), have been used to bridge patients to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation'</a> above.) </p><p>Patients with CF rarely become candidates for lung transplantation prior to 12 years of age.

Due to limited availability of age-matched lungs for children, particularly for those below the age of 12, UNOS broadened their policy so that lungs from adolescent donors are preferentially allocated to pediatric recipients. Under the prior policy, organs from adolescent donors had been allocated preferentially to adults or adolescents based on LAS scores. Simulation modeling indicated that the new policy should improve organ availability for children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each transplant center has its own list of relative and absolute contraindications for lung transplantation. In addition to the general contraindications for lung transplantation applicable for all disease indications, there are several CF-specific considerations. Chronic infection with <em>Burkholderia cenocepacia </em>connotes a worse prognosis following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/153-156\" class=\"abstract_t\">153-156</a>]. Most, but not all, transplant centers consider infection with this organism to be a contraindication to the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>]. Other species of <em>Burkholderia</em> do not appear to have the same adverse effects, with the possible exception of <em>Burkholderia gladioli</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/153-156\" class=\"abstract_t\">153-156</a>]. Patients infected with multidrug-resistant <em>P. aeruginosa</em> have slightly worse survival following lung transplant compared with those infected with drug-sensitive <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, but the decrement is minor; their survival is similar to that of patients undergoing lung transplantation for non-CF diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]. Those infected with <em>Mycobacterium abscessus</em> frequently develop post-transplant complications and should be evaluated by centers with experience managing this infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>].

The survival of these patients without transplantation is poor, and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays are associated with progressive deconditioning of affected individuals, another strong contraindication to transplantation in many centers. In addition, their poor clinical status prohibits education and informed consent of the patient, who is expected to adhere to a post-transplant regimen that is complex and can be onerous.</p><p>Symptomatic osteoporosis is a relative contraindication for lung transplantation in general, but it takes on special significance for patients with CF. The frequency of <span class=\"nowrap\">osteopenia/osteoporosis</span> in CF increases with age and affects about 20 percent of individuals in the 18- to 25-year age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Thus, pre-symptomatic diagnosis and treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">osteopenia/osteoporosis</span> is important to avoid exclusion of a patient from consideration for transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among adult patients with CF who underwent lung transplantation between 1990 and 2013, the median (50 percent) survival was 8.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>], which is significantly better than the survival for patients who are transplanted for other disease indications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65977\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65977 \">figure 3</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: An overview&quot;</a>). Reports of survival data from single centers restricting the analysis to more recent experience suggest that survival may be improving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/161,162\" class=\"abstract_t\">161,162</a>]. Pediatric patients receiving lung transplants for CF had a 50 percent survival of 5.2 years, which is not significantly different from the 5.3 year median survival for pediatric patients who were transplanted for other indications, but is lower than that of adults with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>].</p><p>The benefits of lung transplantation in CF have been assessed using retrospective data from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Registry.

The procedure does not address the non-pulmonary problems associated with CF. Chronic sinusitis, cirrhosis, cholelithiasis, pancreatic insufficiency, CF-associated diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome that remain causes of morbidity and occasionally of mortality. Pancreatic insufficiency and abnormalities in bowel motility can make <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> absorption and dosing difficult; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> itself is diabetogenic; glucocorticoid treatment to suppress graft rejection complicates diabetic management and accelerates osteoporosis.

The overall mortality rate during delivery was 1 percent. In addition to the underlying pulmonary disease, comorbidities that may complicate pregnancies include cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, cardiac conduction disorders, acute renal failure, and <span class=\"nowrap\">thrombophilia/antiphospholipid</span> syndrome. Severe lung disease, especially when pulmonary hypertension is present, is a bad prognostic indicator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>], although successful outcomes have been reported in a few women who had severe impairment of lung function prior to conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>].

Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is an important tool for managing massive hemoptysis, and should be implemented promptly.

Exacerbations are treated with antibiotics, given either orally, via inhalation, or intravenously, depending on the infecting organisms and the severity of the exacerbation. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of CF lung disease is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with CF should undergo cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) genotyping to determine if they carry one of the mutations approved for CFTR modulator therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116943%7EPEDS%2F113340\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116943 graphicRef113340 \">table 1A-B</a>).

Dosing is based on age and body weight.

Initial clinical trials demonstrated modest improvements in pulmonary function, reduced frequency of pulmonary exacerbations in F508del homozygotes, and no significant adverse effects. Tezacaftor-ivacaftor also has fewer drug interactions compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumacaftor-and-ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lumacaftor-ivacaftor</a>. (See <a href=\"#H1940708902\" class=\"local\">'Tezacaftor-ivacaftor for homozygous F508del and residual function mutations'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with CF between six and 12 years of age who are homozygous for F508del, we suggest using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumacaftor-and-ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lumacaftor-ivacaftor</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, drug interactions should be considered when deciding on its use. This treatment yields modest improvements in pulmonary function and reduces the risk of pulmonary exacerbations. We suggest that patients 12 years and older who are currently on lumacaftor-ivacaftor be switched to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tezacaftor-and-ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tezacaftor-ivacaftor</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), due to its slightly greater improvement in pulmonary function, and fewer adverse effects and drug interactions. (See <a href=\"#H1066239299\" class=\"local\">'Lumacaftor-ivacaftor for F508del'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest using short-acting inhaled beta-2-adrenergic receptor agonists for patients with CF prior to inhalation of hypertonic saline, antibiotics, or initiating chest physiotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We also suggest chronic use of these agents if there is evidence that they improve expiratory flow rates in those with baseline airflow obstruction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Bronchodilators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend chronic treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dornase-alfa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">DNase</a> I (dornase alfa) for children with moderate to severe CF lung disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We also suggest treatment for patients with mild or asymptomatic lung disease, but the quality of evidence and likely clinical benefit are lower for this group (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Inhaled DNase I (dornase alfa)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend chronic treatment with hypertonic saline via nebulizer for patients six years and older who have a chronic cough and any reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We also suggest it may be of benefit for patients in this age group with milder disease manifestations (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). A typical treatment regimen is 4 mL of 7 percent saline following administration of a bronchodilator twice daily. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Inhaled hypertonic saline'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that all patients who produce sputum be treated with a form of physiotherapy for mucus clearance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This suggestion is based on demonstrated benefits to secretion clearance with the use of a variety of methods of physiotherapy, including aerobic exercise. However, it should be recognized that long-term improvement in clinical outcome has not been shown. Because patients vary in their responses to different modes, several techniques should be introduced to each patient. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chest physiotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend the chronic use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> for patients six years and older who have clinical evidence of airway inflammation such as chronic cough or any reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub>, regardless of the patient's <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection status (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). To avoid induction of antibiotic resistance, azithromycin should not be given to patients infected with nontuberculous mycobacteria. This drug slows decline of lung function, likely through antiinflammatory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antibacterial effects. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Macrolide antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treatment with high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> in children and young adolescents with good lung function (&gt;60 percent predicted) in whom there is no contraindication to this therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The evidence base for this practice is limited to a few studies, and there is inadequate evidence to support this suggestion for adult patients or for patients with poor lung function. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Ibuprofen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with CF but without asthma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, we recommend AGAINST treating with inhaled corticosteroids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). For this group, there are no clear benefits, and the treatment may impair linear growth. For patients with CF and asthma, inhaled corticosteroids have greater clinical benefit, and the treatment may be considered along with other antiasthmatic treatments. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Inhaled glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children and adolescents with CF, we recommend AGAINST chronic treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Although there is a slight benefit to lung function, these do not outweigh the adverse effects on growth, glucose metabolism, and cataract risk for most patients. In adults, we also suggest AGAINST chronic treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Systemic glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of supplemental oxygen to treat chronic hypoxemia has not been studied in patients with CF. In the absence of such evidence, it is reasonable to extrapolate from the benefits demonstrated for this treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to apply the same indications for its chronic use. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Supplemental oxygen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe CF lung disease is a common indication for lung transplantation, and outcomes are better than those of patients undergoing lung transplantation for other indications. Chronic infection with <em>Burkholderia cenocepacia </em>connotes a worse prognosis following transplantation and is often considered a contraindication to the procedure.
