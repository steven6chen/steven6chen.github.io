These studies revealed that a transferrin saturation (serum iron concentration &divide; total iron binding capacity) greater than 60 percent in men and over 50 percent in women identified the presence of an abnormality in iron metabolism with approximately 95 percent accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following this observation, population screening using these cutoff values for transferrin saturation showed that the frequency of heterozygotes is approximately 10 percent in Caucasian populations in the United States and western Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>], with a frequency of approximately 5 per 1000 (0.5 percent) for the homozygous state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. The prevalence was higher (approximately 1 percent) in a screening study that assumed that 60 percent of patients with an elevated transferrin saturation but normal serum ferritin had early HH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is now known that the vast majority of patients so diagnosed were homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE protein.

However, other gene defects leading to HH have been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56329 \">table 1</a>). This subject is discussed in depth separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Other gene defects leading to iron overload or high ferritin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">African Americans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A disorder of iron overload with the clinical and liver biopsy features of HH has been described in four African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The pathophysiology of this disorder was not determined; the cellular and tissue distribution of iron was different from that in typical HLA-linked HH. It has been suggested that a gene affecting iron metabolism that is distinct from HFE may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Whether this gene is related to the one predisposing to African iron overload is not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron is normally lost in sweat, shed skin cells, and the gastrointestinal tract at a rate of approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Premenopausal adult women lose an additional 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> because of menses. These losses are usually balanced by the absorption of 10 percent of the 10 to 20 mg of iron in the diet in Western societies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-iron-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of iron balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Homozygous HH is characterized by increased absorption of both heme and non-heme iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In contrast to normal subjects, the absorption of non-heme iron in HH is not regulated by iron stores. This leads to progressive iron accumulation because there is no normal mechanism for excretion of excess iron once it has been absorbed into the body. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Role in iron absorption'</a>.)</p><p>A few simple calculations explain why clinical manifestations of HH typically occur after age 40 in males and later in females. A male patient with homozygous HH absorbs 2 to 4 mg of iron per day, rather than the 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> needed to balance iron losses. Suppose that a patient absorbs 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. The retention of 3 mg of iron more per day than is needed to maintain iron balance will lead to net iron accumulation of approximately 1 g per year. If there are no other major needs for iron following the adolescent growth spurt, it will not be until age 40 or 50 that total iron accumulation will reach more than 20 g of iron. Patients with this degree of iron overload are poised to develop the clinical features of HH described below. On the other hand, women become symptomatic later in life because of the extra iron losses associated with menses, pregnancy, and lactation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of HH are related to excessive iron deposition in tissues, especially the liver, heart, pancreas, and pituitary. The retained iron is primarily deposited in parenchymal cells, with reticuloendothelial cell accumulation occurring very late in the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This is in contrast to transfusional iron overload, in which iron deposition occurs first in the reticuloendothelial cells and then in parenchymal cells.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of iron accumulation include liver disease, skin pigmentation, diabetes mellitus, arthropathy, impotence in males, and cardiac enlargement with or without heart failure or conduction defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60117\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60117 \">table 2</a>). One report, for example, evaluated 251 patients diagnosed with HH from 1959 to 1992. The following abnormalities were noted at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver function abnormalities &ndash; 75 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness and lethargy &ndash; 74 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin hyperpigmentation &ndash; 70 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus &ndash; 48 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthralgia &ndash; 44 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impotence in males &ndash; 45 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiographic abnormalities &ndash; 31 percent</p><p/><p>In another report that involved 2851 respondents to a survey, symptoms had been present for an average of 10 years before diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The most common symptoms were extreme fatigue (46 percent), arthralgia (44 percent), and loss of libido (26 percent). The pathophysiologic mechanisms behind the symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and lethargy are unclear. Of interest, in some patients these symptoms may only minimally improve following successful phlebotomy and removal of excess iron.</p><p>Skin hyperpigmentation reflects a combination of iron deposition and melanin. The classic triad of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and skin pigmentation (&quot;bronze diabetes&quot;) occurs late in the disease, at a time when the total body iron content has reached as much as 20 g (greater than five times normal).</p><p>However, the presentation of HH has changed, since most patients are currently diagnosed when elevated ferritin levels or increased transferrin saturation are noted on a routine chemistry screening panel or screening is performed because of a relative diagnosed with HH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. In two studies, approximately 75 percent of such patients were asymptomatic at presentation, with a low incidence (&lt;25 percent) of cirrhosis, diabetes, or skin hyperpigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. As a result, correlations between the various HH genotypes on the one hand, and clinical findings (eg, incidence of liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, porphyria cutanea tarda, diabetes, arthritis) on the other, are of uncertain significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A third study evaluated 214 relatives with homozygous HH who were first diagnosed as the result of family screening during follow-up of 291 homozygous probands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The relatives were evaluated for the presence of iron overload and disease-related conditions (cirrhosis, hepatic fibrosis, elevated aminotransferase levels, and hemochromatotic arthropathy). Iron overload was present in 85 and 68 percent of the men and women, respectively, while the incidence of disease-related conditions was 38 and 10 percent, respectively. If the proband had a disease-related condition, relatives who were men were more likely to have morbidity than if the proband had no disease-related condition. These observations highlight the importance of early diagnosis for the patient as well as for any previously undiagnosed affected relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive iron deposition in the liver is associated with hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and the eventual development of increasing fibrosis and cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Reversibility of these changes following therapeutic iron removal is more likely early in the course of the disease, but can occur even in patients with cirrhosis and varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>As an example, in one report of 120 patients with cirrhosis and HH and 120 patients with postnecrotic cirrhosis, 25 percent had varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Therapeutic phlebotomy was associated with improvement or reversal of varices in 26 percent of patients with HH versus 5 percent in those with postnecrotic cirrhosis. Worsening portal hypertension in the patients with HH was associated with coexistent viral hepatic infection (eg, hepatitis B and C) in 16 of 22 cases.</p><p>Although the number of patients studied to date is small, the presence of HH-induced iron overload may also have a potentiating effect on hepatic fibrosis in patients with HH accompanied by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], similar to that seen in iron overloaded patients with thalassemia major and HCV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hepatic-fibrosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Fibrogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thalassemia: Management after hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Liver disease'</a>.)</p><p>All patients with HH and cirrhosis should undergo diagnostic endoscopy to document the presence of varices and to determine their risk for variceal hemorrhage. Patients at high risk for development of variceal hemorrhage should be considered for primary prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary and pre-primary prophylaxis against variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8330122\"><span class=\"h3\">Alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excess alcohol intake is a major risk factor for the development of liver disease in patients with HH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Conversely, iron overload in HH potentiates the development of alcoholic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. This effect may be related to iron's ability to act as an electron donor, which accelerates the generation of unstable reactive oxygen intermediates, leading to enhanced membrane injury. Increased free radical formation may also hasten the generation of neutrophil chemoattractants, which further augment the inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Thus, hepatic fibrosis can occur in some subjects with HH and normal levels of serum transaminases. On the other hand, many subjects with HH also have an accompanying inflammatory liver condition (eg, hepatic steatosis, alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B or C) with higher median transaminase levels than those with HH unaccompanied by hepatic steatosis or other inflammatory liver disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p>As an example, in one retrospective study of 200 patients with documented HH, 43 percent had at least one additional cause of chronic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Those with HH and an additional cause of chronic liver disease were significantly more likely to have elevated aminotransferase levels than those with HH and no other cause of liver disease (47 versus 18 percent, respectively).</p><p>The above observations have a strong impact on making the diagnosis of HH and can be stated as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HH is tenable even if transaminase levels are normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with HH commonly have an additional cause of chronic inflammatory liver disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic screening for HH should always be considered in patients with known chronic inflammatory liver disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatocellular carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most serious complications of excess hepatic iron deposition, is responsible for approximately 45 percent of all deaths in patients with HH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>].</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated an increased risk of HCC in patients with HH, with estimates of the magnitude of risk ranging from a 20- to 200-fold increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/33,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36-38</a>]. One of the largest population-based studies to address this issue estimated that the risk was increased approximately 20-fold compared with the general population (95% CI 16-22) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The defect appears to be relatively selective for the pancreatic beta cell; insulin and C-peptide secretion are reduced, but alpha cell function seems to be intact as evidenced by increased serum glucagon levels similar to those seen in type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

These patients may have elevated serum iron studies without significantly elevated hepatic iron burdens. This issue was evaluated in a study that included 66 patients with HH and 132 patients with other liver diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. All patients underwent routine blood chemistries, <em>HFE</em> genotype determination, and liver biopsy. The majority of patients with HH diagnosed on the basis of iron studies and liver biopsy (91 percent) were C282Y homozygotes, including six patients in whom HH had not been originally suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

Since alcohol is one of the strongest exacerbating factors in HH, its abuse should always be suspected and appropriate inquiries made into quantitating the patient's use of alcoholic beverages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].
