Compared with proliferative endometrium, there is an increase in the endometrial gland-to-stroma ratio. Endometrial hyperplasia frequently results from chronic estrogen stimulation unopposed by the counterbalancing effects of progesterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The classification, epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and evaluation of endometrial hyperplasia are reviewed here.

The proliferating glands vary in size and shape, and cells may have cytologic atypia.</p><p>The terminology for abnormal proliferation of the endometrium has varied. Terms that have been used include: &quot;adenomatous hyperplasia,&quot; &quot;atypical hyperplasia,&quot; and &quot;carcinoma in situ.&quot; Some, but not all, of these lesions represent endometrial carcinoma precursors. The diagnosis of these proliferative lesions is poorly reproducible because it is difficult to distinguish between non-neoplastic proliferations and neoplastic proliferations, and it is difficult to determine endometrial invasion in a nonhysterectomy specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, pathologists use &quot;surrogate&quot; markers of invasion, such as back-to-back glands and cribriform glands.</p><p>The two main classification systems for endometrial hyperplasia are the 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) system and the endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia system. The WHO system is more widely used. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1994367756\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification systems</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H506961\"><span class=\"h3\">World Health Organization classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2015 WHO endometrial hyperplasia classification system has only two categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperplasia without atypia (non-neoplastic)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical hyperplasia (endometrial intraepithelial neoplasm)</p><p/><p>Previously, the 1994 WHO classification of endometrial hyperplasia had been the most widely used system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The 1994 WHO classification of endometrial hyperplasia had four categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simple hyperplasia without atypia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex hyperplasia without atypia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simple atypical hyperplasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex atypical hyperplasia</p><p/><p>The 1994 WHO system correlated with the risk of progression to endometrial carcinoma. However, a significant limitation was interobserver variability across pathologists reviewing the same slides (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109743 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. The finding of nuclear atypia, the most important predictor of progression to (or concurrent) carcinoma, has relatively poor interobserver agreement. As an example, in one study, among unblinded academic pathologists the correlation coefficient of nuclear atypia was 0.28 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although numerous pathology features are used to diagnose endometrial hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], an independent review by five pathologists showed that only the presence of nucleoli was associated with high agreement in the distinction of atypical hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Interobserver variability improves with increasing specimen volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/4,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,8</a>].</p><p>The 2015 WHO system is intended to reduce the confusion associated with numerous pathologic terms, and also to reflect that hyperplasia without atypia is a non-neoplastic change. By contrast, hyperplasia with atypia has been found to exhibit many cellular and genetic changes that are typically associated with invasive carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Pathologic features of the 1994 and 2015 WHO classification schemes that are described include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal endometrium &ndash; During the normal menstrual cycle, endometrium is proliferative during the follicular phase and is secretory during the luteal phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62189 \">figure 1</a>). Normal proliferative endometrium exhibits no crowding of glands within the stroma (&lt;50 percent ratio of glands to stroma). Normal secretory endometrium may have &gt;50 percent gland-to-stroma ratio. Although secretory phase glands exhibit crowding, they are organized, and cells comprising the glands are spaced and are not mitotically active. Normal proliferative and secretory endometrium is shown in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67488%7EOBGYN%2F76588\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67488 graphicRef76588 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simple versus complex hyperplasia &ndash; Historically, simple and complex endometrial hyperplasia were characterized by the following features. This distinction is no longer made in the 2015 WHO classification system:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Simple hyperplasia consists of glands that are mildly crowded. They are frequently cystically dilated with only occasional outpouching. Mitoses are typically present in the glandular cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73789\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73789 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complex hyperplasia consists of glands that are crowded (&gt;50 percent gland to stroma ratio); the gland-to-stroma ratio is higher in complex hyperplasia compared to simple hyperplasia. The glands appear disorganized and have luminal outpouching. Mitoses are typically present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57406\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57406 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nuclear atypia &ndash; Nuclear atypia is the presence of nuclear enlargement; the chromatin may be either evenly dispersed or clumped, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prominent nucleoli may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Gland crowding lined by atypical cells is the hallmark of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66592\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66592 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80373\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80373 \">picture 5</a>). Rarely, extreme complexity <strong>without</strong> marked cytologic atypia warrants a diagnosis of atypical hyperplasia. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) classification system was proposed by an international group of gynecologic pathologists in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The EIN system has not gained widespread acceptance, most likely due to cost <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lack of experience with the computerized D-scoring component.</p><p>The D-score is an integral part of the EIN classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. It is a measure of stromal volume as a proportion of total tissue volume (stroma + epithelium + gland lumen). Using this method, specimens are classified as benign (D &gt;1), indeterminate (0&lt; D &lt;1), or EIN (D &lt;0). The D-score is assigned based on evaluation with computerized morphometry.</p><p>A potential alternative to computerized morphometry is subjective EIN classification. This approach appeared to correlate well with estimates using the computerized D-score in one small study of 97 women in which 8 women developed cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, more experience is needed to evaluate subjective assignment of the D-score in diverse practice environments.</p><p>The EIN system defines two classes of endometrial changes: benign and intraepithelial neoplasia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign endometrial hyperplasia (EH, non-neoplastic) &ndash; Changes typically observed with anovulation or other etiology of prolonged exposure to estrogen. The morphology of EH varies from proliferative endometrium with a few cysts (persistent proliferative endometrium) to bulkier endometria with many dilated and contorted glands that in other systems have been designated as &quot;cystic glandular hyperplasia,&quot; &quot;mild hyperplasia,&quot; or &quot;simple hyperplasia.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) &ndash; Endometrial precancers. Epithelial crowding in EIN displaces stroma to a point at which stromal volume is less than approximately half of total tissue volume in nonsecretory endometrium, and typically cells appear morphologically clonal and distinct from the surrounding endometrium.</p><p/><p>EIN classification categories do not correspond directly to specific categories in the WHO system, but there is some consistency. Most simple and nonatypical complex hyperplasias fall into the EH category. Some complex hyperplasias without atypia and essentially all complex hyperplasias with atypia fall into the EIN category.</p><p>The EIN classification system has demonstrated moderate interobserver reproducibility (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109743 \">table 1</a>), and studies have confirmed that EIN correlates with progression to endometrial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>].</p><p>A recognized drawback of the EIN system is that it lumps findings that would receive different treatments (hormonal treatment or surgery), ostensibly because of the lack of ability to reproducibly distinguish between differing severities within the EIN category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8943236\"><span class=\"h3\">Comparing the WHO and EIN systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies have compared the diagnostic performance of the WHO and EIN systems. The largest population-based observational study with 138 women who developed endometrial carcinoma suggested that the EIN and 1994 WHO classification systems were similarly effective for predicting progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. A smaller multicenter study that was not population-based suggested that the EIN system was better able to distinguish between lesions likely to progress versus those not likely to progress, but caution is warranted in the interpretation of these findings as only 24 women with cancer were included.</p><p>The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists recommend using a pathologic diagnosis system that utilizes criteria and terminology that distinguish between clinicopathologic entities requiring different management.&nbsp;The EIN system may better fulfill these objectives, but adequate comparative studies are lacking.&nbsp;The WHO classification remains more widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>The risk of progression to endometrial carcinoma using the WHO and EIN classification systems was found to be similar in a nested case-control study. Using 138 cases of endometrial carcinoma, the relative risk of carcinoma was 9.19 for atypical hyperplasia and 7.76 for intraepithelial neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The risk of progression using the EIN system was also evaluated in a multicenter study: 24 of 477 women developed endometrial carcinoma at least one year after their index biopsy. The progression rate was 2.3 percent among women without atypia and 13 percent among women with atypia. Using the EIN scoring scheme, 19 percent with EIN showed progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1281223960\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinguishing hyperplasia from endometrial carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is sometimes difficult to distinguish a precursor lesion (EIN) from endometrial carcinoma. Atypical hyperplasia or EIN is distinguished from grade 1 endometrial carcinoma by findings that suggest invasion, including: invasive pattern of glands infiltrating reactive stroma (the most definitive), cribriform glands, or confluent growth (lack of stroma between glands). Marked nuclear atypia, especially in the context of atrophic background endometrium, may be present in either endometrial intraepithelial serous neoplasm or &quot;intraepithelial carcinoma,&quot; which is frequently associated with invasive serous carcinoma. </p><p>Variability is often noted across pathologists in distinguishing atypical <span class=\"nowrap\">hyperplasia/endometrial</span> intraepithelial neoplasia from carcinoma. As an example, in one study, 289 endometrial sampling specimens with a diagnosis of complex atypical hyperplasia made at a community hospital were reviewed by unblinded pathologists using 1994 WHO criteria; 25 percent of cases were downgraded to less severe histology than complex atypical hyperplasia, and 29 percent were upgraded to endometrial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1443043741\"><span class=\"h3\">Potential biomarker use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Considerable progress has been made in the evaluation of immunohistochemical markers to distinguish atypical hyperplasia from endometrial carcinoma. Two small pathology reviews noted that the absence of <em>PAX2</em> expression on immunohistochemistry was helpful in delineating EIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], especially when there was a background of secretory endometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. <em>PAX2</em> alterations were noted to correlate well with EIN, but were less useful with the WHO classification.</p><p>As an example, in a blind review of 206 endometrial samples, the percentage of cases with complete <em>PAX2</em> loss (no cells staining) increased with increasing severity of hyperplasia: normal proliferative and secretory (no cases), simple hyperplasia (17.4 percent), complex hyperplasia (59 percent), atypical hyperplasia (74.1 percent), and grade 1 endometrioid carcinomas (73.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Another small immunohistochemistry assessment noted that various clusters of proteins, including MMP-9 and BCL-2 overexpression and estrogen and progesterone receptor underexpression, were useful to differentiate endometrial carcinoma from atypical endometrial hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H400717310\"><span class=\"h2\">Squamous morules and atypical polyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squamous morules are seen in non-neoplastic and neoplastic endometrial processes, though they are more commonly observed in neoplasms. Women with isolated morules on sampling should be carefully followed to exclude an under-sampled or occult neoplastic glandular lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Most endometrial polyps do not contain neoplasm. However, there can be polypoid neoplasms or neoplasms (endometrioid carcinoma or complex atypical hyperplasia or serous neoplasm) involving polyps. If <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasm/cells</span> suggestive of neoplasm are present in association with a biopsy, it may not be certain whether that neoplasm is confined to the polyp, and therefore further treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hysterectomy may be warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H761853512\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with neoplastic endometrial hyperplasia may have coexistent endometrial carcinoma or may progress to carcinoma. Using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the presence of nuclear atypia in endometrial hyperplasia is the most important indicator for the risk of coexisting carcinoma or progression. Women at the highest risk include those with: atypical endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) or and those with complex hyperplasia who have significant risk factors for endometrial carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62089 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1321384920\"><span class=\"h2\">Coexistent carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A literature review including 2572 patients reported that 37 percent of women with a diagnosis of atypical endometrial hyperplasia on endometrial sampling were found to have endometrial carcinoma on subsequent biopsy or hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Trends in incidence over the accrual period demonstrated declining incidence over time, particularly for atypical hyperplasia (1985 to 1989: 23 per 100,000 woman-years versus 2000 to 2003: 5 per 100,000 woman-years). The reason for this trend is unknown. However, at the time the investigation was performed, postmenopausal hormone therapy was common practice, and in 1985 at the beginning of the study, unopposed estrogen was commonly used; whereas from 1995 to 2003, the importance of adding progestin therapy to postmenopausal estrogen to minimize endometrial neoplasia was widely accepted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis from another large health plan from 1980 to 2003 found that the rate of endometrial hyperplasia only (without hysterectomy or cancer) declined by almost six-fold during the study period, from 852.8 per 100,000 in 1980 to 144.0 per 100,000 in 2002; rates of endometrial hyperplasia declined until 1999, but then the incidence increased, possibly due increasing rates of obesity, which is a risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia are similar to those for endometrial carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62089 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Most of these risk factors involve exposure of the endometrium to continuous estrogen unopposed by a progestin. This effect may be due to endogenous or exogenous hormone.</p><p>Physiologically, estrogen stimulates endometrial proliferation during the normal menstrual cycle; this effect is buffered by progesterone, which inhibits endometrial proliferation and stimulates differentiation in preparation for implantation of an embryo.</p><p>In addition, women with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) are at a greatly increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia.

Among premenopausal women, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and chronic anovulation are commonly associate factors. Occasionally, in women with no abnormal uterine bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia is detected via abnormal glandular or endometrial cells on cervical cytology.</p><p>The clinical presentation for endometrial hyperplasia is the same as for endometrial carcinoma.

Pelvic sonography may also be performed to evaluate for other etiologies of abnormal uterine bleeding or to assess endometrial thickness in postmenopausal women; however, ultrasound criteria have been set for detection of endometrial carcinoma, but not endometrial hyperplasia. Endometrial thickness is not a reliable test for endometrial neoplasia in premenopausal women.

In particular, patients with risk factors for endometrial carcinoma should have repeat sampling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62089\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62089 \">table 2</a>). A nested case-control study of patients with an endometrial carcinoma diagnosis who had previous benign endometrial sampling showed a personal history of colorectal cancer, endometrial polyp, and morbid obesity were independently associated with the subsequent diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Transvaginal ultrasound, sonohysterography, or diagnostic hysteroscopy should be performed to exclude structural lesions (leiomyomas, endometrial polyps).

Neoplastic endometrial hyperplasia is characterized by a proliferation of endometrial glands that may progress to or coexist with endometrial carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly used classification system for endometrial hyperplasia has been the 1994 World Health Organization (WHO) system, which has four categories: simple without nuclear atypia, complex without atypia, simple atypical hyperplasia, and complex atypical hyperplasia. The new 2015 WHO classification system has two categories: hyperplasia without atypia (non-neoplastic) and atypical hyperplasia (endometrial intraepithelial neoplasm). (See <a href=\"#H506961\" class=\"local\">'World Health Organization classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia system is another classification system and uses a D score. It is a measure of stromal volume as a proportion of total tissue volume (stroma + epithelium + gland lumen). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of nuclear atypia is the most important indicator of the risk of endometrial carcinoma in women with endometrial hyperplasia. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish a precursor lesion from endometrial carcinoma. Approximately 17 to 48 percent of women with atypical hyperplasia are found to have coexistent endometrial carcinoma when a hysterectomy is performed. (See <a href=\"#H1321384920\" class=\"local\">'Coexistent carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial <span class=\"nowrap\">hyperplasia/intraepithelial</span> endometrioid neoplasm commonly results from excess estrogen and progesterone imbalance. This may be caused by obesity, anovulation, estrogen therapy without a progestin, or estrogen-producing ovarian tumors (rare). Women with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch syndrome are at high risk for endometrial neoplasia.
