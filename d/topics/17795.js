HCAP referred to pneumonia acquired in healthcare facilities such as nursing homes, hemodialysis centers, and outpatient clinics or during a hospitalization within the past three months. However, HCAP was not included in the 2016 guidelines because there is increasing evidence that many patients with HCAP are not, in fact, at high risk for MDR pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>] and because this designation is not a good predictor of who will have an infection with an MDR organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Interaction with the healthcare system is potentially a risk factor for MDR pathogens, but underlying patient characteristics are also important independent determinants of risk for MDR pathogens and mortality. In addition, there is no evidence to indicate that treating patients with HCAP according to the recommendations in HAP guidelines improves outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Recommendations regarding coverage for MDR pathogens for pneumonia patients admitted to a hospital should ideally be based upon validated risk factors for MDR pathogens, not only on whether or not the patient had previous contacts with the healthcare system. For this reason, it is anticipated that patients previously designated as HCAP will be included in the next update of the <span class=\"nowrap\">IDSA/ATS</span> community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines because patients with HCAP frequently present from the community and are initially cared for in emergency departments. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gram-negative pathogens'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Multidrug resistance'</a> below.)</p><p>For these reasons, we feel that patients previously classified as having HCAP should be managed in a similar way to those with CAP, with the need for therapy targeting MDR pathogens being considered on a case-by-case basis. Specific risk factors for resistance that should be assessed include recent receipt of antimicrobials, comorbidities, functional status, and severity of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) gram-negative bacilli are defined by resistance to all commonly used systemic antibiotics except <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tigecycline</a>, and aminoglycosides.

All hospitals should regularly create and disseminate a local antibiogram, ideally one that is specific to their intensive care unit population(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for multidrug resistance are discussed separately.

Choice of a specific regimen for empiric therapy should be based upon knowledge of the prevailing pathogens (and susceptibility patterns) within the healthcare setting as well as the individual patient's risk factors for multidrug resistance and prior microbiology data. A good quality Gram stain can also be useful for guiding the choice of initial therapy.</p><p>The recommendations below are generally in keeping with the 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America <span class=\"nowrap\">(IDSA)/American</span> Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines on the management of HAP and VAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1805039807\" class=\"local\">'Society guideline links'</a> below). Knowledge of the predominant pathogens, and particularly their susceptibility patterns, should greatly impact the choice of empiric therapy; in some cases, the regimens differ from those recommended in the <span class=\"nowrap\">IDSA/ATS</span> guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249925653\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once HAP or VAP is suspected clinically, antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In patients with sepsis or septic shock, antibiotics should be started within one hour. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults#H1633281939\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Empiric antibiotic therapy (first hour)'</a>.)</p><p>Delaying treatment and failing to give a regimen with activity against the causative pathogens are both associated with higher mortality rates in patients with VAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. However, broader regimens and longer treatment courses increase the risks of adverse drug effects, <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infections, and antimicrobial resistance. An appropriate compromise is to pair early and aggressive treatment with early and aggressive deescalation. Establishing the diagnosis of HAP and VAP can be difficult, especially those in whom clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic findings can be due to numerous etiologies besides pneumonia. The difficulty in diagnosis may lead to overtreatment with its attendant risks of superinfection and antibiotic toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Empiric treatment choices should be influenced by the local distribution of pathogens causing HAP and VAP and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As noted above, all hospitals should regularly create and disseminate a local antibiogram, ideally one that is specific to their intensive care unit (ICU) population(s). In addition to awareness of local pathogen distribution, antimicrobial selection should also be based upon risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20</a>], including recent antibiotic therapy (if any), the presence of underlying diseases, and available culture data (interpreted with care). For patients with risk factors for MDR pathogens, empiric broad-spectrum multidrug therapy is recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109530\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109530 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109531\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109531 \">table 2</a>). Additional considerations include potential toxicities, potential drug interactions, cost, availability, and clinician familiarity with the medications. Once the results of pretherapy cultures are available, therapy should be narrowed based upon the susceptibility pattern of the pathogens identified and the potential toxicities of the regimens. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Multidrug resistance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Specific antimicrobial considerations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H165911201\" class=\"local\">'Potential toxicities'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1976715513\" class=\"local\">'Deescalation'</a> below.)</p><p>The choice of which of the following agents to select should be based in part upon knowledge of local pathogen susceptibility patterns and whether or not the agent is more likely to increase the spectrum of activity against suspected pathogens. Because patients experience worse outcomes if initial antimicrobial therapy is ineffective against the causative pathogen, the 2016 HAP and VAP guidelines have chosen a goal of trying to assure that &ge;95 percent of patients with VAP receive empiric therapy with activity against the most likely pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>If patients have recently received antibiotics, empiric therapy should generally be with a drug from a different class since earlier treatment may have selected pathogens resistant to the initial class. For patients with highly resistant or pan-resistant gram-negative bacilli, consultation with a specialist with expertise in antimicrobial management of such infections is recommended.</p><p>Risk factors for MDR VAP have been addressed in several studies. In a meta-analysis that included 15 studies, factors associated with an increased risk of MDR VAP were use of intravenous (IV) antibiotics in the past 90 days (odds ratio [OR] 12.3, 95% CI 6.48-23.35), &ge;5 days of hospitalization prior to the occurrence of VAP, septic shock at the time of VAP (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.12-3.61), acute respiratory distress syndrome before VAP (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.88-5.1), and renal replacement therapy prior to VAP (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.14-5.49) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Coma present at the time of ICU admission was associated with lower risk of MDR VAP (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08-0.52). In a meta-analysis of observational studies of patients with VAP and bacteremia, inappropriate therapy significantly increased patients' odds of mortality (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.12-8.19) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Reassessing a patient's status 72 hours after the initiation of therapy and to discontinuing antibiotics or narrowing the regimen (deescalating therapy) based upon appropriate culture results may reduce the selective pressure for antimicrobial resistance. (See <a href=\"#H1976715513\" class=\"local\">'Deescalation'</a> below.)</p><p>Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been shown to reduce rates of nosocomial infections (including <em>C. difficile</em>, methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> [MRSA], and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections) and antimicrobial expenditures without affecting mortality or length of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

If the pathogen has been identified, the choice of antibiotic for oral therapy is based upon the susceptibility profile for that organism.

The rationale for this recommendation was that mortality and clinical cure rates were similar with seven days compared with longer courses, even when considering the subset of patients with pneumonia due to gram-negative bacilli. There was a small increase in the rate of recurrence in such patients, but this was observed in subgroup analyses that had important limitations.</p><p>We agree that most patients with HAP or VAP should receive a seven-day course of antibiotics, but we recommend that all patients with HAP or VAP be evaluated for clinical response and results of microbiologic studies after initial empiric antimicrobial therapy.
