These conditions include inborn errors of metabolism, endocrine disorders, hemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis, and critical congenital heart defects. Early treatment of these rare disorders may significantly reduce mortality and morbidity in affected patients.</p><p>The principles of newborn screening, screening policies, testing, and follow-up are reviewed here. Specific disorders and screening for hearing loss and critical congenital heart defects are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-identifying-the-specific-disorder#H2926302\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Identifying the specific disorder&quot;, section on 'Newborn screening'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening the newborn for hearing loss&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104529174\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal metabolic screening began in the early 1960s with the work of Robert Guthrie, who developed a screening test for phenylketonuria (PKU) and a system for the collection and transportation of small blood samples on filter paper (known as the Guthrie card) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The screening technique he developed (the Guthrie test) was a bacterial inhibition assay. It was based upon the principle that the inhibition of bacterial growth on an agar plate produced by a biochemical compound (on a disc) is prevented by an amino acid or metabolite with a structure similar to the inhibitory substance. When a blood specimen contains greater than normal quantities of an amino acid or metabolite, a large growth of bacteria occurs around the disc. This technique has been used to detect other inborn errors of metabolism, including maple syrup urine disease, homocystinuria, tyrosinemia, and histidinemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Technology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technical advances facilitated the expansion of newborn screening to include detection of additional disorders.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A radioimmunoassay for thyroxine (T4) made possible screening for congenital hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isoelectric focusing and liquid chromatography allowed for mass screening for hemoglobinopathies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) facilitated screening for mutations in the hemoglobin genes in DNA extracted from dried blood samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tandem mass spectrometry (also referred to as MS-MS) and other new techniques have expanded the possibilities for mass screening of multiple disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Tandem mass spectrometry detects molecules by measuring their weight and is a series of two mass spectrometers, which sort samples, and identify and weigh the molecules of interest. It is best used when screening for inborn errors of organic acid, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism.

This timing permits the maximum accumulation of abnormal compounds in the infant's blood and the best chance of obtaining a positive result if disease is present. Blood samples are obtained by puncture of the newborn's warmed heel. The blood is collected on filter paper provided for this purpose, completely filling the designated circles. Samples are sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Appropriate documentation is completed, including the patient's name, birth date and time, date and time of the specimen, and contact information for the clinician who will provide follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H506549361\" class=\"local\">'Clinical laboratory quality assurance'</a> below and <a href=\"#H104530296\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>As noted above, newborn screening for hearing loss and critical congenital heart disorder are performed at birth centers prior to discharge.

Delayed screening for these infants places them at high risk for developing identifiable conditions that may be amenable to treatment. However, this must be balanced with the increased risk of false-positive findings in premature infants, particularly for screening that includes testing of amino acid and acylcarnitine profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In one report, the false-positive rate for amino acids was higher in preterm infants who were receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although the authors suggest that holding PN for three hours before obtaining the blood sample for newborn screening would reduce the rate of false-positive tests, this may not be practical in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104530296\"><span class=\"h3\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rapid follow-up of an infant with a positive or equivocal screening test is of the highest priority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Positive results from newborn screening should have a confirmatory test performed as quickly as possible. The pediatrician or primary care provider (PCP) is responsible for ensuring that newborn screening has been completed and that all positive screening results are followed until a diagnosis is confirmed or excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The primary care provider also must remain vigilant to the development of disease, as a negative result does not rule out a disorder even if screening is performed appropriately (false-negative test). False-negative results are more likely in infants born prematurely, in those who received blood transfusions or dialysis therapy, or in those who were tested too early (less than 24 hours of age). The primary care provider should also provide education and support to families with infants with a false-positive result as parents may continue to have some anxiety, and the impact can be decreased with careful explanation of the process. The risk of a false-positive result is higher in preterm infants with gestational age &lt;32 weeks screened for hypothyroidism and adrenal hyperplasia before 48 hours of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104533454\"><span class=\"h4\">Communication of results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of communicating test results, including the role of state and local public health agencies, varies widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/20,28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,28-32</a>]. In some states, the testing laboratory is assigned the responsibility of communicating test results to the health professional and birth hospital. In other states, the role of locating infants and communicating test results is assigned to local health department staff. Most state programs require that a healthcare professional be notified of results. However, this may be the clinician of record at the infant's birth hospital and not the pediatrician who will provide long-term care. In cases of positive screening results that require urgent follow-up (eg, highly abnormal screening test for a metabolic disorder), newborn screening programs will actively seek parents to inform them in order to expedite diagnosis and treatment. The pediatrician should be aware of the system in his or her state to ensure the appropriate and timely transfer of information and notification of parents. Ideally, parents should be informed when the results of screening are normal, but this is a much less time sensitive issue and therefore less of a challenge.</p><p>In many cases, the primary clinician may not be prepared to provide the initial counseling and subspecialty referral for these infants and their families. This was illustrated in a survey of general pediatricians and family clinicians in the United States that demonstrated many responding clinicians did not feel competent to discuss the results of a positive newborn screen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Continued efforts are required to ensure that primary care clinicians are adequately trained and supported to deliver appropriate follow-up care of these infants and their families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Communication of the identification of the carrier state (eg, sickle cell trait) is challenging because it does not usually have health consequences for the newborn, but is important for future reproductive planning for the newborn's parents or for the child as an adult.

These include having clinicians familiarize themselves with their state screening program, collecting state-specific contact information for regional medical subspecialists, and setting up a process to confirm that all newborns have been screened and that screening results have been received.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collaboration among healthcare professionals &ndash; The report also outlines the roles of other healthcare professionals that are necessary to the successful operation of a newborn screening system and provision of optimal care to infants and their families.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prenatal healthcare clinicians (eg, obstetricians) should educate expectant parents on the importance of newborn screening and identifying the medical home for their newborn infant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Birthing facilities are responsible for obtaining, processing, and delivering a high-quality specimen to the designated screening laboratory. Identification of the medical home should be established as a condition for discharge. Discharge documents should clearly indicate whether or not screening was performed. They should identify the name of the clinician responsible for the birth hospitalization and the name of the PCP providing clinical care after discharge, who are contacts for any abnormal result.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pediatric medical subspecialists provide coordinated care with the primary care clinician when a child is diagnosed with a specific disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Genetic counseling, testing of other family members, and family support services should be facilitated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/23,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,35,36</a>]. Subspecialists should also provide guidance to the states in the development of screening programs, including educational material.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children with PKU, congenital hypothyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and other conditions identified by newborn screening programs may have behavioral changes resulting from these disorders, although intellectual disability (mental retardation), learning difficulties, and some behavior problems are reduced by early intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Thus, long-term follow-up, including neuropsychological testing, should be provided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The role of the state is to design, coordinate, and manage an effective newborn screening system. However, the effectiveness of state newborn screening programs in the follow-up of infants varies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

As the number of tests and their complexity increases, it has become increasingly challenging to meet the CLIA requirements. As a result, guidelines have been published to help laboratories meet the CLIA requirements by a collaboration among the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The five most commonly diagnosed conditions were 1) hearing loss, 2) primary congenital hypothyroidism, 3) cystic fibrosis, 4) sickle cell disease, and 5) medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening the newborn for hearing loss&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Newborn screening'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H59099793\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Newborn screening'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders&quot;, section on 'Newborn screening'</a>.)</p><p>Although early identification generally will allow for earlier intervention, which will reduce morbidity and mortality, it remains challenging to provide adequate follow-up with confirmation of diagnosis and long-term care for affected individuals with a specific chronic condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80035516\"><span class=\"h1\">ONGOING CHALLENGES AND CONTROVERSIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many areas of challenge and debate in newborn screening, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of the residual dried blood spot specimen &ndash; Researchers can use anonymized dried blood spots to develop new screening tests. However, some families are concerned about the risk to privacy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of late-onset disease &ndash; Some newborn screening tests that detect significant illness in childhood will also identify individuals who might not develop illness until adulthood. Assessing the benefit versus harm of early identification of late-onset disease is challenging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of conditions for which treatment has not been established &ndash; Identifying newborns with serious conditions in the presymptomatic period may be important to develop new treatments. Some families might want to know early about serious health conditions in their children, even in the absence of therapy. This can help avoid unnecessary diagnostic evaluation, and allow families to make plans for the affected child and make informed reproductive decisions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of carriers &ndash; Newborn screening can identify carriers for many of the targeted conditions. There is debate about how and when to inform these children about their carrier status to inform future reproductive decisions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cascade testing of family members &ndash; After diagnosis through newborn screening of certain conditions (eg, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy), it is reasonable to test first-degree family members to see whether they are carriers or affected by the condition. A number of ethical and psychosocial issues apply to genetic testing, including the consequences for the family, issues related to testing children who are unaffected, and concerns about genetic discrimination. Clinicians must consider the benefits and risks of genetic testing, including the possibility of false-positive and false-negative results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of long-term care &ndash; Early identification of most of the conditions included in newborn screening allows modification of the condition from being associated with significant morbidity and mortality in infancy to a long-term chronic illness. Developing systems to assure that these individuals have access to chronic disease management, including medications or nonpharmacologic therapy (eg, specific diet), is challenging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resource allocation &ndash; Public health agencies have limited resources, and assuring comprehensive newborn screening is costly. Often the cost of the screening test is coalesced into the cost of operating the newborn screening program and does not include resources to assure appropriate follow-up care. Policy makers therefore need to consider all costs related to the adoption of newborn screening for each condition.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE DIRECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is likely that neonatal screening will expand to include more of the global population. Rapid improvements in scientific knowledge and technique are likely to increase the number of disorders that can be detected, especially genetic conditions and infectious diseases. The ability to obtain and archive dried blood spots from the newborn screening programs also provides the potential for future epidemiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In addition, many newborn screening tests may be replaced by molecular screening in early pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. It will be important for local, national, and international policy makers to keep pace with these changes and to address the ethical, legal, and financial challenges involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of newborn screening is to detect disorders that are threatening to life or long-term health before they become symptomatic. Newborn screening tests are administered to healthy populations to identify infants who may have a serious condition and require further testing for diagnostic confirmation. These conditions include inborn errors of metabolism, endocrine disorders, hemoglobinopathies, severe combined immunodeficiency, congenital hearing loss, and critical congenital heart defects.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An effective newborn screening program selects conditions based on their incidence within the targeted population; the availability of a reliable, timely, cost-effective screening test; and the accessibility of effective treatment, which improves patient outcome. Because of differences in how these decisions are made, there is variation among newborn screening programs worldwide. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Principles of screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, each state has established a newborn screening program. However, in order to minimize variability among states, the United States Department of Health and Human Services has established a <a href=\"http://www.hrsa.gov/advisorycommittees/mchbadvisory/heritabledisorders/recommendedpanel/index.html&amp;token=fNld99uw+KzL1LPxqlqa04cKT2hd6K7s9zoScihRfUKhVH/LFGE0LHjVJ4Oz/vHi8HiFpZbPM49VYQwveQUOFohxbwEeBocyCJHqM3Kpn+BiE6ACxipxsXFF200YCdBp&amp;TOPIC_ID=4980\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP)</a>. A list of disorders screened in each state is available from the <a href=\"http://www.babysfirsttest.org/&amp;token=y9kRLdxq6iVrqdOe+feozXliYGoMxoky8Z3c2aJ19N1tFG5GCMCr6lqpvoZ/wAlS&amp;TOPIC_ID=4980\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Baby's First Test</a> website, a resource for information and education for healthcare providers and families about newborn screening. Similar information is available for other countries. (See <a href=\"#H104529548\" class=\"local\">'Policy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H104529513\" class=\"local\">'Programs throughout the world'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing typically occurs during the birth hospitalization. Blood samples are collected on filter paper from puncture of the newborn's warmed heel, which are sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Testing at individual birth centers includes screening for congenital hearing loss and critical congenital heart defects. (See <a href=\"#H104530600\" class=\"local\">'Birth hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive results from newborn screening should have a confirmatory test performed as quickly as possible. The pediatrician or primary care provider (PCP) is responsible for ensuring that newborn screening has been completed and that all positive screening results are followed until a diagnosis is confirmed or excluded. (See <a href=\"#H104530296\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, laboratories that perform biochemical genetic testing and public health newborn screening are required to meet the general quality systems and personnel requirements for testing of the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations. (See <a href=\"#H506549361\" class=\"local\">'Clinical laboratory quality assurance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, newborn screening detects one of 29 core conditions in 12,500 of the four million infants born each year, which results in a detection rate of 1:4000 live births. (See <a href=\"#H104534036\" class=\"local\">'Screening outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although newborn screening is incorporated into the healthcare system in all developed countries, there remain ongoing challenges and controversies such as resource allocation, identification of conditions that are late-onset or have no established treatment, and identification of carriers. (See <a href=\"#H80035516\" class=\"local\">'Ongoing challenges and controversies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70497180\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Lori Sielski, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">GUTHRIE R, SUSI A.
