Some clinicians also use physiological tests, known as weaning predictors, to predict whether a patient is ready because they are hesitant to begin weaning on the basis of clinical criteria alone. The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is one of the best studied and most commonly used weaning predictors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weaning &ndash; Weaning is the process of decreasing ventilator support and allowing patients to assume a greater proportion of their ventilation. It may involve either an immediate shift from full ventilatory support to a period of breathing without assistance from the ventilator (ie, a spontaneous breathing trial [SBT]) or a gradual reduction in the amount of ventilator support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Regardless of which approach is chosen, extubation is considered once the patient demonstrates the ability to breathe without the ventilator.</p><p/><p>The definition, accuracy, effect on clinical outcomes, and measurement of the RSBI are reviewed here. The role of the RSBI in readiness testing is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;, section on 'Approach to readiness testing'</a>.)</p><p>General aspects of readiness testing, methods of weaning, and extubation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extubation-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extubation management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume <span class=\"nowrap\">(f/VT)</span>. As an example, a patient who has a respiratory rate of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min</span> and a tidal volume of 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/breath</span> has an RSBI of (25 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min)/(</span>.25 L) = 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L</span>.</p><p>Patients who cannot tolerate independent breathing tend to breathe rapidly (high frequency) and shallowly (low tidal volume). Thus, they generally have a high RSBI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ACCURACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) was originally described in a prospective cohort study that evaluated a population of mechanically ventilated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The study found that an RSBI &gt;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L</span> was associated with weaning failure, while an RSBI &lt;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L</span> predicted weaning success with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 97, 64, 78, and 95 percent, respectively. The pretest probability of weaning success in the study population was approximately 60 percent.</p><p>The sensitivity is the probability that a patient who successfully weans will have an RSBI &lt;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L</span> and the specificity is the probability that a patient who fails weaning will have an RSBI &ge;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L</span>. The positive predictive value is the probability of successfully weaning when the RSBI is &lt;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L</span> and the negative predictive value is the probability of failing weaning when the RSBI is &gt;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L</span>.</p><p>Positive and negative predictive values are not optimal measures for assessing the quality of a weaning predictor, since they vary according to the pretest probability (ie, prevalence) of weaning success in the population studied. Likelihood ratios are better measures because they are independent of the pretest probability. The likelihood ratio positive (LR+) and likelihood ratio negative (LR-) are calculated as shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72793\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72793 \">table 1</a>). The greater the deviation of the LR+ from 1, the more powerful a positive test is as a predictor of a positive outcome. The greater the deviation of the LR- from 1, the more powerful a negative test is as a predictor of a negative outcome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-diagnostic-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating diagnostic tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When data from the original prospective cohort study were used to calculate likelihood ratios, the LR+ was 2.7 and the LR- was 0.05. This indicated that there was only a small increase in the probability of weaning success among patients with a positive RSBI (&lt;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L)</span>. In contrast, there was a large increase in the probability of weaning failure among patients with a negative RSBI (&ge;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L)</span>.</p><p>These findings were supported by a systematic review of 20 RSBI studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Pooled results of predictors of success in trials of unassisted breathing found an LR+ of 1.66 to 2.1 and an LR- of 0.11, indicating that there is only a small increase in the probability of weaning success among patients with a positive RSBI, but a moderate increase in the probability of weaning failure among patients with a negative RSBI. A Bayesian analysis of the same studies found similar LR+ and LR- values, supporting the conclusions from the systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Taken together, the evidence suggests that a negative RSBI is better at identifying patients who will fail weaning than a positive RSBI is at identifying patients who can be successfully weaned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) on clinical outcomes was demonstrated by a trial that enrolled 304 mechanically ventilated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition to having their RSBI measured daily, all of the patients underwent daily screening. This consisted of assessment of their ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>),</span> positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), hemodynamic stability, mental status, and cough. Patients randomized to RSBI-dependent weaning underwent an SBT if they passed all components of the screening and had an RSBI &lt;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L</span>. In contrast, patients randomized to RSBI-independent weaning underwent an SBT if they passed all components of the screening, regardless of their RSBI.</p><p>The group that underwent RSBI-dependent weaning took one day longer to discontinue mechanical ventilation. There was no difference in the total duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, or reintubation rate.</p><p>A limitation of the trial was that it used a single RSBI threshold; many clinicians with expertise in discontinuing mechanical ventilation believe the optimal threshold varies from patient to patient. The trial was otherwise rigorously conducted. There did not appear to be any selection bias, since the trial's RSBI-independent weaning group had a nearly identical rate of weaning success (59 percent) compared to that seen in the original prospective cohort study described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASUREMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the prospective cohort study that originally described the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), the respiratory frequency (f) and tidal volume (VT) were measured using a hand-held spirometer attached to the endotracheal tube while a patient breathed room air for one minute without any ventilator assistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>There are many variables that may influence measurement of the RSBI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilator support &ndash; If the RSBI is measured on ventilatory support, the values will be lower than if measured during independent breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This was demonstrated by a study of 36 patients that measured the RSBI during pressure support ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and independent breathing through a T-piece in each patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The RSBI was &lt;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L</span> during pressure support ventilation (PSV) and CPAP in all patients, but increased to &gt;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L</span> during independent breathing through the T-piece in 13 of the 36 patients (36 percent). Another study of 80 patients found a significant 17 percent decrease in RSBI (determined on CPAP and PSV set at 0 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), when comparing measurements made with and without flow triggering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. To reduce this confounding influence, we set the ventilator to a pressure support level of 0 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, without flow trigger, if we plan to measure the RSBI while the patient is connected to the ventilator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Method of measuring the respiratory frequency &ndash; If the RSBI is determined while the patient is breathing through the ventilator, one must be cautious about using the respiratory rate measured by the ventilator because it may be underestimated if the patient makes inspiratory efforts that are not sensed by the ventilator (untriggered breaths). Such unmeasured inspiratory efforts falsely lower the RSBI. This is most likely to occur in patients who have chronic obstructive lung disease with dynamic hyperinflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other &ndash; A number of other factors have been shown to increase the RSBI, including a narrow endotracheal tube, female gender, sepsis, fever, supine position, anxiety, suctioning, and chronic restrictive lung disease. In one study, women and those with a narrow endotracheal tube were more likely than others to have an RSBI &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L,</span> independent of the weaning outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In another study, endotracheal suctioning increased the RSBI for up to five minutes, often rising to &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-the-rapid-shallow-breathing-index/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discontinuing mechanical ventilation is a two step process that consists of readiness testing and weaning.
