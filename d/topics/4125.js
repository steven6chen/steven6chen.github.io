BMS prevented restenosis by attenuating early arterial recoil and contraction. However, the rate of clinically indicated target lesion repeat revascularization due to restenosis at one year remained relatively high at 10 to 20 percent of patients and is often due to excessive growth of neointima [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracoronary-stent-restenosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracoronary stent restenosis&quot;, section on 'Incidence of restenosis'</a>.)</p><p>Drug-eluting stents (DES) were developed to reduce the high rate of restenosis and subsequent need for repeat revascularization with BMS. Clinical trials have confirmed a reduction of as much as 50 to 70 percent in target lesion revascularization by DES compared with BMS. These findings have led to the preferential use of DES in most stent cases. </p><p>This topic will attempt to clarify the role of BMS in contemporary coronary artery disease interventional practice. The discussions of the various types of DES and coronary artery stent types in development are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comparison of drug-eluting intracoronary stents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bioresorbable-polymer-or-scaffold-drug-eluting-coronary-artery-stents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bioresorbable polymer or scaffold drug-eluting coronary artery stents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193802422\"><span class=\"h1\">STENT CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All coronary artery stents consist of a metallic backbone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65603 \">table 1</a>). Drug-eluting stents (DES) have an antiproliferative drug, and a polymer that serves as the vehicle for the drug and also controls the drug release rate. The drug inhibits excessive growth of neointima, a major cause of restenosis. Since each DES is unique, differences may be observed with respect to deliverability (ease of placement), efficacy (prevention of restenosis), and safety (rates of stent thrombosis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comparison of drug-eluting intracoronary stents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348517385\"><span class=\"h1\">BMS COMPARED WITH DES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer drug-eluting stents (DES) to bare metal stents (BMS) in most clinical situations. Current-generation DES have lower rates of clinically indicated repeat revascularization compared with BMS and are not limited by late safety concerns as were the first-generation DES. </p><p>Restenosis and the need for target lesion revascularization usually occur within the first year after stent placement; it is within the first year that DES are superior to BMS. Late restenosis (after one year) has been documented with all types of intracoronary stents. The rate is approximately 1 to 2 percent per year and is similar between first- or second-generation DES and BMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. In addition, for patients who are able to comply with recommendations for long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), there is no significant difference in the rate of late (30 days to one year) and very late stent (after one year) thrombosis. Other parameters of safety, such as cardiac mortality, are the same or better with newer-generation DES.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850293678\"><span class=\"h2\">Older DES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most studies that have evaluated the efficacy or safety of BMS compared with DES, patients received older sirolimus- or paclitaxel-eluting stents (SES or PES); these have been called first-generation DES. There are few studies that directly compare second-generation everolimus-eluting or zotarolimus-eluting stents (EES or ZES) with BMS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65603 \">table 1</a>). In most studies, SES and PES outperform BMS with regard to the need for repeat revascularization and there is no difference in long-term mortality.</p><p>High-quality evidence of efficacy benefit (a lower rate of target vessel revascularization) from first-generation DES comes from multiple randomized trials and large percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) registry data bases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/8-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-17</a>]. In nearly all settings, DES lower the rate of target lesion revascularization by 50 to 70 percent compared with BMS.</p><p>The first studies evaluated patients who had less complex and &quot;on-label&quot; lesions. A 2007 meta-analysis included 38 randomized trials involving over 18,000 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. On-label indications typically included de novo (not restenotic or bypass graft) lesions with a diameter of 2.5 to 3.75 mm and a lesion length of less than 28 mm and excluded complex anatomy such as left main disease, occluded vessels, or bifurcation lesions. The three largest studies in the meta-analysis were SIRIUS, TAXUS IV, and TAXUS V, and the duration of follow-up was one to four years. The first-generation SES or PES were used in these trials. The principal finding was that there was a significant reduction in target lesion revascularization with both SES and PES compared with BMS (an absolute difference of approximately 12 percent at four years). Multiple analyses of randomized trials demonstrated no difference between DES and BMS for safety end points (total mortality, cardiac mortality, or myocardial infarction [MI]) at up to four years when used for on-label indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>].</p><p>Similar findings were noted in another meta-analysis and in several large registries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. The Ontario, Canada coronary intervention database evaluated 3751 propensity-matched pairs of patients who received either DES or BMS from 2003 to 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The following findings were noted in this registry of patients who likely had more complex lesions than those enrolled in clinical trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At two years, the rate of target vessel revascularization was lower in patients who received DES (7.4 versus 10.7 percent; p &lt;0.001). The benefit was limited to those patients with two or three risk factors for restenosis (diabetes, vessels &lt;3 mm in diameter, and lesions &ge;20 mm in length).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other studies have confirmed benefit of DES compared with BMS in patients with larger vessels or shorter lesions, although the absolute difference in benefit is smaller. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-intracoronary-stents-for-specific-coronary-lesions#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of intracoronary stents for specific coronary lesions&quot;, section on 'Large coronary arteries'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-intracoronary-stents-for-specific-coronary-lesions#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of intracoronary stents for specific coronary lesions&quot;, section on 'Long lesions or diffuse disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The lower absolute difference in benefit may enter into decision-making when choosing between BMS and DES. (See <a href=\"#H348519460\" class=\"local\">'When to choose a BMS'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three-year mortality was significantly lower in the DES group (5.5 versus 7.8 percent), while the rates of MI were not significantly different.</p><p/><p>As experience with first-generation DES increased, these stents were used for (off-label) indications that were not initially approved by regulatory agencies, such as multilesion PCI, small vessels, large vessels, lesions longer than 30 mm, ostial lesions, restenotic lesions, lesions of the left main, total occlusions, bifurcation lesions, and saphenous vein graft stenosis, and in those with acute MI. Large observational studies demonstrated a lower rate of target vessel revascularization with first-generation DES compared with BMS when placed in off-label situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Five large observational studies of unrestricted (off- and on-label) stent use comparing BMS and DES (PES or SES) have addressed this issue: Three found lower rates of death or MI with DES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>] and two found equivalent rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/28,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,32</a>]. Each of these observational reports is subject to unmeasured confounding, as there are several reasons for selection of BMS that may be associated with increased risk for mortality, including underlying malignancy, general frailty, etc. We believe that the best interpretation of these studies is that there is no clinically significant difference in the rates of death or MI between DES and BMS when selected for use in patients who are eligible for and likely to comply with appropriate duration of DAPT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H667594739\"><span class=\"h2\">Contemporary DES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EES and ZES stents are referred to as second (current)-generation DES. The evidence presented below demonstrates comparable (to BMS) outcomes for death from any cause, stent thrombosis, and nonfatal MI. However, the risk of repeat revascularization is significantly lower with contemporary DES.</p><p>The best available evidence comes from the NORSTENT trial, which randomly assigned 9012 patients with stable or unstable coronary artery disease (2008 to 2011) to PCI with contemporary DES (EES or ZES) or contemporary, thin-strut BMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. All patients were treated with DAPT for six months. At six years, there was no difference in the rates of the primary outcome (a composite of death from any cause and nonfatal MI) between the two groups (16.6 versus 17.1 percent, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 0.98, 95% CI 0.88-1.09). The rate of repeat revascularization was lower with DES (15.5 and 19.8 percent, respectively; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69-0.85). The rates of definite stent thrombosis were low at 0.8 and 1.2 percent, respectively (p = 0.0498).</p><p>Meta-analyses performed before NORSTENT raised the possibility of a lower rate of cardiac death or stent thrombosis with contemporary DES:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2014 patient-level meta-analysis of five trials that compared cobalt-chromium EES with BMS found that participants receiving cobalt-chromium EES had a significant reduction of cardiac mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.91), MI (0.71, 0.55-0.92), definite or probable stent thrombosis (0.48, 0.31-0.73), and target vessel revascularization (0.29, 0.20-0.41) at a median follow-up of 720 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2015 network meta-analysis evaluated 51 trials that compared DES with each other or with BMS (n = 52,158) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Comparing second-generation DES with BMS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65603 \">table 1</a>), the risk of target vessel revascularization was significantly lower for all second-generation DES, ranging from a one-third to a one-half risk reduction at a median follow-up of 3.8 years. The risk of definite or probable stent thrombosis was lower with CoCr-EES (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.73), PC-ZES (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44-1.10), and PtCr-EES (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11-2.70). The risk of cardiac death was lower with CoCr-EES (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.91), PC-ZES (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-1.00), PtCr-EES (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.19-1.10), and Re-ZES (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51-1.50).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348519460\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO CHOOSE A BMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the evidence provided above, we use second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) rather than bare metal stents (BMS) in most cases based on a significantly lower need for target vessel revascularization and a similar or better safety profile as long as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) can be maintained for the recommended period of time. Our recommendations for the duration of DAPT are found elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients#H1840123222\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>):</p><p>In patients who need to stop DAPT before the recommended duration of therapy, the likelihood of stent thrombosis significantly increases (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Incidence and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Early and late stent thrombosis'</a>). However, there is uncertainty regarding the relative rates of stent thrombosis with BMS and DES in patients who stop DAPT prematurely for any reason. Some experts have suggested the earlier endothelialization seen with BMS compared with DES might lead to a relatively decreased risk of stent thrombosis in patients treated with BMS who prematurely discontinue DAPT. There is no high-quality evidence which demonstrates that the use of BMS is superior to second-generation DES in this setting.</p><p>The ZEUS and LEADERS FREE trials were published after the 2015 meta-analysis discussed above (see <a href=\"#H348517385\" class=\"local\">'BMS compared with DES'</a> above). Both support an argument that even in patients who cannot receive the recommended duration of DAPT, current-generation DES outperform BMS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the ZEUS trial, 1606 patients (with stable or unstable symptoms) for whom it was not clear whether DES or BMS was a superior choice (eg, high bleeding risk, low restenosis risk, or high stent thrombosis risk) were randomly assigned to E-ZES or BMS and treated with DAPT for at least 30 days after which they received either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or P2Y<sub>12 </sub>monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The total duration of DAPT was prespecified based on the reason for inclusion and the mean duration was 32 days. The primary end point of 12-month major adverse cardiovascular events (including death, myocardial infarction [MI], or target vessel revascularization) occurred less often with E-ZES (17.5 versus 22.1 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.95). This was driven by lower rates of MI and target vessel revascularization. The rate of definite or probable stent thrombosis was significantly reduced in E-ZES patients (2 versus 4.1 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A prespecified analysis evaluated outcomes in 828 patients at high bleeding risk who had at least one of the following: age older than 80 years; clinical indication for treatment with oral anticoagulant agents; recent bleeding episodes that required medical attention or hospitalization; systemic conditions associated with increased bleeding risk; known anemia; and the need for long-term treatment with steroids or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The primary end point occurred less often with E-ZES (22.6 versus 29 percent; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.98).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the LEADERS FREE trial, 2466 patients who were candidates for a BMS rather than a DES were randomly assigned to a polymer- and carrier-free drug-coated stent that transfers umirolimus (biolimus A9) into the vessel wall over one month or a similar bare metal stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bioresorbable-polymer-or-scaffold-drug-eluting-coronary-artery-stents#H103379884\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bioresorbable polymer or scaffold drug-eluting coronary artery stents&quot;, section on 'Polymer-free DES'</a>). All patients received DAPT for one month followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> alone. The primary safety end point, a composite of cardiac death, MI, or stent thrombosis, occurred less often in the drug-coated group at 390 days (9.4 versus 12.9 percent; p = 0.005 for superiority), owing to a difference in spontaneous and Type 4C (restenosis-related) MI during follow-up. The primary efficacy end point of target lesion revascularization occurred less often in the drug-coated stent group (5.1 versus 9.8 percent; p &lt;0.001).</p><p/><p>The ZEUS and LEADERS FREE trials suggest that even in patients who receive DAPT for as short as 30 days, outcomes are better with second-generation DES compared with BMS. Thus, we believe it may be reasonable to consider a second-generation DES or a BMS for patients who can receive 30 days of uninterrupted DAPT, but not the recommended longer duration of DAPT. However, the DES used in the LEADERS FREE trial is not available for clinical use in the United States and the E-ZES used in ZEUS is no longer available. Thus, we believe the evidence to support a second-generation DES, rather than a BMS, in patients who are likely to receive short-duration DAPT is weak and requires support of additional studies.</p><p>Circumstances in which implantation of a BMS may be reasonable:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in whom a DES cannot be implanted due to large vessel size (&gt;5 mm).
