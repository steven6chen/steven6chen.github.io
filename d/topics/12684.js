Furthermore, the decrease in both estrogen and progestin content in the last decade has led to a reduction in both side effects and cardiovascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, these preparations are a safe contraceptive option for many women. While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had previously set upper age limits for OC use as 35 years for smokers and 40 years for nonsmokers, all references to age limits were removed in 1989 for healthy, nonsmoking women. Thus, OCs can be given until menopause in such women.</p><p>This topic will review the general principles of the use of combined estrogen-progestin OCs, including pharmacology, mechanisms of action, indications, contraindications, efficacy, and the different preparations that are available. Progestin-only OCs, the side effects that may be associated with OCs, other forms of estrogen-progestin contraception, and the topic of contraception in general are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progestin-only-pills-pops-for-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progestin-only pills (POPs) for contraception&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transdermal-contraceptive-patch\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transdermal contraceptive patch&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discovery in 1938 that addition of an ethinyl group to estradiol resulted in both an orally active estrogen compound and a dramatic increase in estrogenic potency was a major advance in steroid biochemistry. This compound, known as ethinyl estradiol, is the estrogen in nearly all oral contraceptives (OCs) currently used.</p><p>Soon thereafter, ethinyl substitution of testosterone also was found to result in an orally active compound (ethisterone). Removal of the carbon at the C-19 position of ethisterone changed it from an androgen to a progestin. This finding resulted in the development of a class of progestins referred to as 19-nortestosterone derivatives. Included in this class are commonly used progestins such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a>, norethindrone acetate, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a>. Ethynodiol diacetate, another progestin in this category, also has significant estrogenic activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87416 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>All of these testosterone-derived progestins bind to the androgen receptor and have some residual androgenic activity. The adverse metabolic effects of OCs, such as the reduction in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations, are the result of the androgenic activity of the progestin. New progestins have been developed with less androgenic activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87416 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Progestin component'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF ACTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452799996\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral contraceptives (OCs) have several mechanisms of action, including suppression of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and pituitary gonadotropin secretion. The most important mechanism for providing contraception is inhibition of the midcycle luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, so that ovulation does not occur (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-the-normal-menstrual-cycle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of the normal menstrual cycle&quot;</a>). Combination OCs are potent in this regard, but progestin-only pills are not.</p><p>Another mechanism of contraceptive action is suppression of ovarian folliculogenesis (via suppression of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] secretion). However, a substantial number of women develop follicles while taking an OC that contains lower doses of ethinyl estradiol (20 to 35 mcg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Clinicians often recommend that back-up contraception be used in the first cycle of OC use, due to concern that early follicular development could result in breakthrough ovulation (most package inserts recommend starting the pill on the first Sunday after menses, which could be as late as day 7). In a study of 140 women randomly assigned to start their OC (containing 30 mcg ethinyl <span class=\"nowrap\">estradiol/day)</span> on day 1, 4, or 7 of menses, follicular development (diameter &gt;13 mm) was more common with the later start days (10.3, 17.2, and 44.4 percent for days 1, 4, and 7, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, rates of ovulation were no different in the three groups (7, 3, and 0 percent, respectively). Thus, back-up contraception might not be necessary in the first month of OC use, but a larger study is needed before changing clinical practice.</p><p>Progestin-related mechanisms also contribute to the contraceptive effect (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progestin-only-pills-pops-for-contraception#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progestin-only pills (POPs) for contraception&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of action'</a>). These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effects on the endometrium, rendering it less suitable for implantation. The daily progestin exposure leads to endometrial decidualization and eventual atrophy (eg, with continuous or extended-cycle OC regimens).

While preparations containing less androgenic progestins are thought to be the best option in this population, clinical trial data have not demonstrated that they are more effective than OCs containing a more androgenic progestin such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78782 \">table 2</a>).

These include the treatment of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, other menstrual cycle disorders such as hypothalamic amenorrhea, and as hormone replacement in women with primary hypogonadism. OCs have also been used for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257862553\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When taken properly, oral contraceptives (OCs) are a very effective form of contraception. Although the perfect-use failure rate is 0.1 percent, the typical-use failure rate is 8 percent, due primarily to missed pills or failure to resume therapy after the seven-day pill-free interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 3</a>). OCs are available in many formulations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69223 \">table 4</a>), and there is no evidence that generic OCs are less effective than brand name OCs or that different OCs have different perfect-use failure rates, although few comparative studies have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257862559\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of missed pills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Missed pills (particularly if the seven-day hormone-free interval is extended on either end) are a common cause of contraceptive failure.</p><p>If a single pill is missed anywhere in the packet, the forgotten pill needs to be taken when noticed and the next pill is taken when it is due, which may mean taking two pills on the same day. No additional contraception is required.</p><p>Back-up contraception is generally needed if two or more consecutive hormonal pills are missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women should take one of the missed active (hormonal) pills as soon as possible and then continue taking one pill each day as prescribed. Depending on when she remembers her missed pill, she may take two pills on the same day. If pills were missed in the last week of hormone pills, days 15 to 21 of a 28-day pack, omit the hormone-free week by finishing the hormone pills in current pack and start a new pack the next day. If unable to start a new pack, use back-up until hormonal pills from a new pack are taken for seven consecutive days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the two or more pills are missed in the first week of the cycle and unprotected intercourse occurs during this week, use of emergency contraception could decrease the risk of pregnancy.</p><p/><p>This approach is similar to that suggested by the 2013 US Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89825\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89825 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257862595\"><span class=\"h2\">Extra pills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient takes two pills in one day by mistake, she should resume her normal schedule of taking one pill daily the next day; she should not skip a day.

Clinical trial data are somewhat limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In a low-dose (25 mcg) OC trial that enrolled 876 overweight (body mass index [BMI] &ge;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and 1934 normal women (BMI &lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> those in the overweight group had a higher risk of becoming pregnant (relative risk [RR] 1.39) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. One possible explanation for the higher failure rate among overweight women would be incomplete suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, resulting in follicular development and ovulation. However, in a separate trial of 96 normal and 54 obese women (BMI &lt;25 or &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> respectively), rates of follicular development and ovulation (as assessed by pelvic ultrasound) were similar in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Inconsistent or nonuse of the pill, but not obesity, was associated with ovulation. Thus, for overweight or obese women who take OCs, adherence may be particularly important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraception-counseling-for-obese-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraception counseling for obese women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257862607\"><span class=\"h2\">Return of menses after stopping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many women, menses returns within 30 days after stopping the pill. But menses and fertility should return to normal in almost all women by 90 days. This is true for standard 28-day regimens, as well as the extended and continuous regimens. Therefore, women who do not menstruate three months after stopping the pill should undergo the same evaluation for amenorrhea as any woman with amenorrhea.

While breast exams, pap smears, and screening for sexually transmitted diseases are important, most groups, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG), agree that these procedures are not necessary before a first prescription for oral contraceptives (OCs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Documentation of body mass index (BMI) prior to starting OCs is suggested because obese women are at greater risk for venous thromboembolism with OC use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452799559\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OCs can be started anytime during the cycle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56863\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56863 \">algorithm 1</a>). We prefer the <strong>quick start</strong> method in which the woman begins taking OCs on the day that she is given the prescription, as long as pregnancy is reasonably excluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67567\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67567 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. An alternative is the <strong>Sunday start</strong> approach where the woman starts the pill on the first Sunday after her period begins (because most pill packs are arranged for a Sunday start to avoid withdrawal bleeding on a weekend). Some form of back-up contraception is needed for the first seven days of use if one chooses the quick or Sunday start methods because the full contraceptive effect might not be provided immediately.</p><p>The US Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use suggests that if the pill is started &gt;5 days after the onset of menses, back-up contraception should be used for the first seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The <strong>first day start</strong> requires that the woman begin the pill on the first day of menses, which provides the maximum contraceptive effect in the first cycle; back-up contraception for the first seven days of use is not needed. The disadvantages of the Sunday and first day start approaches are that some women do not get around to filling their prescriptions or become confused about instructions or become pregnant before it is time to start the OC.</p><p>OCs are given on a monthly or an extended cycle. An extended-cycle regimen reduces the number of episodes of withdrawal bleeding per year and can completely eliminate these episodes. The hormone-free interval may be zero, two, four, or seven days. Shortening the hormone-free interval may reduce symptoms associated with hormone withdrawal (eg, headache, pelvic pain).

Triphasic preparations contain varying doses of progestin or estrogen plus progestin across the 21 days. One multiphasic preparation is an &quot;estrophasic&quot; OC (Estrostep) that contains a fixed dose of norethindrone acetate (1 mg) and a gradually increasing dose of ethinyl estradiol (20 mcg on cycle days 1 to 5, 30 mcg on days 6 to 12, and 35 mcg on days 13 to 21) in an effort to minimize estrogen-related side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

The first- and second-generation progestins, which are still commonly used, include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a>, norethindrone acetate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a>, and ethynodiol diacetate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87416 \">table 1</a>). Some of these progestins, most notably levonorgestrel, have androgen properties that cause adverse metabolic effects such as lowering serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above.)</p><p>A group of progestins referred to as &quot;third-generation&quot; progestins (norgestimate, desogestrel, and gestodene) were eventually developed that, in spite of being 19-nortestosterone derivatives, have structural modifications that lower their androgenic activity. They include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78782 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87416 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Norgestimate (eg, Ortho-Cyclen or Tri-Cyclen) and desogestrel (eg, Desogen or Ortho-Cept) appear to be the least androgenic compounds in this class; these drugs are available in the United States, while gestodene is not (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87416 \">table 1</a>). Although the new progestins bind to the androgen receptor, the affinity is low, and they have little effect on serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations (which are lowered by androgens and raised by estrogens) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. It is important to note that in many studies of the new progestins, the comparison progestin was <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], which is the most androgenic of the older progestins.</p><p>The contraceptive efficacy of OCs containing the new progestins (so-called third-generation OCs) is similar to that of the older formulations. In addition, when compared with levonorgestrel-containing pills, the newer OCs have less of an effect on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. They are, therefore, a good option for women who have metabolic complications with an older OC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87416 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Despite these potential advantages, there have been concerns about the safety of the newer progestins. Several large epidemiologic studies reported an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis with the use of these progestins, compared with earlier progestins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. A similar increase in risk has been reported with OCs containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproterone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproterone acetate</a>, drospirenone, and the contraceptive patch compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

Furthermore, the decrease in both estrogen and progestin content in the last decade has led to a reduction in both side effects and cardiovascular complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While OCs have several mechanisms of action, the most important mechanism for providing contraception is inhibition of the midcycle luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, so that ovulation does not occur. Another potential mechanism of contraceptive action is suppression of gonadotropin secretion during the follicular phase of the cycle, thereby preventing follicular maturation. However, a substantial number of women develop follicles while taking an OC that contains 20 to 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. Progestin-related mechanisms include effects on the endometrium, rendering it less suitable for implantation, and alterations in cervical mucus, which becomes less permeable to penetration by sperm. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OCs can be started at any time during the cycle. The preferred approach is the quick start method in which the woman begins taking OCs on the day that she is given the prescription, as long as pregnancy is reasonably excluded. An alternative is the Sunday start approach where the woman starts the pill on the first Sunday after her period begins. (See <a href=\"#H452799559\" class=\"local\">'Initiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a number of medical conditions that represent an unacceptable health risk for combined estrogen-progestin OC use. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published medical eligibility criteria (tables) for contraceptive use; the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) modified the tables in 2010. (See <a href=\"#H175457713\" class=\"local\">'World Health Organization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H175457720\" class=\"local\">'Centers for Disease Control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Missed pills (particularly if the missed pills are at the beginning of the pill pack) are a common cause of contraceptive failure. We suggest that back-up contraception be used for seven days after two missed pills, regardless of dose (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H257862559\" class=\"local\">'Effect of missed pills'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The metabolism of OCs is accelerated by any drug that increases liver microsomal enzyme activity such as many of the anticonvulsant drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>. As a result, the contraceptive efficacy of an OC is likely to be decreased in women taking these drugs. In contrast, the metabolism of OCs is <strong>not </strong>affected by antibiotics, with the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several types of combination pills. Monophasic pills contain the same dose of estrogen and progestin in each of the hormonally-active pills. Biphasic or triphasic pills have varying doses of hormone across the cycle (usually the progestin). There are no proven advantages to the multiphasic regimens. We suggest starting with a monophasic pill (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Available preparations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estrogen component of nearly all OCs is ethinyl estradiol. Standard OCs today contain 30 to 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol, but many pills now contain only 20 mcg. Contraceptive efficacy with the 20 mcg pills is similar to the standard-dose pills, as long as adherence is good. These lower-dose pills are a good option for perimenopausal women who have menopausal symptoms (hot flashes) because they also provide contraception and bleeding control. One OC containing only 10 mcg ethinyl estradiol is now available. (See <a href=\"#H150022959\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen component'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of menopausal symptoms with hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Use of oral contraceptives during the menopausal transition'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most available progestins have both progestogenic and androgenic activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78782 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87416 \">table 1</a>). A progestin with pure progestational activity would be ideal because the androgenic activity is not needed for contraception and it increases side effects and metabolic complications. However, more selective progestins have been developed; some function as androgen receptor antagonists. To date, they have no proven clinical advantages over traditional progestins, and some have been associated with a possible higher risk of venous thromboembolism.
