(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected spider bite: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are approximately 30 species of widow spiders found worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Not all have been implicated in human bites, although this may be partly due to the remote distribution of the spiders away from human populations. Female widow spiders are responsible for most significant bites. Males have less venom, smaller fangs, and weaker biting muscles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22850083\"><span class=\"h3\">Identification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most adult widow spiders are shiny black with red markings on the body, although this is not universal. American widow spiders range from 5 to 15 mm (0.25 to 0.5 inch) in total body length with an abdominal diameter of about 10 mm (0.5 inch). The most common species of medical importance are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American species has a red hourglass or anvil-shaped mark on the ventral portion of the abdomen, which can range from a perfect hourglass to two separated triangles, to one triangle and a barely perceptible lower red mark (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78920\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78920 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57539\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57539 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The southern black widow has a red dot just dorsal to the anal region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82471\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82471 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Mediterranean species has a smattering of 13 red dots on the dorsum of the abdomen but lacks ventral red markings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Australian redback is notable for a conspicuous dorsal red stripe running from the anal region forward to about halfway the distance of the abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54343\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54343 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62993\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62993 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p/><p>Other widow species may not be black. The brown widow has an orange hourglass and a series of white stripes on a tan abdomen, giving it a mottled appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other species in the eastern hemisphere are nearly white.</p><p>In addition to color variations among species, immature widow spiders often look very different from the adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F65792\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65792 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115812\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115812 \">picture 7</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22850090\"><span class=\"h3\">Geographic distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Widow spiders are found in warm climates worldwide but can exist in colder climates with routine winter snows, such as Colorado and in Canada (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59049 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, two species are most commonly implicated in envenomations: the southern black widow spider, <em>L. mactans</em>, and the western black widow spider, <em>L. hesperus</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61008\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61008 \">picture 8</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The western black widow spider is very abundant throughout the southwestern United States where it is not uncommon to collect 60 or more an hour in supportive habitats. This species seems more tolerant of cold temperatures than eastern relatives as it is a common species in urban Colorado and in the dry interior region of Washington State.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three other widow species in the United States, which are of less concern: <em>L. variolus</em> in the northern Midwest, the red-legged widow <em>L. bishopi</em>, in palmetto habitats of Florida, and brown widows.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The brown widow, <em>L. geometricus</em>, is found in Florida and more recently, in the deep South from Texas to South Carolina and in coastal southern California [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Brown widow spiders are also found in many other parts of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Their bite is usually mild with pain upon fang penetration and slight erythema at the bite site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Rarely, severe pain, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, and fasciculations can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The redback spider, <em>L. hasselti</em>, is found throughout Australia, except in the hottest deserts and coldest mountains and is the only widow species on that continent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54343\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54343 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62993\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62993 \">picture 5</a>).

In New Zealand, <em>L. katipo</em> is typically only found very close (&lt;1 km) to the coast in native habitat and is also being supplanted by a South African spider and colonies of the Australian redback spider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In South America, <em>L. curacaviensis </em>is widespread and <em>L. geometricus</em> has also caused significant bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Mediterranean region, <em>L. tredecimguttatus</em> is the most common biting widow spider. Because the Mediterranean species is found in many countries, it is known by a colorful array of common names, some of which translate into &quot;black hag&quot; (region formerly known as Yugoslavia) and &quot;black wolf&quot; (Russia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22850097\"><span class=\"h3\">Habitat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Widow spiders typically live outdoors in the clutter surrounding homes and garages, in woodpiles, in rarely used garden equipment, in pots, and in tools. It is rare to find a widow spider indoors unless there is significant insect traffic inside a structure. Bites typically occur as people place their hands into gardening gloves or feet into boots, or compress spiders under potted plants, patio furniture, or toys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, glutamate, and enkephalin systems are all susceptible to the toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/8,15,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15,17-20</a>]. It appears this toxin is present in the venom of all medically important widow spiders and this has clear implications for cross reactivity of anti-<em>Latrodectus</em> antivenoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22850111\"><span class=\"h2\">False black widow spiders (Genus Steatoda)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>False black widow spiders are found around the world and have a bite that causes mild symptoms of latrodectism, sometimes called steatodism. Although their venom also contains a form of alpha-latrotoxin, it is molecularly distinct from that of black widow spiders and causes less serious effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22850118\"><span class=\"h3\">Identification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Steatoda</em> spiders are in the same family (Theridiidae) as the black widows and hence, share a similar body form and size (total length 5 to 15 mm [0.25 to 0.5 inch] and abdominal diameter of about 10 mm [0.5 inch]) which may cause confusion in identification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51082\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51082 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F73853\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73853 \">picture 10</a>). They are typically chocolate brown to black in color and may have some tan stripes or markings on the abdomen. Unlike black widows, they do not have red markings on their bodies.</p><p>There are many species in the genus <em>Steatoda</em>. Most are too small to inflict a medically-important bite due to small fang size, low-venom gland content, or inability of musculature to cause fang penetration in human skin, or a combination of these traits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22850125\"><span class=\"h3\">Geographic distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>False black widows are found in Europe, the United States, and Australia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59049 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In North America, the false black widows are found commonly along the Pacific Coast from southern California through Washington State into British Columbia. In the United States, <em>Steatoda grossa</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51082\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51082 \">picture 9</a>) is the most frequent culprit in bites while <em>Steatoda nobilis</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115811\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115811 \">picture 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115813\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115813 \">picture 12</a>) is the largest species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Europe, <em>S. paykulliana</em> is the most medical important species, although <em>S. grossa</em> and <em>Steatoda nobilis</em> also exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Australia, <em>S. grossa</em> is the medically important species, widely distributed and common in urban environments.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22850132\"><span class=\"h3\">Habitat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like black widow spiders, false black widows are found in trash and clutter. In contrast to black widows, however, they are much more likely to be found inside homes. They do not appear to have the same high-food requirement as black widows and can thus survive indoors where insect traffic is greatly diminished. <em>Steatoda</em> spiders prefer places that are not disturbed and are often found under and within cupboards.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19715450\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Widow spiders and their webs are found outdoors in garages, trash piles, potted plants, trash cans, woodpiles, dry storage areas, outhouses (developing nations and rustic recreational areas), and outdoor furniture.

Before indoor plumbing, many American and Australian bites by widow spiders occurred in outhouses. Victims were often men, and bites often occurred predominantly on the penis, scrotum, or buttocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. This has become such common-place knowledge that it was enshrined in song in Australia (&quot;There's a redback on the toilet seat&quot;). However, with the advent of indoor plumbing, there was a shift in bite location from the central genitalia to the peripheral limbs, although outhouse encounters are still a potential problem for campers.</p><p>In Europe, widow bites were considered an occupational hazard of wheat farmers who compressed the spider against their bodies as they harvested the crop and by other out-of-doors workers, including farm laborers and greenhouse keepers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>].

Approximately 75 percent of bites are on the extremities, particularly the lower extremities. Most bites are either initially asymptomatic or cause mild pain at the bite site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The time of onset of more generalized symptoms is approximately 30 to 120 minutes from the time of the bite but may be longer on occasion.</p><p>Muscle pain is the most prominent feature in systemic reactions and can affect the extremity muscles, abdomen, and back. Severe abdominal pain with abdominal wall rigidity is characteristic. Abdominal pain from a widow bite has been mistaken for a variety of abdominal surgical emergencies, including appendicitis and acute cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

There was no associated diaphoresis in this series, though it was described in a <em>S. nobilis</em> bite in the United Kingdom, closely mimicking latrodectism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-widow-spider-bites/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22850181\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A presumptive diagnosis of a widow spider bite is most often based upon the history and clinical presentation, especially in regions where these spiders are common. Significant widow spider envenomation often causes acute muscle pain and a target lesion. Local diaphoresis in the affected limb is also highly suggestive of a widow bite. If the bite is on the lower extremities, the muscular pain may extend to the abdomen; upper extremity pain may extend to the chest. (See <a href=\"#H22850146\" class=\"local\">'Black widow spiders'</a> above.)</p><p>False black widow (Steatoda) bites can have similar features but are not typically associated with diaphoresis or pain lasting longer than 24 hours. (See <a href=\"#H22850174\" class=\"local\">'False black widow spiders'</a> above.)</p><p>Of note, the diagnosis of a widow spider bite can only be considered definitive if both of the following criteria are fulfilled:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A spider was observed inflicting the bite.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spider was recovered, collected, and properly identified by an expert arachnologist, entomologist, clinical toxinologist, or other person with appropriate expertise. Identification can frequently be made from a low resolution picture. (See <a href=\"#H5681359\" class=\"local\">'Additional resources'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>If both of the above criteria are <strong>not</strong> met, then other conditions must be considered and where appropriate, excluded. A surgical abdomen, myocardial infarction, or infections with rabies or tetanus may mimic systemic symptoms of a widow spider bite. The most common disorders that are mistaken for local reactions to spider bites include infections and the bites of other insects. Widow spider bites do <strong>not</strong> become necrotic and rarely become infected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-spider-bite-an-overview#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected spider bite: An overview&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"#H22850188\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>However, these criteria for definitive diagnosis will only be fulfilled in a minority of cases and it is sometimes necessary to make a working diagnosis of latrodectism based on more limited criteria, such as the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical features consistent with latrodectism and a history of a bite by an unseen or unidentified organism in a setting where widow spiders might occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spider was seen, the description suggests a widow spider, and the patient has clinical features consistent with latrodectism.</p><p/><p>In either case, progression to treatment for latrodectism is appropriate.

Other signs and symptoms may help distinguish latrodectism from other entities. For example, patients with a surgical abdomen caused by peritonitis tend to be tired-appearing, tachycardic but with a normal or low blood pressure, and have constant pain. Patients with latrodectism are more likely to be hypertensive, hyperactive, and have intermittent muscle spasms.

Patients with rabies present with excessive motor activity, excitation, and agitation with seizures and a characteristic &quot;fear of water&quot; (hydrophobia) due to a painful, violent, involuntary contraction of pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles. In most cases of rabies, patients can report a definite bite or at least direct contact with an animal.

Patients may have autonomic hyperactivity, presenting as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. In later phases of illness, profuse sweating, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension or hypotension, and fever are often present.
