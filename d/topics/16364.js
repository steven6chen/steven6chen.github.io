Most parents start with baby cereal, fruits, vegetables, or meats.</p><p>You can mix baby cereal with breast milk, formula, or water. Make the mixture thin at first, and use a spoon to feed it to your baby. Doctors do not usually recommend putting baby cereal in a baby's bottle.</p><p>When you start feeding your baby solid foods, give your baby 1 new food every few days. That way, you can make sure that your baby doesn't have an allergy to that food. After a few days, you can try another food.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29147701\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if my baby has an allergy to a food?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your baby might have an allergy to a food if he or she eats it and then has 1 or more of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin rash or raised, red patches of skin that are usually very itchy (called hives) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79242 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen lips or face</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing or trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pale skin</p><p/><p>Call your doctor or nurse if your child has any of these symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29147708\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I use baby food from a jar?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, but be sure to follow the instructions about how long the food keeps after the jar is opened. Baby food usually keeps for 2 to 3 days after a jar is opened. If a jar has been opened for more than 3 days, you should throw it out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29147715\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I make my own baby food?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, but don't add salt or sugar to it. Babies don't need extra salt or sugar in their food.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29147722\"><span class=\"h1\">Which foods should I give my baby next?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After you give your baby different foods with only 1 ingredient, move on to foods with 2 or more ingredients. For example, you might try yogurt mixed with mashed fruit. Over time, you can give your baby foods that are thicker and have small chunks in them, like pieces of pasta or soft cheese. That way, your baby can get used to different foods and learn to chew pieces of food.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29147729\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there foods that babies should not eat or drink?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Babies younger than 1 year old should not drink cow's milk or eat honey.</p><p>Doctors also recommend that children younger than 4 years old not eat certain foods that commonly cause choking. These foods include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hot dogs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peanuts and other nuts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grapes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raw carrots</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Popcorn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hard candies</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29147736\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I give my baby juice?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can give your baby juice in a cup after they are 1 year old. But do not give your baby more than 4 ounces (120 milliliters) of juice a day. Drinking more than that can lead to diarrhea, cavities, and other problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29147743\"><span class=\"h1\">Does my child need vitamins?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors recommend that all babies who breastfeed get daily vitamin D drops starting when they are a few days old. Vitamin D helps bones grow strong. Babies who drink formula might also need vitamin D drops, depending on how much formula they drink each day.</p><p>Some babies need other vitamins each day, depending on what they eat and other factors. Ask your doctor or nurse if your baby should take vitamins and which ones he or she needs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29147750\"><span class=\"h1\">When can babies feed themselves?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Babies can usually start picking up pieces of food to feed themselves at about 8 to 10 months old.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29147757\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weaning from breastfeeding (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food allergy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=starting-solid-foods-during-infancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Starting solid foods during infancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food allergy symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
