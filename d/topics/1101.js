As aortic stenosis develops, minimal valve gradient is present until the orifice area becomes less than half of normal. The pressure gradient across a stenotic valve is directly related to the valve orifice area and the transvalvular flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, in the presence of a depressed cardiac output, relatively low pressure gradients can be seen in some patients with severe aortic stenosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of low gradient severe aortic stenosis&quot;</a>). On the other hand, during exercise or other high flow states, systolic impulse-gradients can be measured in patients with minimally stenotic or even normal valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Complete assessment of the degree of aortic stenosis requires:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of the transvalvular flow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of the transvalvular pressure gradient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calculation of the aortic valve area</p><p/><p>There is wide variability in the relationship between the severity of stenosis and symptom onset. In general, symptoms are much more common in patients with aortic stenosis when the valve area is &lt;1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> or the mean transvalvular gradient exceeds 40 mmHg, when compared with those with a valve area &gt;1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> or a pressure gradient &lt;40 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95630\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630 \">table 1</a>).

Transvalvular pressure gradient estimation utilizing the simplified Bernoulli equation demonstrates a high correlation with direct pressure measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p> &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;P</span> &#160; = &#160; 4 &#160;x &#160;(V<sub>AV</sub>)<sup>2</sup> &#160;- &#160;4 &#160;x &#160;(V<sub>OT</sub>)<sup>2</sup></p><p>where <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;P</span> = maximum pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta (mmHg), V<sub>AV</sub> = maximum stenotic jet velocity <span class=\"nowrap\">(m/sec),</span> and V<sub>OT</sub> = left ventricular outflow tract (ie, subvalvular) velocity. In practice, the minimal contribution of left ventricular outflow tract velocity (V<sub>OT</sub> is usually &le;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec)</span> is ignored, and the expression simplifies to:</p><p> &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;P</span> &#160; = &#160; 4 &#160;x &#160;(V<sub>AV</sub>)<sup>2</sup></p><p>This is the maximum instantaneous pressure gradient (mmHg) and should not to be confused with the so-called peak-to-peak gradient obtained during cardiac catheterization. The mean Doppler gradient correlates highly with the catheter-derived mean value. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-doppler-echocardiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of Doppler echocardiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, eccentric stenotic jets elude accurate recording despite meticulous technique, possibly leading to underestimation of the true gradient. On the other hand, overestimation of the gradient may result from:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mistaken identification of a jet (eg, mitral regurgitation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to consider increased subvalvular velocities (eg, in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonrepresentative jet selection (eg, a postextrasystolic beat)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Downstream pressure recovery (which is seldom a significant factor with native valves and a normal sized aortic root)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortic valve area by continuity principle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler velocities may also be directly applied to an estimation of aortic valve area by the continuity principle. Simply stated, flow volume (Q) measurements at proximate sites in a closed system (such as the heart) should be identical:</p><p> &#160;Q &#160; = &#160; A<sub>OT</sub> &#160;x &#160;V<sub>OT</sub> &#160; = &#160; AVA &#160;x &#160;V<sub>AV</sub></p><p>where A<sub>OT</sub> = area of the left ventricular outflow tract, V<sub>OT</sub> = peak velocity in the outflow tract, AVA = area of the stenotic aortic valve, and V<sub>AV</sub> = maximum velocity across the aortic valve. The effective orifice area of the stenotic valve can therefore be calculated after simple equation rearrangement:</p><p> &#160;AVA &#160; = &#160; (A<sub>OT</sub> &#160;x &#160;V<sub>OT</sub>) &#160;&divide; &#160;V<sub>AV</sub></p><p>Some experts prefer use of the left ventricular and aortic time-velocity integrals to use of the peak velocities (TVI<sub>OT</sub> = time velocity integral across the outflow tract and TVI<sub>AV</sub> = time velocity integral across the aortic valve) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p> &#160;AVA &#160; = &#160; (A<sub>OT</sub> &#160;x &#160;TVI<sub>OT</sub>) &#160;&divide; &#160;TVI<sub>AV</sub></p><p>Doppler-derived effective valve orifice area in AS increases during ejection due to the elevation in transvalvular flow, although the valve remains open for a shorter period than in normals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Effective orifice area also changes with physiologic changes in transaortic flow rate, as occurs with exercise. Measurement of this change in valve area may be helpful in the assessment of symptom onset and in the evaluation of low output AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The continuity equation may be expected to be less susceptible to flow variation because the empiric constant of the Gorlin formula is avoided. Similarly, use of Doppler-derived aortic valve resistance should be relatively free of the influence of variations in flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This hypothesis was confirmed by a study in which Doppler echocardiographic variables were measured at baseline and during an infusion of low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In another report, it was shown that acute changes in transvalvular flow do not alter the planimetered valve area obtained with transesophageal echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>However, the degree of flow dependence may be related to the structural characteristics of the valve. As an example, one study reported that more flow dependence was associated with tricuspid valves and those with morphologic features of calcific aortic stenosis while less flow dependence was seen with bicuspid valves and those with features of rheumatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Unfortunately, experience with these methods in low-flow states is limited. The severity of stenosis may be underestimated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and low-output states. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of low gradient severe aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Doppler-derived velocities have been used to evaluate the function of prosthetic heart valves. One study reported that application of the continuity equation and valve resistance provided a reliable method to distinguish whether a high velocity and gradient across a St. Jude aortic valve was secondary to obstruction or increased flow, such as may be seen with paravalvular aortic regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Parameters that differentiated stenotic from regurgitant and normal valves were the effective orifice area, Doppler velocity index, and valve resistance.

Although aortic valve resistance was strongly related to the severity of aortic stenosis, it did not add any information once the valve area and gradient were determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, aortic valve resistance was not related to surgical mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Energy loss index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with AS who have similar aortic valve areas (AVAs) may have different clinical outcomes, suggesting that other factors (eg, pressure recovery) may contribute to outcomes. The energy loss index (ELI) provides an AVA index that is adjusted for pressure recovery. The ELI can be calculated noninvasively using Doppler echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p> &#160;ELI &#160;= &#160;(AVA &#160;x &#160;Aa) &#160;&divide; &#160;(Aa &#160;- &#160;AVA ) &#160;&divide; &#160;body surface area</p><p>where Aa equals the cross-sectional area of the aorta at the sinotubular junction. In a study of 138 patients with moderate to severe AS, the ELI was superior to pressure gradient, AVA, and aortic valve area indexed to body surface area for predicting the combined end point of death or aortic valve replacement; an ELI &le;0.52 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/m<sup>2</sup></span> was the best predictor of an adverse outcome (positive predictive value 67 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Furthermore, the Doppler calculation of energy loss may correlate better with AVA measured at catheterization than does the Doppler estimate of valve area itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In another study of 1563 initially asymptomatic patients, the ELI provided independent and additional prognostic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Rate of change in aortic valve area</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of change in the AVA during the ejection phase of a cardiac cycle, as determined by Doppler echocardiography, is another way to predict hemodynamic progression in patients with asymptomatic AS. The rate of change in AVA <span class=\"nowrap\">(Md/Ma)</span> is established as the ratio of the AVA measured at mid-acceleration and mid-deceleration to the AVA at peak velocity:</p><p> &#160; <span class=\"nowrap\">Md/Ma</span> &#160;= &#160;AVA<sub><span class=\"nowrap\">t1/2d</sub></span> &#160;&divide; &#160;AVA<sub><span class=\"nowrap\">t1/2a</sub></span></p><p>where AVA<sub><span class=\"nowrap\">t1/2d</sub></span> is the AVA at time to half of the peak velocity during deceleration, and AVA<sub><span class=\"nowrap\">t1/2a</sub></span> is the AVA at time to half of the peak velocity during acceleration. An individual with a slower rate of change in AVA will have a larger ratio. </p><p>In one study of 84 patients with asymptomatic AS and an AVA &ge;0.9 cm<sup>2</sup>, rapid progression of AS (&ge;0.2 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/year)</span> was associated with a <span class=\"nowrap\">Md/Ma</span> ratio &ge;1.25 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51996 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were 64, 72, and 80 percent, respectively. The ratio was somewhat more predictive in patients with mild AS (initial AVA &ge;1.25 cm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Planimetry of aortic valve area</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Planimetry of the aortic valve orifice with transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) produces a valve area determination that has an excellent correlation with the Gorlin equation and the continuity principle described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. To visualize the aortic value with TEE, it is necessary to image the aortic valve in a view orthogonal to the stenotic jet. In one series of 41 patients with calcific AS studied with multiplane TEE, the orifice area was successfully measured in 93 percent; in the remaining patients, the stenosis was obviously very severe (&quot;pinhole stenosis&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The correlation coefficient with valve area determined by catheterization (Gorlin formula) was 0.95, and the sensitivity was 96 percent for predicting severe stenosis (valve area &lt;0.75 cm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>However, planimetry of valve area has two major limitations: measurement accuracy is limited when valve calcification is present, as occurs in most adults with AS, and it corresponds to the anatomic, not physiologic, valve area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H903122814\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER NONINVASIVE IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data on two other imaging modalities to estimate aortic valve area: cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT).

One limitation is that peak transvalvular velocities may be underestimated if phase contrast images are not orthogonal to the stenotic jet. Also, the availability of CMR is limited.

Cardiac CT may also be used to planimeter aortic valve area but this anatomic measurement does not provide data on transvalvular velocities and gradients.

Valve resistance exceeds 250 dyne seconds per cm<sup>5</sup> in critical AS.</p><p>However, more studies suggest that valve resistance does not describe the fluid dynamics of native valve stenosis because the resistance calculation assumes a linear relationship between pressure and flow, whereas the actual relationship is quadratic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/9,21,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21,34</a>].

These subvalvular gradients can constitute as much as 50 percent of the total measured transvalvular pressure gradient and increase further with exercise. The extent of elevation in cardiac output during exercise is inversely related to the subvalvular gradient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">CRITICAL VALVE AREA AND SEVERITY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Valve area and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calculated valve area depicts an effective area that does not always represent the actual anatomic area or functional impairment. As a result, some patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) are asymptomatic, while some symptomatic patients have only moderate stenosis. Nevertheless, valve area data are an essential part of the assessment of patients with AS even though there are limitations inherent in the clinical application of such information.</p><p>The term &quot;critical&quot; stenosis was defined based upon theoretical considerations showing that the aortic valve area must be reduced to one-fourth of its natural size before significant changes in circulation occur. As a result, since the triangular orifice area of the normal (adult) aortic valve is approximately 3.0 cm<sup>2</sup>, an area exceeding 0.75 cm<sup>2</sup> would not be defined as critical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. </p><p>Despite these theoretical considerations, symptoms can occur at aortic valve areas that are not &quot;critical.&quot; Many of these symptomatic patients have valve areas that are severely stenosed (&lt;1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> but &gt;0.75 cm<sup>2</sup>). However, the possibility that valve stenosis is responsible must be considered in symptomatic patients with borderline severe stenosis (eg, valve area of 1.1 cm<sup>2</sup>) if a thorough evaluation reveals no other cause for symptoms. </p><p>In some cases, it may be helpful to index valve area for body size to avoid overestimation of stenosis severity in small adults and underestimation of severity in larger adults. Guidelines suggest that an indexed valve area &lt;0.6 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/m<sup>2</sup></span> represents severe stenosis.</p><p>Of note, most prospective studies indicate that aortic velocity or mean gradient is a stronger predictor of clinical outcome than valve area. With very severe AS (velocity over 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s),</span> valve area does not provide additional prognostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Based upon a variety of hemodynamic and natural history data, clinicians generally grade the severity of stenosis as mild, moderate, severe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95630\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild &ndash; Valve area exceeds 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>; transvalvular velocity 2.0 to 2.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s;</span> mean gradient &lt;20 mmHg.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate &ndash; Valve area of 1.0 to 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>; transvalvular velocity 3.0 to 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s;</span> mean gradient 20 to 39 mmHg.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe &ndash; Valve area is less than 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>; transvalvular velocity &ge;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s;</span> mean gradient &ge;40 mmHg.</p><p/><p>Although such an assessment may be useful in clinical discussions, the absolute valve area is <strong>not</strong> the primary determinant that defines the optimum timing of valve replacement surgery. As long as there are truly no symptoms, patients with severe AS (those with a critical or near-critical valve area) should be evaluated and followed with special care. Prompt valve replacement is indicated when symptoms develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for valve replacement in aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One reason for dissociation between aortic valve area and symptoms is concurrent disease. For example, some patients may have symptomatic aortic valve disease with concurrent moderate stenosis and moderate regurgitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Indexing for body size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe AS has also been defined as an aortic valve area indexed by body surface area &lt;0.6 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Indexing valve area for body surface area is important in children, adolescents, and small adults in whom the valve area may be small but not severely stenotic when adjusted for body size. However, use of body surface area to index aortic valve area in obese individuals may produce misleading results because valve area does not scale with increases in body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Another approach to adjust for body size differences is to calculate the velocity ratio, which is the peak left ventricular outflow tract velocity (V<sub>OT</sub>) divided by the maximum aortic jet velocity (V<sub>AV</sub>). This ratio does not require a consideration of body size because it is dimensionless.</p><p>Velocity ratio = V<sub>OT</sub> &divide; V<sub>AV</sub></p><p>Alternatively, the ratio of the time velocity-integrals for the left ventricular outflow tract and aortic valve can be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">LOW GRADIENT AORTIC STENOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and a low cardiac output often present with only modest transvalvular pressure gradients (less than 30 mmHg). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of low gradient severe aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Such patients can be difficult to distinguish from those with a low cardiac output and only mild to moderate AS. In both settings, the low-flow state contributes to a calculated valve area consistent with severe AS. As an example, a cardiac output of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> and a transvalvular pressure gradient of 16 to 25 mmHg yield a valve area of 0.6 to 0.7 cm<sup>2</sup> if the standard hemodynamic formula is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, this formula is known to underestimate the valve area and should not be used alone in low flow states. In theory, Doppler-derived valve areas should be less susceptible to low flow states, but this has not been borne out in clinical practice.</p><p>It has been suggested that aortic valve resistance might provide a better separation between critical and noncritical AS, particularly in patients with low transvalvular pressure gradients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Although valve resistance is less sensitive to flow than valve area, the resistance calculations have not proven to be substantially better than valve area calculations alone.</p><p>In patients with low gradient AS (thought to be related to low flow), it can be useful to determine the transvalvular pressure gradient and calculate the valve area and resistance during a baseline state and again during exercise or other hemodynamic stress, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> infusion. This concept is based upon the observation that the valve area may increase during an increase in the cardiac output in some patients with low gradient AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. If dobutamine produces an increment in cardiac output, an increase in valve area, and a decrease in resistance, it is likely that the baseline calculations produced an overestimation of the stenosis severity.
