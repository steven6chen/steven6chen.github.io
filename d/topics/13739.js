Jugular venous access can also be used for the placement of inferior vena cava filters and other venous devices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-vena-cava-filters-and-their-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of vena cava filters and their complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Internal jugular venous access (especially right-sided) is associated with a low rate of catheter malposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and is commonly used in situations that require reliable tip positioning for immediate use, such as drug administration or transvenous pacing. Similarly, the direct route from the right internal jugular vein to the superior vena cava facilitates hemodialysis access and pulmonary artery catheter placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheters-insertion-technique-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheters: Insertion technique in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86781613\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relative contraindications to jugular venous catheterization, in general, include coagulopathy, prior access, the presence of another device at the site, and altered local anatomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Relative contraindications'</a>.) </p><p>At the jugular site, local anatomy may be altered due to prior clavicular fracture, median sternotomy, neck surgery, or neck irradiation. Following neck surgery (eg, carotid endarterectomy), the internal jugular vein generally maintains its patency, course, and anatomic relationships, but scar tissue may impede access to it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Internal jugular access in patients with coagulopathy places the patient at risk for neck hematoma, which can be life-threatening due to airway compromise if inadvertent carotid artery puncture occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, when arterial puncture is recognized, direct pressure can be applied to the neck to control bleeding, which is not the case for inadvertent subclavian artery puncture. A femoral site may be more appropriate for urgent or emergent venous access when ultrasound is not available to guide internal jugular access, in uncooperative patients who cannot lay still, and for less experienced operators. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of femoral venous catheters&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H437920391\"><span class=\"h1\">JUGULAR VEIN ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The internal jugular vein is a continuation of the sigmoid sinus as it emerges from the jugular foramen at the skull base. The vein is contained within the carotid sheath traveling with the carotid artery and vagus nerve throughout its length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74801%7EEM%2F79232\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74801 graphicRef79232 \">figure 1A-B</a>). The internal jugular vein on the right is larger than the left in the majority of patients, with significant diameter discrepancy present in over one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. As the internal jugular vein descends into the chest, its diameter increases. In a study that measured the diameter of the vein on computed tomography of the neck, the vein was on average 8.74 mm in the upper neck, 10.83 mm in the middle neck, and 12.46 mm in the lower neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The internal jugular vein exits the skull posterior to the internal carotid artery but assumes a position anterolateral to the common carotid artery as it courses beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. At the level of the cricoid cartilage, the internal jugular vein lies beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and more caudally, it is located between the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the base of the neck. In this region, the vein is superficially located approximately 1 to 1.5 cm from the surface of the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The internal jugular vein joins the subclavian vein to form the brachiocephalic (innominate) vein behind the medial clavicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The external jugular vein is a superficial vein of the neck amenable to visual identification. The vessel takes an oblique course across the sternocleidomastoid muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69353\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69353 \">figure 2</a>). It joins the subclavian vein anterior or just lateral to the anterior scalene muscle. External jugular veins are commonly greater than 10 mm in diameter; their diameter varies inversely with the diameter of the internal jugular vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85541889\"><span class=\"h2\">Landmarks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary surface landmarks for internal jugular cannulation relate to the borders of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79232\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79232 \">figure 1B</a>), which are accentuated by muscle flexion (asking the patient to raise the head off the bed), or turning the head away from the access vein. Palpation of the two origins of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (ie, sternal and clavicular heads) defines a triangular gap just above the medial clavicle. The medial sternal head is more easily palpated than the broad, flat clavicular head. The vein normally courses deep to the muscle and emerges along the medial border of the clavicular head.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85542001\"><span class=\"h1\">JUGULAR SITE SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A jugular site is often favored over other sites. Factors that influence the choice between a jugular, subclavian, or femoral site are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H3103787\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Site selection'</a>.)</p><p>The internal jugular vein is more often chosen for the placement of central venous catheters; however, the external jugular vein is an excellent choice for rapid intravenous access, or as an alternative site following internal jugular vein occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. External jugular vein access is performed in a manner that is similar to other superficial peripheral vein access, typically using an angiocatheter rather than a needle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-venous-access-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripheral venous access in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Right internal jugular vein cannulation is generally preferred over the left due to the larger diameter of the right-sided vein, its more direct path to the superior vena cava, the lower dome of the right pleura, absence of the thoracic duct, and the relative ease of access for a right-handed operator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Two single-center randomized trials found that cannulation of the left jugular vein is more time consuming and associated with a higher incidence of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, a left-sided approach may be necessary for those with prior right-sided access, excessive scarring, vein thrombosis, or those with other indwelling central venous devices.</p><p>The risk of pneumothorax is low when an ultrasound-guided technique is used to access the internal jugular vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, when ultrasound is not available to guide needle placement, we access ipsilateral to the compromised lung in patients with significant unilateral lung disease to minimize respiratory decompensation in the event of a procedure-related pneumothorax. </p><p>For patients with prior indwelling catheter placement in the subclavian veins or internal jugular veins, or a history of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis, we obtain duplex ultrasound to assess venous patency prior to attempting jugular access. This assessment can often be performed concurrent with vein localization for the operator experienced with ultrasound.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H3104738\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Preparation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232389802\"><span class=\"h2\">Equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jugular venous catheters and other jugular devices are usually placed using a modified Seldinger technique in a series of defined steps usually using a kit that contains all the materials needed for their placement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54646 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. For non-tunneled catheters, the steps for central venous catheterization are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68138\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68138 \">table 3</a>). For tunneled catheters and other devices, the steps are similar except that a sheath is placed over the guidewire, and the catheter (or other device such as pacemaker leads, filter) is placed through the sheath, which is then removed. </p><p>Prior to the placement of jugular venous catheters, assemble the following equipment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound machine (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound machine preparation'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile ultrasound transducer gel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central line kit with intravenous catheter (size and length based upon diameter and depth of vein)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile drapes, gloves, gown, surgical mask, and cap </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical antiseptic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local anesthetic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-anesthetics-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical anesthetics in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isotonic saline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heparin for flushing the catheter </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transparent adhesive dressing, tape</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous tubing and connectors (eg, needleless Luer connector, three-way stopcock)</p><p/><p>The proper functioning of any fluoroscopic equipment that will be used should be verified. Although fluoroscopy is rarely needed for jugular access, it may be useful when altered venous anatomy is encountered. When placing implanted catheters or devices (eg, pacemaker, defibrillator, pulmonary artery catheter, vena cava filter), fluoroscopy is routinely employed to measure the length of the catheter needed and to image the sheath or device as it is introduced into the vein. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H437920630\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For jugular venous access, a wide skin preparation that includes the neck and chest above the nipple line allows the operator to attempt cannulation at an alternative ipsilateral target (eg, supraclavicular or infraclavicular subclavian approach) if the initial plan fails. If difficult access is anticipated, we prepare the neck and chest bilaterally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105076091\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient positioning that maximizes the diameter of the jugular vein is associated with increased cannulation success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/9,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21,22</a>]. This is accomplished primarily with Trendelenburg position, when tolerated, and proper neck positioning. The Trendelenburg position (head down) of 10 to 15 degrees significantly increases jugular diameter compared with flat positioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/9,12,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,21-24</a>]. Placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position may also reduce the potential for venous air embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p>Most patients can be safely positioned supine or in the Trendelenburg position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. However, critically ill and obese patients may develop respiratory compromise in the supine position and require close monitoring. Some patients may require anesthesia with a controlled airway for safe placement of central venous catheters and devices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient#H386870930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the obese patient&quot;, section on 'Patient positioning'</a>.)</p><p>The diameter of the compliant jugular vein varies with the respiratory cycle. Inspiration generates a negative intrathoracic pressure, which collapses the vein, while exhalation accentuates distention. To increase the diameter of the jugular vein, cooperative patients can be asked to hum or perform a Valsalva maneuver. If the patient is not awake or is unable to cooperate, slight abdominal compression can increase venous dimension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/12,22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,22,24</a>]. </p><p>The position of the patient's head also influences jugular vein diameter and its relationship to the carotid artery. Vein diameter in the mid- and proximal neck is increased with slight head elevation while the use of a shoulder bolster or head rotation past 45 degrees both decrease vein diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The position of the head also influences the location of the jugular vein relative to the carotid artery. Some degree of overlap of the jugular vein and carotid artery is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The overlap progressively increases with rotation of the head laterally from a neutral position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/5,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28,29</a>]. Limiting head rotation minimizes superimposition of the vessels and decreases the risk of arterial puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/17,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,28-30</a>]. Although a neutral head position provides the maximal distance between the artery and vein, some head rotation may be needed to adequately expose the anterior neck. These anatomic differences may influence the success of cannulation or incidence of complications for a landmark technique, but directly seeing the needle enter the vein using ultrasound allows adjustments in real time. In a trial that randomly assigned 650 patients to a neutral (zero degrees) head position or turned (45 degrees) during ultrasound-guided cannulation of the internal jugular vein, technical success was 100 percent, and there were no significant differences in complications between these groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H437918651\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN CANNULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The internal jugular vein is generally cannulated with ultrasound guidance using one of three anatomic approaches. Following cannulation, internal jugular catheters are placed using an orderly sequence of steps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68138\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68138 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232390400\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When equipment and expertise are available, children and adults undergoing cannulation of the internal jugular vein (regardless of approach or type of needle used) should have the procedure guided by ultrasound rather than using anatomic landmarks alone. Ultrasound increases success rates and reduces the rate of inadvertent arterial puncture. The basic principles of ultrasound for guiding venous access are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access#H1232393281\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;, section on 'Internal jugular vein'</a> and <a href=\"#H1232390100\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic ultrasound-guided internal jugular access'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85542813\"><span class=\"h3\">General techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The internal jugular vein can be cannulated using an access needle with or without the aid of a seeker needle or by using an angiocatheter (catheter over needle combination). The general technique for each of these is described below. Isolated arterial needle puncture is one of the most common complications of venous access but is typically uneventful if recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Confirmation that the tip of the needle or angiocatheter is within the vein is essential prior to dilating the subcutaneous tissue and vein. (See <a href=\"#H1232387736\" class=\"local\">'Venous confirmation'</a> below.)</p><p>There is a learning curve for central venous access procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Experienced operators enjoy greater success rates with fewer complications; among both experienced and inexperienced operators, an increased number of introducer needle passes correlates with increased complication rates, which are significantly higher after two to three unsuccessful passes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If two attempts have been made, the needle should be completely removed and the landmarks reassessed, a new access site chosen, or assistance obtained from a more experienced clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/1,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,33,34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85542874\"><span class=\"h4\">Access with introducer needle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To access the jugular vein with the introducer needle:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the introducer needle into the skin and apply continuous negative pressure by pulling back on the plunger of the syringe.

This technique minimizes injury in the event of inadvertent arterial puncture. When using landmarks to guide access, we use the seeker needle for all internal jugular access; however, with ultrasound guidance to aid vein localization, a seeker needle may not be needed. </p><p>To use a seeker needle to aid introducer needle placement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As described above for large-bore needle access, insert the seeker needle while applying negative suction on the plunger of the syringe; more suction will be required (approximately 2 to 3 cc of a 10-cc syringe).

Alternatively, remove the syringe, leaving the seeker needle in place to anchor the vessel and provide a guide for venous access by the introducer needle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. While applying negative pressure to the syringe, advance the introducer needle in the same vector, or alongside the preceding seeker needle, into the vein. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85542888\"><span class=\"h4\">Using an angiocatheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An angiocatheter, which consists of an 18-gauge plastic catheter mounted on a 20-gauge needle, can also be used for initial jugular access.

The angiocatheter (not the needle) accommodates a standard 0.035&quot; guidewire.</p><p>To use an angiocatheter for jugular venous access:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attach the catheter-over-needle unit to the syringe and advance it into the target vessel as described above. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once blood is aspirated, advance the needle another 2 to 3 mm to ensure intraluminal positioning of the tip of the catheter, then advance the catheter over the needle and into the vessel. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85542669\"><span class=\"h3\">Approaches to the internal jugular vein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three approaches to the internal jugular vein are widely recognized and include central, posterior, and anterior approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The apex of the triangle formed by the heads of the sternocleidomastoid is approximately 5 cm superior to the clavicle and marks the needle insertion site. To access the internal jugular vein with a central approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Introduce the needle lateral to the carotid pulsation at an angle 30 to 45 degrees to the skin. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct the needle lateral to the sagittal plane toward the ipsilateral nipple.

To access the internal jugular vein with a posterior approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the needle along the posterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid at the junction of the middle and lower third of the muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This point is approximately 5 cm above the clavicle and is commonly marked by presence of the external jugular vein. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Introduce the needle beneath the posterior sternocleidomastoid and advance anteromedially toward the sternal notch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any subsequent changes in needle orientation should follow a systematic approach of lateral to medial needle passes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85542690\"><span class=\"h4\">Anterior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the name implies, the anterior technique accesses the internal jugular vein from an insertion point anterior to the sternal head of the sternocleidomastoid.

It has a rapid learning curve and can diminish procedure time.

Bright red and high-pressure pulsatile bleeding are important but imperfect clues to arterial puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], which can occur, although less frequently, with ultrasound-guided access. Moreover, the absence of these signs is not perfectly reliable for excluding inadvertent arterial puncture. Dark, nonpulsatile backflow of blood may be seen with arterial puncture in the face of oxygen desaturation, hypotension, or needle malposition. If there is any doubt, the needle's location can be confirmed by pressure transduction. As an alternative, a blood gas can be drawn from the accessed venous site and compared with an arterial sample; however, blood gas analysis is more time consuming.</p><p>To transduce the blood pressure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attach the needle directly to the pressure tubing system. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, replace the needle over a guidewire with a 6-cm, 18-gauge single-lumen transduction catheter (without any intervening dilation). Connect the transduction catheter to a pressure line and transducer, and evaluate the pressure and waveform tracings on the monitor. Typical venous waveforms should be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58343 \">figure 4</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a pressure transduction system is not available, attach a short length of saline-filled intravenous tubing to the needle and extended it vertically to measure the pressure, which should be &lt;10 cm in height, and should demonstrate respiratory variation. </p><p/><p>If the carotid artery has inadvertently been punctured, withdraw the needle and apply pressure over the site for 5 to 10 minutes. Jugular venous access can be reattempted provided anatomic landmarks have not become distorted from hematoma. Inadvertent dilation and cannulation of the carotid artery with a standard catheter does not usually pose a significant problem. However, larger-bore catheters, such as dialysis catheters, may be associated with bleeding or vascular complications such as arterial thrombosis and embolization. If carotid catheterization is confirmed, the catheter should be left in place and a vascular consultation obtained. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86783685\"><span class=\"h1\">CATHETER PLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most catheters and other central venous devices are placed using the Seldinger method, which refers to the use of a guidewire placed into a vessel to provide a conduit for intravascular device placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Seldinger first described the guidewire technique for arterial cannulation in 1953, and it was subsequently adopted for venous access procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232391005\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidewire handling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the jugular vein has been successfully accessed, a guidewire should be advanced through the needle or angiocatheter. Multiple types of wires are available to assist with venous access procedures. The most commonly used wire for initial jugular venous access is a flexible J-tip guidewire, favored because it negotiates curvatures and minimizes vessel trauma during passage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82419 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p>Orientation of the needle bevel and J-tip medially facilitates guidewire passage from the jugular vein into the superior vena cava rather than into the ipsilateral subclavian vein. </p><p>The guidewire should always pass smoothly and easily through the needle, dilator, or catheter without resistance. Methods to address resistance to guidewire advancement or withdrawal are discussed below. </p><p>To place the guidewire:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Position the tapered plastic introducer to straighten the distal J-tip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72306\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72306 \">picture 3</a>). The orientation of the bevel tip of the introducer needle and the J-tip of the wire can help facilitate the direction of wire placement. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain the residual length of guidewire (50 cm standard length) under constant manual control to maintain sterility and avoid its loss off the operating field. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advance the guidewire only as far as needed to allow passage of the catheter over the wire. The atriocaval junction averages approximately 18 cm from most upper body access sites, and positioning guidewires and catheters any deeper is rarely needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/4,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,43</a>]. These average values vary depending upon stature. In an Asian study, average distances were slightly shorter at 15 cm for the right internal jugular vein and 18 cm for the left internal jugular vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Advancing the guidewire deeper risks intracardiac or inferior vena cava (IVC) wire placement with the potential for cardiac arrhythmia, perforation, and snaring of other intravascular devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Never forcefully advance the guidewire, as this can kink and permanently deform the wire and risk vessel injury. The guidewire should always pass smoothly and easily thorough the needle, dilator, or catheter without resistance. Resistance to guidewire passage can be due to needle dislodgement, compression of the guidewire against the vessel wall, or anatomic obstruction. Rotating the needle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> guidewire to reorient the bevel or J-tip may relieve impingement of the guidewire on the posterior vessel wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If resistance persists, remove the guidewire and aspirate blood to confirm intraluminal needle position. Reducing the angle of the needle against the skin may facilitate guidewire passage. Once the guidewire is positioned, hold it firmly in place and remove the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance during guidewire withdrawal can be managed by simultaneous removal of the needle and indwelling wire. Continued resistance may indicate entrapment and warrants diagnostic radiography to evaluate the wire appearance and position. Withdrawing a kinked guidewire through the needle can shear off the wire, allowing it to embolize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232391012\"><span class=\"h2\">Tract dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central venous catheters are substantially larger caliber than the needle and guidewire used for venous access. Dilation of the subcutaneous tissue tract is required for catheter insertion and is accomplished by threading a single stiff tapered dilator or series of dilators over the wire to expand the subcutaneous tissue and vein. The skin and fascia catheter tract should be dilated carefully with gentle pressure. Only the soft tissue and vein wall need to be dilated. Overzealous efforts and guidewire kinking (especially with stiff dilators) risk traumatic vein injury. </p><p>To place the dilator for a standard central catheter:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the guidewire is in place, make a controlled 3-mm stab incision in the skin at the entry site with a #11 blade to prevent the dilator from catching. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thread the stiff tapered dilator over the wire, making certain the guidewire does not advance and is not pulled out at the skin exit site. The guidewire and dilator should <strong>never</strong> be advanced as a single unit, to avoid venous injury. The wire should serve as an immobile monorail over which the dilator (or catheter) is passed. Cephalad retraction of the skin may be needed to smooth out redundant neck skin to avoid kinking the wire. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the wire just above the dilator hub, grasp the dilator just above its tip, and push it over the guidewire with a firm corkscrew motion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77656\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77656 \">picture 4</a>). Mild resistance is normal. Excessive resistance may represent an inadequate skin incision, a malpositioned guidewire, or guidewire or dilator deformation. Kinking of the guidewire against the dilator is associated with vessel trauma and puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As described above with needle placement, the opening of the dilator (or <span class=\"nowrap\">dilator/sheath</span> combination) should be covered and the patient encouraged to Valsalva to prevent entry of air. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advance the dilator only to the anticipated depth of the jugular vein, <strong>not</strong> the entire length of the dilator. For the jugular site, the dilator need only be advanced 3 to 5 cm into the vein depending upon the thickness of the patient's neck.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdraw the dilator while maintaining the guidewire position within the vessel. Apply direct pressure to the exit site to maintain hemostasis prior to catheter insertion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steady traction on the wire during soft tissue dilatation helps prevent wire kinking. Rotating the dilator during advancement often facilitates tract dilatation (round dilators only). If resistance is met, it may be related to a kink in the wire, which can be remedied by advancing the wire deeper or withdrawing the kink into the dilator. Overzealous efforts and guidewire kinking (especially with stiff dilators) risks traumatic vein injury.</p><p/><p>Many indwelling tunneled jugular catheters are placed through a peel-away sheath. To place these devices, a dilator-sheath combination is placed over the wire after the tract has been dilated. The dilator and guidewire are then removed, and the catheter is placed through the sheath. Once the catheter is in place, the sheath is peeled away from the catheter and discarded. The dilator-sheath combination for large-bore tunneled catheters is stiff, and placement is facilitated with fluoroscopy, which allows imaging of the tip of the dilator and sheath, ensuring that it is placed no further into the vein than is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H1232389802\" class=\"local\">'Equipment'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662981911\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning the catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the subcutaneous tissues and vein have been dilated, the catheter is placed over the wire and positioned (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70002\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70002 \">picture 5</a>). </p><p>To place and position the catheter, thread the guidewire back through the end-hole of the catheter until it emerges from the distal port, and advance the catheter over the wire into the vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51314\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51314 \">picture 6</a>). If any resistance is met with forward advancement, withdraw the catheter and re-dilate the tract.</p><p>The initial catheter insertion depth for most adults should be 16 to 18 cm for right-sided and 20 cm for left-sided jugular catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Height-based formulas to determine insertion depth have been reported for adults and children, but there are no well-controlled studies supporting their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. </p><p>Placing a jugular venous catheter too deeply can result in serious sequelae including cardiac tamponade and central vein perforation.

(See <a href=\"#H437921236\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast to right-sided catheters, catheters inserted from the left negotiate the angulation of the brachiocephalic vein to enter the superior vena cava. For large-bore catheters used for hemodialysis or oncology, advancement under fluoroscopic guidance helps minimize the risk of central venous laceration. The risk of complications is related to the angle of catheter impingement on the superior vena cava [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. From the left, catheters positioned above the pericardial reflection can abut the weak lateral wall of the superior vena cava and risk erosion and perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>]. As such, left-sided catheters should be inserted to an appropriate length to lie parallel in the long axis of the superior vena cava. This typically requires catheter tip placement in the upper right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. It is also important to realize that catheter tips are not fixed and migrate 2 to 3 cm with head and arm movement and change in body position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232388451\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter flushing and fixation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the catheter is in place, the proper function of the catheter should be confirmed by aspirating blood and subsequently flushing each port with saline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56646\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56646 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/33,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,61</a>]. </p><p>The catheter should then be sutured into place. The short cutaneous tract (often less than 2 cm) of jugular central venous catheters requires secure catheter fixation at the skin insertion site to avoid catheter movement along the skin tract, which carries the potential for movement of the contaminated external portion of the catheter insertion into the vessel during head movement.</p><p>The catheter can be secured using 2-0 or 3-0 nylon or silk sutures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58552\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58552 \">picture 8</a>). If more than 2 cm of catheter remains exposed, it can be sutured to the skin or to a separate catheter anchor that is often included in the catheter kit. A transparent dressing should be placed over the catheter exit site to protect it from contamination. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232391295\"><span class=\"h1\">CONFIRMATION OF JUGULAR CATHETER POSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confirmation of jugular catheter tip location can use one or more of the following methods: chest radiography, ultrasound, fluoroscopy, and transesophageal echocardiography (typically intraoperative setting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/62-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-70</a>]. Chest radiography and fluoroscopy are the most commonly used methods. In general, catheters function well with the tip situated in any major vein. However, suboptimal tip position may be related to delayed complications. </p><p>Following jugular catheter placement, a post-procedure chest radiograph is commonly performed to confirm catheter position and exclude pneumothorax. However, investigators have questioned the need for routine radiography for uncomplicated right internal jugular catheters placed on the first needle pass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/68,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,71,72</a>]. When using fluoroscopy for placement, a routine chest radiograph is unnecessary unless clinical suspicion of <span class=\"nowrap\">pneumothorax/hemothorax</span> is high. If fluoroscopy has not been used, we obtain a post-procedure chest radiograph to confirm catheter course and tip position prior to using jugular catheters in non-life-threatening situations. If immediate catheter use is needed, venous positioning (but not tip position) can also be confirmed with transduction of the central venous pressure, display of the central venous waveform, or with ultrasound. Bedside ultrasound is under investigation as an alternative modality to confirm catheter placement and detect pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The optimal catheter tip position is controversial, and controlled studies are lacking. The distal tip of jugular catheters should lie in the lower superior vena cava [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. To minimize the likelihood of cardiac complications, some guidelines recommend catheter tip position outside the right atrium and above the pericardial reflection. The right superior heart border on chest radiography is not a reliable determinant of right atrial position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The carina and right tracheobronchial angle represent reliable landmarks for the pericardial reflection, and right-sided catheters should generally be positioned above this point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>]. </p><p>Malposition occurs in up to one-third of jugular catheter insertions but varies depending upon the definition of malposition. If a catheter is malpositioned within the venous system, it can be used for fluid administration under emergency circumstances but should be repositioned as soon as feasible. In contrast, inadvertent placement of a catheter into the carotid artery mandates surgical consultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a jugular catheter tip is positioned too deeply, it can be repositioned at the bedside using sterile technique.

The jugular veins are a commonly used site for central venous access. The internal jugular vein should be cannulated with ultrasound guidance using one of three anatomic approaches. Following cannulation, jugular catheters are placed using an orderly sequence of steps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68138\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68138 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H86781061\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient positioning that maximizes the diameter of the internal jugular vein is associated with increased cannulation success. For jugular venous cannulation, these include Trendelenburg position, slight head elevation, and the use of Valsalva. These maneuvers may also reduce the risk of venous air embolism. (See <a href=\"#H105076091\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When equipment and expertise are available, children and adults undergoing jugular vein cannulation should have the procedure guided by ultrasound rather than using landmark techniques alone. Ultrasound guidance improves initial cannulation success. (See <a href=\"#H105076091\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carotid artery puncture during attempted internal jugular vein cannulation is not uncommon and can be managed by withdrawing the needle and applying pressure over the site for 5 to 10 minutes. Venous access can be reattempted, provided there is no distortion of surface landmarks from hematoma. Inadvertent dilation and cannulation of the carotid artery is associated with severe complications such as carotid thrombosis and acute stroke. If arterial catheterization is confirmed, the catheter should be left in place and a vascular surgery consultation obtained. (See <a href=\"#H1232387736\" class=\"local\">'Venous confirmation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following placement of central catheters using a jugular approach, we obtain a post-procedure chest radiograph to confirm correct catheter position and assess for pneumothorax. The distal tip of jugular catheters should lie in the lower superior vena cava. The need to confirm placement in all patients undergoing jugular venous access procedures is controversial. Completion radiograph can likely be omitted following procedures performed with ultrasound or fluoroscopy guidance, particularly if access was achieved in a single needle pass. (See <a href=\"#H1232391295\" class=\"local\">'Confirmation of jugular catheter position'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an internal jugular catheter is placed too deeply, it can be withdrawn at the bedside using sterile techniques. If the catheter is not placed deeply enough or is malpositioned, the catheter should be replaced over a guidewire under sterile conditions. The portion of a catheter left out of the body is unsterile and should never be advanced into the patient.
