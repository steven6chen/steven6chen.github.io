Mucosal melanomas arise primarily in the head and neck, anorectal, and vulvovaginal regions (55, 24, and 18 percent of cases, respectively). Rarer sites of origin include the urinary tract, gall bladder, and small intestine.</p><p>In general, patients diagnosed with mucosal melanomas are older, with a median age of 70 years, although mucosal melanoma of the oral cavity frequently presents at a younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Mucosal melanoma is more common in females than males, primarily due to the development of disease in the genital tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>].</p><p>Although the incidence of cutaneous melanoma has been increasing rapidly in the United States, the incidence of mucosal melanoma has generally remained stable over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Cutaneous melanoma is associated with exposure to ultraviolet light, but the anatomic location of mucosal melanoma precludes ultraviolet exposure as a risk factor. No clear predisposing risk factors have been identified in this disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for the development of melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mucosal melanomas make up a greater proportion of all melanomas diagnosed in blacks, Asians, and Hispanics when compared with melanomas occurring in whites, reflecting the much lower incidence of cutaneous melanoma in these populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While less than 2 percent of melanomas occurring in white non-Hispanic patients arise in mucosal sites, 9 percent of melanomas diagnosed in black or Hispanic patients have a mucosal origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Despite a greater proportion of mucosal melanomas in blacks, Asians, and Hispanics, the absolute incidence of mucosal melanoma remains greater in whites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32370271\"><span class=\"h2\">Biology and management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An estimated 20 percent of mucosal melanomas are multifocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], compared with less than 5 percent of those arising in the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Approximately 40 percent of mucosal melanomas are amelanotic, compared with less than 10 percent of cutaneous melanomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Staging of mucosal melanomas varies depending upon the primary site. However, a simplified staging system, which was originally developed for melanomas of the head and neck, can be applied to all cases of mucosal melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This staging system classifies tumors into three stages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I &ndash; clinically localized disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II &ndash; regional nodal involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III &ndash; distant metastatic involvement</p><p/><p>Regardless of the primary site, wide local excision of mucosal melanoma offers the best chance for prolonged disease-free survival when technically feasible. However, complete resection with negative margins is frequently difficult because of the lentiginous growth pattern frequently associated with mucosal melanoma, the multifocality of disease, and anatomic constraints.</p><p>Most patients will ultimately develop distant metastatic disease regardless of the completeness of surgical resection. While the five-year overall survival rate for cutaneous melanoma is 80 percent, the rate for mucosal melanoma is only 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition to having an inferior outcome from the time of diagnosis, patients with mucosal melanoma may have a poorer stage-matched survival than other melanoma subtypes from the time of development of clinical metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The significant disease complications that result from primary site failure must be balanced against the morbidity of a more aggressive resection. Thus patient preferences, as well as quality of life considerations, are critical in determining the extent of surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3306310\"><span class=\"h1\">MUCOSAL MELANOMA OF THE HEAD AND NECK</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32357298\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mucosal melanomas account for less than 10 percent of all melanomas arising in the head and neck region, while more than 90 percent arise in the skin. Mucosal melanomas of the head and neck commonly occur in the following locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal cavity (most commonly involving the turbinates and nasal wall) &ndash; 55 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paranasal sinuses (most commonly involving the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses) &ndash; 15 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral cavity (most commonly involving the hard palate and upper alveolus) &ndash; 25 percent</p><p/><p>Much less commonly, mucosal melanomas arise in the pharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], larynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], or esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Patients with sinonasal mucosal melanomas frequently present with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, or loss of smell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Mucosal melanoma of the oral cavity typically presents as a painless bleeding mass, as an area of ulceration, as a region of mucosal discoloration, or with ill-fitting dentures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Approximately 60 percent of mucosal melanomas arising from the oral cavity are identified incidentally during routine dental examination. Irregular isolated areas of pigmentation within the oral mucosa must be differentiated from melanosis, a benign condition which is common in blacks and generally is symmetrical. Such lesions should be biopsied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3306317\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Work-up for patients with mucosal melanoma arising from the head and neck should include clinical examination with endoscopic inspection for paranasal disease, computed tomography (CT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the primary site of disease, and CT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to assess for lymph node involvement or distant metastases. Regional lymph node involvement has been estimated to be present at presentation in approximately 25 percent of those with oral cavity lesions and 6 percent of those with sinonasal mucosal melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for mucosal melanoma arising from the head and neck is now generally used for this subset of disease and reflects the overwhelmingly poor prognosis of this disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110810\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110810 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The AJCC head and neck stage system differs from that for cutaneous melanoma, in which prognosis depends upon the local, regional, and distant burden of disease. Staging begins at stage III as the most limited form of disease, to reflect the poor prognosis in these patients, and includes three subcategories of stage IV disease (IVA, IVB, and IVC), depending upon the local extent and presence of regional and distant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32356226\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32364903\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete surgical excision is the primary treatment for AJCC stage III and IVA mucosal melanomas of the head and neck if the lesion can be resected with negative margins. Surgery is not recommended as primary therapy for patients with lymph node involvement (IVB) or distant metastases (IVC), unless there is a need for local control of disease. Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) should be considered if complete resection is possible. (See <a href=\"#H32364415\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Mucosal melanomas of the oral cavity are approached surgically in the same manner as squamous cell carcinomas at the same site. Local resection should be accompanied by appropriate reconstruction using free flaps for mandibular, soft tissue, or structural defects. Similarly, mucosal melanoma of the larynx and pharynx should be managed by the appropriate surgical approach to achieve local control.</p><p>Craniofacial resection has been used when tumor invades the skull base, either as part of the initial presentation or as an isolated local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Endoscopic resections are being performed more commonly and may be accomplished with less morbidity and equivalent local control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Despite aggressive surgical management, local recurrence is very common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/2,15,18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,18,24</a>]. Factors associated with local recurrence include tumor size, incomplete resection, and vascular invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/15,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,32</a>]. The median time to first recurrence in the head and neck is 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/13,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24</a>].</p><p>Although the initial site of relapse is frequently local or regional, such recurrence usually is a harbinger of disseminated disease, with most patients dying of distant rather than uncontrolled local disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/2,13,23,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,23,33,34</a>]. Additional surgery can be considered for locally recurrent disease; however, the decision to proceed with re-resection for local or regional recurrence should be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of nodal disease in sinonasal mucosal melanoma is less than 10 percent; thus, elective lymph node dissection is not routinely recommended in these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melanoma arising from the oral cavity is associated with nodal disease in up to 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>], and some investigators recommend elective lymph node dissection in this subgroup of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, the regional lymph nodes can be addressed at the same time as the primary resection, clearing the first and second echelons of nodes. When reconstruction using free flaps is required, the neck must be entered and clearance of the nodal disease can be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic neck dissection in the setting of clinically evident disease can be accomplished with limited morbidity and may be performed for optimal regional control. However, no significant difference in five-year overall survival has been observed in patients with and without lymph node recurrence, suggesting that the treatment of the nodes should be based on need for local control and symptomatic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>Sentinel lymph node biopsy does not have an established role in patients with mucosal melanoma of the head and neck, although identification of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with mucosal melanoma appears to be feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32364415\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT may have a role, either as an adjuvant following surgery or when surgery is not appropriate or feasible:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local recurrence occurs in 29 to 79 percent of cases despite aggressive surgery and can be clinically devastating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/2,18,33,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18,33,38-40</a>]. Several series have reported an improvement in locoregional control with adjuvant RT, although there is no proven impact on survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/25,33,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,33,40-43</a>]. Such benefit, however, has not been observed in all series and the role of RT has not been definitively established in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/15,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,44</a>]. Some centers recommend routine postoperative RT for those with palpable lymph nodes or the finding of extracapsular extension following wide local excision and neck dissection. RT is not used if lesions are close to the eye or central nervous system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary RT should be considered for patients who are not candidates for resection or when an adequate resection margin is not possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Tumor control rates ranging from 61 to 85 percent have been reported with definitive RT in patients with mucosal melanomas arising from the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Analysis of these series is complicated by the selection bias toward the use of RT in patients with more extensive tumors and narrow or involved surgical margins.</p><p/><p>Optimal dosing and fractionation schedules have not been established for RT either as primary therapy or as an adjuvant to surgery.

Surgical management of vulvar melanomas should include resection of the primary tumor by wide local excision. Radical vulvectomy is reserved for large tumors primarily to obtain local disease control.

The excision contains all layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues, extending to the muscular fascia below.</p><p>More radical procedures are associated with significant morbidity. Although some series suggested improved local control with more aggressive surgical procedures, the impact of improved local control upon survival is limited by the concomitant development of distant metastases in the majority of cases.

While radiotherapy can lead to effective local control of unresectable disease, such therapy is limited by tissue tolerance and toxicity. Thus, alternative local therapies are needed.</p><p>The topical immune modifier <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> has been used experimentally to treat lentigo maligna and cutaneous metastases from invasive melanoma. In three patients with recurrent mucosal melanoma, topical treatment with imiquimod resulted in local control of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>]. However, regional <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distant metastases developed in all three cases (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathologic characteristics of melanoma&quot;, section on 'In situ melanoma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-basal-cell-carcinoma-at-low-risk-of-recurrence#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of basal cell carcinoma at low risk of recurrence&quot;, section on 'Imiquimod'</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/139-143\" class=\"abstract_t\">139-143</a>].

The approach has been based upon extrapolation from patients with cutaneous melanoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma#H2818027\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging work-up and surveillance after treatment of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Surveillance after treatment'</a>.)</p><p>A retrospective, single-institution study evaluating the pattern of initial metastases in 81 patients identified the most common initial sites of metastasis as the lungs, liver, and nonregional lymph nodes, regardless of the primary site of disease. The rate of brain involvement as an initial site of metastasis was 7 percent, and no primary site was free of risk. Given these data, surveillance imaging strategies for mucosal melanoma could include chest, abdomen and pelvis, and brain imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucosal-melanoma/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3306478\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melanomas may arise from the mucosal epithelium lining the respiratory, alimentary, and genitourinary tracts, all of which contain melanocytes, as well as from the skin. The most common sites of involvement are the head and neck, vulvovaginal, and anorectal regions. Mucosal melanomas generally carry a worse prognosis than those arising from cutaneous sites, with most patients developing recurrent and disseminated disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucosal melanomas are rare. Treatment recommendations for patients with mucosal melanoma are based almost exclusively upon small, retrospective studies that include heterogeneous patient populations treated at single institutions over a long time period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The standard initial management for locoregionally confined mucosal melanoma is complete wide local surgical resection, which offers the best chance for long-term survival. Most patients will ultimately develop distant metastatic disease regardless of the achievement of local control with initial treatment. Thus, patient preferences as well as quality-of-life considerations are critical in determining the extent of surgery for resection of the primary lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mucosal melanomas of the head and neck mucosal are approached surgically in the same manner as squamous cell carcinomas at the same site. (See <a href=\"#H32356226\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>More conservative wide local excision has generally replaced pelvic exenteration for vulvovaginal melanoma and abdominoperineal resection for anorectal melanoma. (See <a href=\"#H32356678\" class=\"local\">'Locoregional management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3306422\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In carefully selected patients, radiation therapy (RT) may be an alternative to control local disease when a complete resection is not feasible. Adjuvant RT may also decrease the incidence of local recurrences in carefully selected patients, although no impact on survival has been demonstrated. (See <a href=\"#H32364415\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H32356678\" class=\"local\">'Locoregional management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H32364266\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to management of systemic metastases from a mucosal melanoma is based upon the treatment of metastatic cutaneous disease. Advances in immunotherapy and targeted therapy for metastatic melanoma may offer important treatment options as more data become available, and further evaluation of therapies such as anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)-based treatments are warranted in this disease.
