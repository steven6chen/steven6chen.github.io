If the child&rsquo;s use of dissociation is repeatedly reinforced because it reduces the psychological pain related to betrayal and cognitive dissonance that arises from the abuse experiences, the dissociative response may become more automatic and more complete, eventually impeding integration of disparate aspects of identity, memory, and personality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-identity-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

Manifestations of the disorder can include alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, perception, cognition, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sensory-motor functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-identity-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Distinct personality states in DID are reported to be experienced by the patient or others as having different characteristics, such as ages, genders, sexual orientation, and abilities. Some researchers have suggested that the original personality state often constitutes the dominant presence. Four studies of 428 total subjects with DID reported a median number of personality states between 5 and 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-identity-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,23,24,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23,24,39</a>]. </p><p>Researchers reporting data consistent with a trauma model of DID have described patient presentations featuring personality states associated with traumatic experiences (with associated mood states, roles, or behaviors), such as a terrified, crying child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-identity-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>] or an angry, persecutory figure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-identity-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].

Clinicians typically need to gently inquire about dissociative symptoms, rather than expecting patients to volunteer this information. Most DID patients prefer to not think about or reveal dissociative symptoms. If patients endorse symptoms of depersonalization, derealization, and amnesia for complex behaviors, they should be further evaluated for a dissociative disorder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most clinicians do not receive training in assessing dissociation and dissociative disorders and do not assess for DID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-identity-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>].</p><p/><p>High rates of comorbidity associated with DID can lead patients to present for treatment emphasizing symptoms leading to other psychiatric diagnoses, such as depression, chaotic interpersonal relations, and somatoform symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1244394\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there are case reports and case series describing patients with dissociative identity disorder (DID) including among children, adolescents, and geriatric patients, there are no systematic, prospective longitudinal studies providing data on the course of the disorder.

The identity disturbance characteristic of borderline personality falls short of the severe fragmentation of identity, with amnesia between personality states, found in DID.

Auditory hallucinations in DID are typically highly personified, ie, related to a particular identity state, and are usually experienced as a voice inside rather than outside the head. Patients with DID have generally reported hearing voices beginning in childhood and while the disorder causes distress or functional impairment, the course typically fluctuates over time. In contrast, patients with schizophrenia typically experience hallucinations in concert with other psychotic symptoms such as disordered thinking, a flat affect, and pervasive deterioration in functioning beginning in their late teens to early twenties. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some patients presenting with auditory hallucinations, the clinician may not be able to differentiate between DID and schizophrenia initially.

DID is the more likely diagnosis if these mood states do not last more than a few hours and begin and end abruptly, often in response to environmental stimuli. A bipolar patient typically does not switch from depression to mania in a few seconds, but this would be characteristic of behavioral state changes occurring in DID. Depression is a common co-morbid condition and is often lifelong with little response to appropriate drug trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-identity-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/90,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,109</a>].

Malingering adds to this presentation the purpose of achieving some specific external advantage, such as a disability income or avoiding work responsibility. DID patients have been distinguished from DID simulators on biological measures including cerebral brain flow patterns on PET scans, heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, and emotional arousal in laboratory research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-identity-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>] and on psychological tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-identity-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/111-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">111-113</a>]. Individuals presenting with factitious <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malingered imitations of DID typically present with stereotypic &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; parts, and without the complex associated symptoms, distress and shame more common in genuine DID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-identity-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Features of the presentation that can help identify factitious disorder or malingering, distinguishing them from DID, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of an obvious benefit of the symptoms to the patient (eg, evading responsibility for a criminal act).

The rate of DID appears to be significantly higher among patients receiving mental health care, but with wide variation. (See <a href=\"#H1244373\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric conditions commonly comorbid with DID include PTSD, borderline personality disorder, substance abuse, depression, and somatoform disorder. (See <a href=\"#H1244373\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disorder has been most commonly conceptualized as occurring among individuals predisposed to dissociation who experience severe trauma during childhood. However, the disorder is controversial, and there are alternative conceptual models describing possible etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H1244380\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for DID characterize the disorder as involving switching among two or more distinct personality states and an extensive inability to recall important personal information. Some clinician researchers have suggested that DID is better conceptualized as a fragmentation of identity or as discontinuities in memory and identity rather than as &ldquo;switching&rdquo; between distinct personalities. (See <a href=\"#H1244387\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These disruptions are frequently accompanied by other manifestations of dissociation, including depersonalization, derealization, auditory hallucinations, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other dissociative symptoms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinician evaluating or treating a patient for possible DID should strike a balance between the need to ask questions about DID symptoms to identify whether or not the disorder is present and avoiding overly suggestive questions about multiple distinct personality states. (See <a href=\"#H1244401\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of DID includes intoxication, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, factitious disorder, and malingering.
