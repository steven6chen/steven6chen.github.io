(See related topics.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22661165\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analysis of stool for parasites has its highest clinical utility when caring for patients with diarrhea or intestinal symptomatology lasting two weeks or longer or during outbreaks of intestinal infection. Most intestinal infections resolve within a few days of onset, and microscopic evaluation of stool for parasites in such short-term enteritis is usually unrevealing.</p><p>The approach to organism identification via stool microscopy should be guided by the clinical presentation, including geographic exposure, age, and nature of clinical symptoms. The differential diagnosis of intestinal parasitic infection also includes bacterial and viral pathogens; in such cases, useful diagnostic tests include culture, antigen detection, fecal leukocyte count, serology, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> specialized testing for viral pathogens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Rapid antigen testing is more useful than microscopy for diagnosis of <em>Giardia, Cryptosporidium, </em>and <em>Entamoeba</em> infection. In general, the presence of diarrhea that is watery and nonbloody that occurs in association with camping, animal contact, an outbreak, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HIV infection should prompt consideration of these organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-stool-microscopy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Stool microscopy remains the primary tool for identification of a broad range of other stool pathogens. Its use is appropriate in the setting of bloody diarrhea, eosinophilia, HIV infection, bacteremia with an enteric organism, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exposure to a region where parasitic infections are endemic. Patients with eosinophilia should also undergo microscopy evaluation of other clinical specimens tailored to clinical symptoms, such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urine.</p><p>Most helminths do not cause diarrhea; for cases in which helminth infection is suspected, both gross evaluation (for proglottids) and microscopic evaluation (for eggs and larvae) are appropriate.</p><p>The diagnosis of pinworm (<em>Enterobius vermicularis</em>) is established using alternative techniques such as the &quot;scotch tape test&quot; on anal mucosa, as pinworms are not routinely found on stool examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23268382\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, fresh stool samples should be sent to the laboratory as soon as possible after collection; stool should not be refrigerated prior to receipt by the laboratory. A fresh stool sample, if still warm, has the highest yield for visualization of trophozoites (the active, infective form of protozoa). Loose stool samples must be received by the laboratory within 30 minutes to optimize evaluation for presence of trophozoites, although in many clinical settings this is not feasible. Sample collection into Cary-Blair media is a preferred method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-stool-microscopy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Because prompt receipt by the laboratory is not always possible, preservation solution should be utilized for any sample with delayed review (eg, home collection, outpatient clinics, off-site laboratories). Evaluation of stool following use of preservation solution is usually sufficient for the diagnosis of most pathogens.</p><p>Stool should be processed using a 3:1 ratio of fixative to sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-stool-microscopy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Formalin (10 percent, neutral buffered) is commonly available in hospital settings and is used in processing for visualization (formalin-ethyl acetate concentration). Among symptomatic and chronic carriers, preservation of stools has higher yield for intestinal protozoa (60 percent) than fresh examination (36 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-stool-microscopy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>To optimize visualization of cysts and eggs, formed stool samples should be broken up thoroughly in preservative prior to slide preparation. Techniques to concentrate eggs and cysts include flotation (which refers to use of a solution with high specific gravity, allowing eggs to float to surface) or sedimentation (which refers to use of a solution with low specific gravity, allowing eggs to settle to bottom). Most laboratories use sedimentation with a solution of formalin and ethyl-acetate, which preserves egg morphology and is relatively easy to perform.</p><p>Clinical laboratory procedures can be variable regarding number and types of specimens accepted. In the setting of clinical suspicion for intestinal parasitic infection, evaluation of multiple stools (up to three over a 10-day period) and use of a preserved sample may increase yield (1.75-fold) over a single stool exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-stool-microscopy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5035195\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROSCOPY TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microscopy techniques for stool examination include wet mount preparation and permanently stained slides. An ocular micrometer on the microscope is useful for making assessments of relative size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5034699\"><span class=\"h2\">Wet mount</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wet mount is a slide preparation consisting of a drop of stool (in saline if formed), with or without iodine for contrast enhancement, examined under a cover slip. The slide is first examined at low power (10x or 20x objective) in a systematic field-by-field approach for identification of helminth eggs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larvae; subsequently, these should be examined on higher magnification for <span class=\"nowrap\">identification/confirmation</span>. The slide should then be examined at high power (40x objective) for protozoan cysts and trophozoites.</p><p>For short-term storage, the coverslip can be sealed with fingernail polish or a 1:1 solution of paraffin and petroleum jelly, which requires heating to 70&deg;C.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4229859258\"><span class=\"h2\">Kato-Katz technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For quantification of helminth eggs (eg, <em>Ascaris</em>, <em>Trichuris</em>, hookworm, and schistosomiasis) in regions with high prevalence (&gt;20 percent), the Kato-Katz technique permits quantification of eggs per gram of stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-stool-microscopy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Hookworm eggs are optically clear at the edges with a dense center composed of one or more cells. <em>Enterobius </em>eggs have a distinctive oval shape with slight concavity (best seen on &quot;scotch tape test&quot;). <em>Capillaria </em>eggs are similar to <em>Trichuris </em>but are smaller with more flattened ends.</p><p>Nematode larvae recognized on wet mounts include hookworm and <em>Strongyloides</em>. Larvae should be examined carefully to determine species when possible; <em>Strongyloides</em> larva may be distinguished from hookworm larva by the presence of a short buccal cavity and primordial genitalia midway down the body. <em>Strongyloides</em> may also be diagnosed using an agar plate method in which stool is placed on media and observed for the presence of larvae (migrating).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22480083\"><span class=\"h2\">Trematodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trematode eggs recognized on wet mount with iodine include <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em>, <em>Schistosoma haematobium</em>, <em>Schistosoma japonicum</em>, <em>Clonorchis</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>Opisthorchis,</em></span> <em><span class=\"nowrap\">Fasciola/Fasciolopsis</em>,</span> and <em>Paragonimus </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93533 \">picture 2</a>). <em>Schistosoma</em> eggs are the largest of the helminths and can be distinguished by their spines, which are lateral (<em>S. mansoni</em>), terminal (<em>S. haematobium</em> and <em>S. intercalatum</em>), or vestigial (<em>S. japonicum </em>or <em>S. mekongi</em>). <em>Clonorchis </em>and <em>Opisthorchis </em>eggs have an operculum and small remnant at the opposite end. <em>Fasciola </em>and <em>Fasciolopsis </em>are also operculated but smooth. <em>Paragonimus </em>eggs are also operculated but have a thick, almost pointed opposite end.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22480089\"><span class=\"h2\">Cestodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cestode eggs recognized on wet mount include <em>Taenia <span class=\"nowrap\">solium/Taenia</span> saginata</em>, <em>Hymenolepis nana,</em> <em>Diphyllobothrium latum</em>, <em>Hymenolepis diminuta,</em> and <em>Dipylidium caninum </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F94323\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94323 \">picture 3</a>)<em>.</em> The eggs can be useful for diagnosis, although the primary diagnostic forms are the mature (gravid) proglottids and the scolex.</p><p>Proglottids are large, macroscopic structures passed in stool; they vary greatly in size as they progress from immature to gravid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F94324\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94324 \">picture 4</a>). <em>Taenia</em>, <em>Dipylidium</em>, and <em>Diphyllobothrium</em> proglottids are large (0.5 to 1.5 cm in length), while <em>Hymenolepis </em>species are much smaller (0.5 mm x 1.0 mm). Distinguishing these species requires careful gross and macroscopic examination. The scolices (the anchor) are quite small (&le;1 mm in diameter) but can be examined under a dissecting or light microscope to identify hooklets (<em>T. solium</em>) and suckers (<em>Taenia</em> species) for speciation.</p><p>The proglottids of <em>Taenia </em>have &gt;14 ovarian branches (<em>T. saginata</em>) and &lt;14 ovarian branches (<em>T. solium</em>). <em>T. solium</em> also has a scolex with hooklets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F94324\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94324 \">picture 4</a>). The eggs of <em>Taenia</em> are indistinguishable. <em>Diphyllobothrium latum</em> has a distinctive proglottid containing a &quot;central rosette&quot; that is visible with or without ink infusion preparation. <em>Hymenolepis nana</em> and <em>H. diminuta</em> can be distinguished by size of the eggs as well as the presence of polar filaments in the eggs of <em>H. diminuta</em>;<em> </em>the proglottids are very similar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22480095\"><span class=\"h2\">Protozoa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protozoa recognized on microscopy include <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em>, <em>Giardia lamblia</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, <em>Cystoisospora</em> (formerly <em>Isospora</em>), <em>Cyclospora,</em> and <em>Balantidium coli </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93539\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93539 \">picture 5</a>). <em>E. histolytica</em> may appear as a cyst form with chromatid bar. <em>Giardia lamblia</em> has distinctive flagella. <em>Cryptosporidium</em> is small with acid-fast staining. <em>Cystoisospora </em>has an oblong shape, one or two nuclei, natural fluorescence, and acid-fast positivity. <em>Cyclospora</em> is similar but larger than <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, with natural fluorescence and acid-fast positivity. <em>Balantidium coli</em> is the largest protozoan infecting humans and the only ciliate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15368495\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stool microscopy is a diagnostic tool for identification of parasitic organisms, including protozoa and helminths.
