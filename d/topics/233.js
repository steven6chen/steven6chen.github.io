Some asthma action plans include peak flow monitoring, which is an optional adjunct to clinical assessment that is most useful when a personal best baseline has recently been established using the same device. Peak flow monitoring is not used universally, because the results are effort dependent and may not accurately reflect the maximal flow. In addition, results from a systematic review suggest that symptom-based asthma action plans are superior to peak flow-based plans in reducing the need for acute care visits in children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-home-office-management-and-severity-assessment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Families who use peak flow monitoring regularly are the most likely to gain useful information when using peak flow measurements in the acute setting. The asthma action plan should include clear instructions about how to reach a healthcare provider during exacerbations.

We use two to four puffs of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a> (salbutamol) or 1.25 to 2.5 mg nebulization solution per dose, but others use up to four puffs or 2.5 mg nebulization solution per dose. Prior to use, the patient or caregiver should confirm that the medication is not expired. If using an MDI, the patient or caregiver should also confirm that the inhaler is not empty. In addition, the MDI should be primed based upon the manufacturer's recommendations in the package insert, which vary from inhaler to inhaler. Each puff should be administered separately. Actuating the inhaler into the spacer more than once before inhaling does not work as well, because the medication is more likely to stick to the walls of the chamber, resulting in less medication available for inhalation.

The dose of inhaled beta agonist can be repeated 10 to 20 minutes after the first dose, if needed (the shorter time interval is suggested if a lower dose of beta agonist was given initially). Based upon the initial response to the inhaled beta agonist, the patient should either continue self-care or seek medical attention, as described below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F93881\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93881 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5650448\"><span class=\"h3\">Good response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If symptoms such as wheezing and dyspnea resolve and peak flow measurements improve (if following peak flow) after one to two beta agonist treatments and do not return within four hours, then the patient may safely continue at-home treatment with a SABA given every four to six hours as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F93881\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93881 \">algorithm 1</a>). Oral glucocorticoids are not routinely given to patients who respond to the initial dose or two of beta agonist at home.

The caregiver should initiate contact with the child's clinician for instructions about how to continue care.</p><p>Quadrupling the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids in the setting of mildly increased asthma symptoms, rather than initiating oral glucocorticoids, may be of some benefit, although this approach has not been studied sufficiently, particularly in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-home-office-management-and-severity-assessment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Offices should have a pulse oxygen saturation monitor (transcutaneous oximetry) and supplemental oxygen available to use as needed.

The approach is similar to that used in the ED, with a few exceptions that are noted below. Treatment should be initiated in patients with severe exacerbations while arranging for transfer to the ED.

However, continuous beta agonist nebulization is usually not administered in the office setting.

Oral glucocorticoids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53629 \">table 3</a>) typically are only started in patients with mild symptoms if they have not responded to the first two doses of beta agonist, whereas they are started shortly after initiation of beta agonist therapy in patients with moderate to severe symptoms. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Magnesium sulfate</a> is usually not given in the office setting.

Peak flow measurements require maximal effort, which is difficult to assess. Poor technique can also lead to erroneous data. In addition, children younger than six years may not be able to cooperate with peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) assessments, and severely ill children may not be able to stand and provide three consecutive recordings as is recommended. Furthermore, the reading is most helpful when the child's personal best PEFR measurement is known.

This includes an inadequate response to three beta agonist treatments given in the first hour of care, although patients initially treated at home may respond to bronchodilators in the office due to issues with administration technique or, less commonly, an empty metered-dose inhaler (MDI) at home. Lack of response also includes recurrence of symptoms within four hours after the first one to two beta agonist treatments. Any patient who has an oxygen requirement after the first dose or two of inhaled beta agonist should also be transferred to the ED. Assessing response to medications should take into account how much home management a patient received prior to treatment in the office. As an example, a patient who has received no home treatment may gain more from office intervention than one who has already received aggressive treatment, including oral glucocorticoids, at home.

The decision regarding the need for hospitalization is a complex one that is based upon clinical and social factors. Patients who were moderately to severely ill on arrival and who have little improvement after initial therapy with beta agonists and systemic glucocorticoids require hospitalization. This includes patients who continue to have significant wheezing and retracting, poor aeration, or altered mental status, such as drowsiness or agitation. It also includes patients who require supplemental oxygen. Additional factors that may be used in making decisions regarding disposition include severity of previous exacerbations, adherence to medication regimen, access to care, and social support. Children are usually evaluated in the emergency department (ED) before being admitted to the hospital. The criteria for admission are discussed in greater detail separately.

The basic principles of care are assessment of attack severity, repeated use of inhaled beta agonists, early administration of systemic glucocorticoids, and frequent reassessment.

These include immediate treatment with short-acting inhaled beta agonists (SABAs), monitoring of medication response, and early administration of oral glucocorticoids, when needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F93881\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93881 \">algorithm 1</a>).

In the office or urgent care setting, the severity of an asthma exacerbation is assessed based upon symptoms, physical findings, and transcutaneous oximetry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76344\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76344 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53797\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53797 \">table 2</a>). These same measures can also be used to judge the response to therapy and determine disposition.
