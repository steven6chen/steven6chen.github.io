The most common forms of immunosuppression other than HIV include glucocorticoid therapy, biologic modifiers, solid organ transplantation, cancer (particularly hematologic malignancy), and conditions such as sarcoidosis and hepatic failure. For such patients, the clinical presentation is variable. Some patients have symptoms for up to several months prior to diagnosis, whereas others present with an acute illness of only a few days. Typically, headache, lethargy, personality changes, and memory loss develop over two to four weeks. Patients may also present with disseminated disease to other body sites.</p><p>Issues related to treatment of <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em> in HIV-uninfected patients will be reviewed here.

However, for some patients the duration should be extended for four to six weeks.

Thus, the rationale for this approach is as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Use of liposomal preparations</strong> &ndash; Liposomal preparations of amphotericin B, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a>, are preferred as first-line therapy in organ transplant recipients due to the frequency of reduced renal function in such patients (approximately 25 percent have creatinine &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and the risk of nephrotoxicity associated with concurrent use of amphotericin B deoxycholate and calcineurin inhibitors. In a prospective cohort study of 75 solid organ transplant recipients with central nervous system (CNS) cryptococcosis who were treated with amphotericin B, those who received a lipid formulation had a lower 90-day mortality on multivariate analysis than those who received the deoxycholate formulation (odds ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.57) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-neoformans-treatment-of-meningoencephalitis-and-disseminated-infection-in-hiv-seronegative-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-lipid-complex-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B lipid complex</a> has been used successfully for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in salvage regimens and is also acceptable for patients with amphotericin B deoxycholate toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-neoformans-treatment-of-meningoencephalitis-and-disseminated-infection-in-hiv-seronegative-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are fewer data regarding the use of lipid formulations of amphotericin B preparations in nontransplant patients. The 2010 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines suggest that induction therapy for HIV-uninfected, nontransplant hosts with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> (0.7 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV daily) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> orally in four divided doses). However, lipid formulations of amphotericin B with flucytosine have become the favored induction regimen for such patients in resource-available health care systems to minimize the risk of toxicity and reduce treatment interruptions, since it is critically important to complete an uninterrupted induction regimen to optimize clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-neoformans-treatment-of-meningoencephalitis-and-disseminated-infection-in-hiv-seronegative-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Combination therapy with </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> &ndash; Flucytosine is used as an adjunct to amphotericin B for the first two weeks of therapy because the combination of agents provides greater early fungicidal activity than amphotericin B alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-neoformans-treatment-of-meningoencephalitis-and-disseminated-infection-in-hiv-seronegative-patients/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. The absence of flucytosine is associated with lack of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sterilization at week two and treatment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-neoformans-treatment-of-meningoencephalitis-and-disseminated-infection-in-hiv-seronegative-patients/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Combination therapy with amphotericin B plus flucytosine also results in lower mortality compared with amphotericin B monotherapy or combination therapy with amphotericin B plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-neoformans-treatment-of-meningoencephalitis-and-disseminated-infection-in-hiv-seronegative-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most of the data regarding the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flucytosine</a> are from studies of HIV-positive individuals. In the cohort study of solid organ transplant recipients described above, there was no difference in mortality between patients who received lipid formulations of amphotericin B with or without flucytosine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-neoformans-treatment-of-meningoencephalitis-and-disseminated-infection-in-hiv-seronegative-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the number of patients who received flucytosine may have been inadequate to provide meaningful results.

However, the ultimate duration depends upon the presence of serious neurologic complications (eg, persistent headaches, seizures, ocular and auditory manifestations), radiographic evidence of brain parenchymal involvement (eg, cryptococcomas), the patient's underlying condition, and the response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4171422610\" class=\"local\">'Patients without neurologic complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H934398158\" class=\"local\">'Patients with neurologic complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H671603793\" class=\"local\">'Patients with cryptococcomas'</a> below.)</p><p>After induction therapy is completed, patients should be transitioned to consolidation therapy, then a maintenance regimen.

Serial evaluation of CSF or serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) is not appropriate for evaluating response to therapy as CrAg does not correlate with CSF sterilization at two weeks or outcome at 180 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-neoformans-treatment-of-meningoencephalitis-and-disseminated-infection-in-hiv-seronegative-patients/abstract/2,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, it can take several weeks for culture results to be finalized, and this delay makes decision-making difficult when determining the ultimate duration of treatment.

In a small prospective study of CNS cryptococcosis in transplant patients, the median time to CSF sterilization was 10 days (mean, 16 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-neoformans-treatment-of-meningoencephalitis-and-disseminated-infection-in-hiv-seronegative-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Guidelines have typically favored a four-week induction course for all HIV-uninfected, nonorgan transplant recipients, since they tend to have a worse clinical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-neoformans-treatment-of-meningoencephalitis-and-disseminated-infection-in-hiv-seronegative-patients/abstract/1,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,15</a>] (see <a href=\"#H135916236\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below); however, we feel a two-week induction course is reasonable for such patients who have had a rapid response. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For all others, we continue the induction regimen pending the results of the cultures. If the cultures are negative at two weeks, the patient can then be transitioned to consolidation therapy. Although laboratories often keep cultures for three to four weeks to detect fungal growth, most persistently positive cryptococcal cultures grow within two weeks in patients who are on therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients whose CSF cultures return positive should reinitiate (or continue) the induction regimen with serial lumbar punctures every two weeks until the CSF becomes sterile.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunocompetent hosts</strong> &ndash; On occasion, cryptococcal meningoencephalitis can occur in patients with no apparent underlying condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptococcus-neoformans-treatment-of-meningoencephalitis-and-disseminated-infection-in-hiv-seronegative-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].
