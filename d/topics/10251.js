For those patients who might feel better in sinus rhythm, rate- and rhythm-control strategies improve symptoms, but neither has been conclusively shown to improve survival compared to the other. The factors determining the choice between these two strategies are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation#H5421069\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>For those patients in whom a rhythm control strategy is chosen, catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drugs are the two principle therapeutic options.

In the studies discussed in this topic, some, but not all, of these groups have been included (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paroxysmal (ie, self-terminating or intermittent)</strong> <strong>AF</strong> &ndash; Paroxysmal AF is defined as recurrent AF (&ge;2 episodes) that terminates spontaneously in seven days or less, usually less than 24 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Persistent AF</strong> &ndash; Persistent AF is defined as AF that fails to self-terminate within seven days. Episodes often require pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm. While a patient who has had persistent AF can have later episodes of paroxysmal AF, AF is generally considered a progressive disease. In individuals with paroxysmal AF, progression to persistent and permanent AF occurs in &gt;50 percent beyond 10 years despite antiarrhythmic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation-catheter-ablation-versus-antiarrhythmic-drug-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-standing persistent AF </strong>&ndash; Long-standing persistent AF refers to persistent AF that has lasted for one year or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation-catheter-ablation-versus-antiarrhythmic-drug-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Permanent AF</strong> &ndash; Permanent AF is a term used to identify individuals with persistent AF where a decision has been made to no longer pursue a rhythm control strategy. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86382142\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITHOUT PRIOR ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUG TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) (see <a href=\"#H86379237\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above) wish to decrease the symptoms associated with the arrhythmia and choose a rhythm as opposed to a rate control strategy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation#H5421057\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.) </p><p>For most of these patients in whom a rhythm control strategy is chosen, we prefer antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy to catheter ablation as first-line therapy. However, all patients need to be informed of the possibility of recurrence of symptoms and adverse events with these therapies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AAD therapy &ndash; Commonly employed drugs are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>. Approximately 25 to 50 percent of cases will recur within one year. Important side effects include proarrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, and organ toxicity in the case of amiodarone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catheter ablation &ndash; Catheter ablation uses either radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy. Approximately 20 to 40 percent of cases will recur (defined as an AF episode &gt;30 seconds in duration) within one year. Important complications include cardiac tamponade (about 1 percent), pulmonary vein stenosis (1 to 3 percent), phrenic nerve paralysis (about 3 percent with cryoballoon), and rare instances of stroke and atrioesophageal fistula.</p><p/><p>Recurrence rates and side effects are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-trials\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation: Clinical trials&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation: Clinical applications&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations#H523855015\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation: Recommendations&quot;, section on 'Drug-related arrhythmias and mortality'</a>.) </p><p>Catheter ablation can be accomplished with either radiofrequency energy or freezing (cryoablation). Most of the randomized trials have used the former, though a randomized comparison between the two showed similar success rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation-catheter-ablation-versus-antiarrhythmic-drug-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the United States, cryoballoon is approved only for patients with paroxysmal AF.</p><p>Catheter ablation has generally not been offered as first-line therapy given the complexity of the procedure and the potential for complications. It has typically been offered to patients who have failed AAD therapy. However, for patients who are unwilling to undergo a trial of AAD therapy, we believe that catheter ablation is reasonable as a first-line strategy to maintain sinus rhythm. For example, we believe it is reasonable for younger, healthy individuals who wish to avoid the long-term use of antiarrhythmic drug therapy to choose catheter ablation as first-line therapy.</p><p>There are no randomized controlled trials comparing cryo-balloon ablation (cryoablation) versus AAD as first-line treatment of AF. The role of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) as first-line therapy for patients with AF who have chosen a rhythm control strategy has been evaluated in a few relatively small studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation-catheter-ablation-versus-antiarrhythmic-drug-therapy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In the aggregate, these studies have found a lower rate of AF recurrence with catheter ablation but at the cost of a low risk of important procedure-related complications. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The MANTRA-PAF trial randomly assigned 294 patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF and no history of AAD therapy to an initial treatment strategy of either RFA or therapy with class IC (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>) or class III (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>) antiarrhythmic agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation-catheter-ablation-versus-antiarrhythmic-drug-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Exclusion criteria included age greater than 70 years, prior ablation, a left atrial diameter of more than 50 mm, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40 percent. The primary study end points were burden of AF (defined as the percentage of time in AF on seven-day Holter recordings performed at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months) and the cumulative burden of AF (defined as the percentage of time in AF on all recordings). The following was noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the ablation group, patients underwent a mean of 1.6 procedures and 9 percent of patients were receiving AAD therapy during long-term follow-up. In the drug therapy group, the mean number of agents was 1.26 and supplementary RFA was performed in 36 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The burden of AF was significantly lower at each follow-up visit in RFA and AAD therapy groups</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There were no significant differences between the two groups in the cumulative burden of AF or in the burden of AF at 3, 6, 12, or 18 months. However, at 24 months, more patients in the RFA group were free from any AF (85 versus 71 percent, p = 0.004), suggesting that the efficacy of catheter ablation may be more durable than that of AAD therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There was one death due to stroke and three cases of cardiac tamponade attributable to RFA</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The RAAFT-2 trial randomly assigned 127 treatment-na&iuml;ve patients with paroxysmal AF to either AAD therapy or RFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation-catheter-ablation-versus-antiarrhythmic-drug-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The primary end point was the time to the first documented atrial tachyarrhythmia of more than 30 seconds (symptomatic or asymptomatic AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Flecainide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a> were the two most frequently used antiarrhythmic drugs (51 and 25 percent, respectively). The following was noted during two years of follow-up:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The rate of the primary outcome at two years was higher in the AAD therapy group (72 versus 54 percent; hazard ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.90).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The rate of the primary outcome in the subgroup of patients who were symptomatic was also higher in the AAD therapy group (59 versus 47 percent; 95% CI 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.95).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Quality of life was moderately impaired at baseline and improved to a similar degree in both groups</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serious adverse events occurred in 9 and 6 percent of RFA and AAD groups, respectively. There were no deaths or strokes in either group, but there were four cases (6 percent) of cardiac tamponade in the ablation group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Repeat ablation was performed in 13.6 percent of patients</p><p/><p>RFA appears to be more effective and safer than AAD therapy for the long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm. However, given the risk of periprocedural complications associated with RFA, there is insufficient evidence to definitively recommend RFA in preference to AADs as the first antiarrhythmic therapy in patients in whom a rhythm control strategy is chosen at this time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173203350\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH PRIOR ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUG TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173203356\"><span class=\"h2\">Paroxysmal AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) (see <a href=\"#H86379237\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above) who have failed at least one antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) and who remain interested in reducing symptoms, we recommend catheter ablation. Failure of an antiarrhythmic drug is defined as a drug trial that results in a reduction in AF burden that is not satisfactory to the patient, or results in side effects that are intolerable to the patient, proarrhythmia, or organ toxicity. Early comparisons of catheter ablation procedures to antiarrhythmic therapy were difficult due to between-study variation in patient populations, catheter ablation procedures, and outcome measures, as well as the small size of most series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation-catheter-ablation-versus-antiarrhythmic-drug-therapy/abstract/4,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-10</a>]. Three meta-analyses found that recurrence of AF occurred less often in patients who received catheter ablation as opposed to medical therapy (mostly AAD) in the 12 months after initiation of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation-catheter-ablation-versus-antiarrhythmic-drug-therapy/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The following two studies, one using radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) and one using cryotherapy, are representative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ThermoCool AF study randomly assigned 167 symptomatic patients with paroxysmal AF (no episodes lasting more than 30 days) who did not respond to at least one AAD and who experienced at least three episodes of paroxysmal AF within six months before randomization to either catheter ablation (with RFA) or AAD therapy in a 2:1 fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation-catheter-ablation-versus-antiarrhythmic-drug-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction, persistent AF, and advanced heart failure were excluded. Catheter ablation included pulmonary vein isolation with confirmation of entrance block, and AAD therapy included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> (36 percent), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a> (41 percent), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a> at the investigator's discretion. After nine months, there were significantly fewer patients with documented symptomatic paroxysmal AF in the catheter ablation group (16 versus 66 percent; hazard ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.19-0.47). In addition, major treatment-related adverse events occurred more often with AAD therapy (9 versus 5 percent) at 30 days. Mean quality-of-life scores improved significantly with catheter ablation compared to AAD therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The STOP AF trial randomly assigned 245 patients (in a 2:1 manner) to cryoballoon ablation or drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation-catheter-ablation-versus-antiarrhythmic-drug-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients had previously failed drug therapy; paroxysmal and early persistent AF were present in 78 and 22 percent, respectively. Treatment success was defined as freedom from chronic treatment failure, as defined by the absence of: any detectable AF after the blanking period; use of a non-study antiarrhythmic drug; and any non-protocol intervention for AF. At 12 months, the primary end point was present in 69.9 and 7.3 percent of the two groups (p&lt;0.001). Serious adverse procedure-related events occurred in 3.1 percent. Phrenic nerve palsy occurred in 11.2 percent, but resolved in the majority.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173203379\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with persistent AF (see <a href=\"#H86379237\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above) have generally been excluded from studies comparing AAD to RFA. Based on limited evidence, we believe it is reasonable to offer RFA to these individuals who have failed a trial of AAD. </p><p>The SARA study, which is the only randomized comparison in this population, randomly assigned 146 patents with persistent AF (excluding individuals with long-standing persistent AF) who were refractory to at least one AAD to RFA or AAD therapy in a 2:1 manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation-catheter-ablation-versus-antiarrhythmic-drug-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> and class IC drugs were most commonly prescribed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 1</a>). The primary end point was any episode of AF or atrial flutter lasting &gt;24 hours that occurred during nine months of follow-up (after three-month blanking period). Freedom from the primary end point occurred more often with RFA (70.4 versus 43.7 percent). The study was terminated prematurely due to slow enrollment, thus limiting the validity of its conclusions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86379335\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations for the use of catheter ablation are available in societal guidelines.
