The LQTS can be inherited or acquired as an adverse response to medication, metabolic abnormalities, or bradyarrhythmias. Torsades de pointes (TdP) or &quot;twisting of points&quot; is the specific type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) associated with either form of the LQTS.

Hundreds of mutations in more than 10 genes have thus far been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Distinct genetic types have been designated LQT1 through LQT10 and additional genetic types have been identified.</p><p>Long QT syndrome can also be an acquired disorder, most often due to drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 2</a>). In some patients, drug-associated LQTS appears to represent a &quot;forme fruste&quot; of congenital LQTS in which a mutation or polymorphism in one of the LQTS genes is clinically inapparent until the patient is exposed to a particular drug or other predisposing factor. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Mutations in acquired LQTS'</a> below.)</p><p>The genetics of congenital and acquired LQTS will be reviewed here. The clinical features and criteria used to make the diagnosis of congenital long QT syndrome and the characteristics of acquired LQTS are discussed elsewhere.

A recessive form of the Romano-Ward syndrome has been described in one family of individuals homozygous for mutations in the KVLQT1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait and is characterized clinically by LQTS and sensorineural deafness.

These encode the alpha and beta subunits of the slowly acting component of the outward-rectifying potassium current (IKs). This variant has been associated with a more malignant course.

LQT1 accounts for approximately 30 to 35 percent of LQTS, LQT2 for 25 to 40 percent, and LQT3 for 5 to 10 percent, with the remaining 10 types accounting for &lt;5 percent of LQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">LQT type 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first association between a chromosomal marker and congenital LQTS was identified by analysis of a Utah family with a high prevalence of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Linkage was found between the LQTS phenotype and a marker on the short arm of chromosome 11. Investigators using positional cloning techniques identified the involved gene and named it KVLQT1 (also called KCNQ1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>LQT1 accounts for 30 to 35 percent of cases of the LQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most patients with this defect show paradoxical prolongation of the QT interval after an infusion of epinephrine, which can also be used to unmask latent mutation carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In a 14-year old boy who arrested during exercise, the QTc was initially borderline; the administration of epinephrine markedly increased the QTc (442 to 585 msec) and led to a spontaneously terminating TdP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The protein product of KVLQT1 (alpha-subunit), when coexpressed with the cardiac protein minK (IsK or beta-subunit, which is encoded by KCNE1), forms the slowly acting component of the outward-rectifying potassium current (IKs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Suppression of IKs by mutations in the KVLQT1 gene, in the absence or presence of minK, can be correlated with and likely underlie prolongation of human ventricular action potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Mutations in the gene for minK (LQT5), produces a similar defect in IKs (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'LQT type 5'</a> below). Gain-of-function mutations in KVLQT1 have been associated with familial atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and with the congenital short QT syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease#H454144638\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden cardiac arrest in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;, section on 'Short QT syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation#H262710391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a>.)</p><p>Many missense mutations, and some other types of mutations, have been identified in KVLQT1. The severity of the clinical features of LQT1 vary with the specific mutation. In particular, mutations in the transmembrane region are associated with more frequent cardiac events (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death) than mutations in the C-terminal region (55 versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>A mutation KVLQT1-A341V (also called KCNQ1-A341V) is associated with high clinical severity independent of ethnic origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In a study comparing 244 A341V patients with 205 non-A341V LQT1 patients at a median follow-up of approximately 30 years, A341V patients were significantly more likely to have cardiac events (75 versus 24 percent), were younger at first event (6 versus 11 years), and had a longer QTc (485 &plusmn; 43 versus 465 &plusmn; 38 msec).</p><p>Homozygous mutations of KVLQT1 appear to cause the Jervell-Lange-Nielsen syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Studies in which the KVLQT1 gene is disrupted in mice suggest that KVLQT1 is required for normal development of the inner ear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Deafness can also be induced by the loss of functional minK protein, which seems to disrupt the production of endolymph.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">LQT type 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LQT2, which accounts for 25 to 40 percent of cases of congenital LQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/12,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,26,27</a>], is caused by a variety of mutations in a different potassium channel gene, localized to chromosome 7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. The implicated gene is called KCNH2 (formerly HERG), the function of which is the rapidly acting component of the outward-rectifying potassium current (IKr) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. This current is largely responsible for repolarization and thus the QT interval duration. The KCNH2 channel has unique electrophysiologic features that may normally protect against early afterdepolarizations (EADs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Virtually all of the drugs that cause acquired LQTS block the IKr current mediated by KCNH2. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Mutations in acquired LQTS'</a> below.)</p><p>The mutations may involve the pore or the nonpore region of the KCNH2 channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35</a>]. In a study of 201 patients, those with mutations at the pore region had a significantly greater risk of a cardiac event (74 versus 35 percent with mutations in the nonpore region) and of SCD or aborted cardiac arrest (15 versus 6 percent); these manifestations occurred at an earlier age in the patients with mutations in the pore region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. With multivariate analysis, patients with the pore mutation had a significantly greater risk of a cardiac event at a QTc of 500 ms (hazard ratio 11); each 10 ms change in the QTc above or below 500 ms increases or decreases the risk by 16 percent.</p><p>In some reports, nonpore mutations are more likely to be associated with TdP in the presence of hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, a malignant phenotype has been described in a family with a novel mutation in the nonpore region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Short QT syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A mutation in the KCNH2 gene that increases IKr has been identified in two families with the congenital short QT syndrome.

Mutations in at least two families involve a nine base pair deletion in a region of the sodium channel gene that causes impaired inactivation of the channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The abnormal sodium channel fails to inactivate only 3.5 percent of the time, suggesting that even infrequent dysfunction can result in the clinical phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Impaired sodium channel inactivation keeps the membrane slightly depolarized through slow leakage of sodium current into the cell, possibly resulting in membrane instability and early afterdepolarizations (EADs).</p><p>Sporadic (de novo) SCN5A mutations have also been described in which neither parent had either the mutation or a long QT interval. In contrast to the heritable mutations, one of these mutations resulted in a prolonged opening and early reopening of the sodium channel and therefore a threefold prolongation of sodium current decay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Mutations in SCN5A have been associated with sudden infant death syndrome, at least some of which are sporadic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].

Although shortening of repolarization and the QT interval occurred in 12 of these patients, 6 (46 percent) developed ST segment elevation in V1 through V3, compatible with Brugada syndrome.</p><p>A specific polymorphism in SCN5A (referred to as both Y1102 and S1103Y) is present in approximately 13 percent of African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. It is associated with accelerated sodium channel activation, produces only a small increase in arrhythmia risk, and most affected subjects never develop arrhythmia. However, they may be at risk for long QT syndrome and potentially life-threatening arrhythmia if other factors are superimposed such as hypokalemia or certain drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>In addition, it seems likely that at least some individuals with this polymorphism are at increased risk for sudden death independent of other risk factors.

Ankyrin-B is a plasma membrane protein that physically links the lipid bilayer to the membrane skeleton; it is the first protein associated with LQTS that is not an ion channel or channel subunit. Individuals with this mutation have marked sinus node dysfunction, sinus bradycardia or junctional escape rhythm, and episodes of atrial fibrillation.

As noted above, this protein, when combined with the product of the KVLQT1 gene, forms the slowly acting component of the outward-rectifying potassium current. Homozygous mutations in KCNE1 have been reported to cause the Jervell-Lange-Nielsen syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">LQT type 6</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LQT6 is the result of a mutation in the minK related peptide 1 (MiRP1 or KCNE2) gene on chromosome 21q22.1-22.2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

However, such testing is subject to limitations given the complexity and heterogeneity of the disorder. It has been estimated that a specific mutation in one of the three major genes (KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A) can be identified in approximately 75 percent of patients presenting with LQTS and that a mutation can be identified in as many as 80 percent patients when testing includes all known disease-associated genes that have been included in commercial disease gene panels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

This was demonstrated in a report of 430 probands with Romano-Ward syndrome evaluated at a referral center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The entire coding regions for LQT 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 (KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2) were analyzed in each patient. Mutations were defined as any nucleotide change that altered the protein product and that was not present in 400 controls. The following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>310 probands (72 percent) were identified as carriers of 235 distinct mutations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>138 of these mutations had not been reported previously.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>64 codons of KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A were identified as frequent sites of mutations. 58 percent of the mutations occurred in these codons, although they represent less than 4 percent of the codons in these genes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defining LQTS as a QTc &gt;440 msec in men and 460 msec in women, the average QTc penetrance in genetically affected family members was 60 percent.</p><p/><p>Thus, this exhaustive evaluation yielded a high percentage of genetic diagnoses and uncovered a large number of novel mutations. However, the authors acknowledge that this approach may be impractical in clinical settings. As a result, they suggested a multitiered approach, with progressively more comprehensive genetic testing in three stages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial testing would focus on the smaller number of genetic sites with frequent mutations, and testing could stop once a defect was found. For example, in suspected cases of LQTS, the 64 frequently mutated codons should be genotyped, which could yield diagnoses in 40 to 50 percent of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If no mutations were found in the initial stage, the entire coding region of KCNQ1 and KCNH2 (LQT 1 and 2) should be screened, since these account for more than 80 percent of cases if LQTS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who test negative in the second stage, full genotyping for less common mutations in SCN5A, KCNE1 and KCNE2 could be done.</p><p/><p>An important limitation of this multitiered approach is that 4.5 percent of the probands in this study and 7.9 percent in another had mutations in two LQTS genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. In such cases, if one mutation is identified in an early stage, the second would not be detected. This could alter management recommendations for the affected patient. Furthermore, since family screening is limited to an identified disease-causing gene, the failure to identify a second locus could prevent detection of affected family members. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Compound mutations'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients with a confirmed or suspected clinical diagnosis of LQTS, genetic diagnosis could have important implications for both management decisions and family members. However, the clinical relevance and phenotypic expression of genetic mutations in patients without known arrhythmias is uncertain. In a multicenter cohort of 2022 patients who underwent DNA sequencing including SCN5A and KCNH2 genes, 223 persons (11 percent) were identified to have rare variants, among who 63 persons were felt to have a potentially pathogenic mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. When diagnosis codes and electrocardiographic data were analyzed, there was no significant difference between patients with and without potentially pathogenic mutations in the frequency of arrhythmia diagnosis (17 versus 13 percent) or in the corrected QT interval (median 429 versus 439 milliseconds). The study was limited in that only two cardiovascular genes (SCN5A and KCNH2) were studied and the diagnosis data were extracted from medical records. However, this does call in to question the utility of screening asymptomatic family members following the identification of an index case.</p><p>We agree with the 2011 Heart Rhythm <span class=\"nowrap\">Society/European</span> Heart Rhythm Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(HRS/EHRA)</span> expert consensus statement recommendations for genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Virtually all of the drugs that produce LQTS act by blocking the IKr current mediated by the potassium channel encoded by the KCNH2 gene. As noted above, mutations in KCNH2 are responsible for LQT2. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H3352126834\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Importance of KCNH2 blockade'</a>.)</p><p>In some patients, drug-associated LQTS appears to represent a &quot;forme fruste&quot; of congenital LQTS in which a mutation or polymorphism in one of the LQTS genes is clinically inapparent until the patient is exposed to a particular drug or other predisposing factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/1,55,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,55,72,73</a>]. It has been suggested that there is a redundancy in repolarizing currents that has been called repolarization reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. This could explain why a given mutation might be associated with clinical disease only when another insult, such as a drug, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia, is superimposed.</p><p>The frequency with which patients with drug-associated LQTS and TdP have an underlying predisposition to such events was evaluated in a series of 92 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The culprit drugs were antiarrhythmic drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>) in 77 percent and nonantiarrhythmics in 23 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 2</a>). Genetic screening was performed for LQTS types 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. Mutations in LQT1, LQT2, or LQT3 were identified in five patients (5.4 percent) and gene polymorphisms that might contribute to risk were identified in another 5 to 10 percent. In addition, all but 10 patients had an underlying risk factor for TdP (heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia). It was estimated that 1 in 1000 to 3000 individuals is a carrier of an LQTS mutation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other reports have also identified a genetic predisposition to drug-induced TdP due to mutations or polymorphisms in the genes responsible for LQT1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/22,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,75</a>], LQT3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>], and LQT6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>Unaffected family members may carry silent mutations on LQTS genes (ie, they are carriers of mutated genes with low penetrance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/22,72,78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,72,78,79</a>]. This was illustrated in a study of nine families with sporadic cases of LQTS; 15 of 46 family members (33 percent) who were felt to be unaffected based upon clinical criteria were gene carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In such individuals, the LQTS mutations may produce an alteration in repolarizing currents that is insufficient to prolong the QT interval at rest. However, these silent gene carriers and their affected offspring might be at risk for unexpected TdP if exposed to drugs that can prolong the QT interval.</p><p>In addition, common genetic variations associated with modest changes in QT interval duration have been identified. As examples, common variants of the KCNH2 gene encoding the alpha subunit of the KCNH2 channel are associated with 3 to 4 msec increases in QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>], and common variants of the NOS1AP myocardial repolarization gene are associated with an approximately 7 msec increase in QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19875495\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least 13 types of congenital LQTS have been identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F114927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114927 \">table 1</a>).
