There are different types of lung cancer. Some types grow faster than others.</p><p>Small cell lung cancer is 1 type of lung cancer. It is typically fast growing. Most people who get small cell lung cancer are people who smoke or used to smoke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717811\"><span class=\"h1\">What is lung cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out how far in your body a cancer has spread. To describe how far a person's small cell lung cancer has spread, doctors use the words &quot;limited&quot; or &quot;extensive.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with<strong> limited</strong> <strong>disease</strong> have lung cancer on 1 side of the chest, either in the right lung or in the left lung.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with<strong> extensive disease</strong> have lung cancer on both sides of the chest (in the right and left lungs). Or their lung cancer has spread to other parts of the body.</p><p/><p>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the stage of your lung cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717818\"><span class=\"h1\">How is limited lung cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with limited small cell lung cancer are usually treated with both chemotherapy and radiation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> &ndash; Chemotherapy is the term doctors use to describe a group of medicines that kill cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiation therapy</strong> &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells. Most people get radiation therapy at the same time as their chemotherapy treatment. But some people start radiation therapy after their chemotherapy is done. Usually, people have radiation aimed at the lungs. This can kill the cancer in the lungs. But people might also have radiation that is aimed at the brain, even if they do not have cancer in the brain. That's because brain radiation can reduce the chance that the cancer will spread to the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717825\"><span class=\"h1\">How is extensive lung cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with extensive small cell lung cancer are usually treated with chemotherapy.</p><p>After chemotherapy, some people have treatment with radiation therapy to the lungs. Sometimes, people also have radiation therapy to the brain to prevent the cancer from spreading to the brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717832\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor will check every so often to see if your lung cancer has come back or is growing. Follow-up tests usually include exams and imaging tests such as chest X-rays or CT scans. Imaging tests can create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>In most people treated for limited disease, small cell lung cancer comes back within 1 to 2 years. For people with extensive disease, treatment usually cannot cure the cancer. But it can help people live a little longer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717839\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the lung cancer comes back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the lung cancer comes back, you might get different chemotherapy medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717846\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I smoke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you smoke, you should try to quit. People who survive lung cancer have a greater chance of getting lung cancer again if they smoke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717853\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for lung cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have and when.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Anytime you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717980\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lung cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-cell-lung-cancer-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Small cell lung cancer treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-prevention-and-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lung cancer prevention and screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-risks-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lung cancer risks, symptoms, and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
