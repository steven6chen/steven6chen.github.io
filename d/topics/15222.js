Since most patients with STEMI undergo reperfusion therapy, early risk stratification provides the patient and family with some sense of what the future holds. Late risk stratification attempts to identify patients who are at increased risk for late arrhythmic or nonarrhythmic death.</p><p>The general approach to risk stratification for patients with STEMI will be reviewed here. Risk stratification is accomplished with the use of validated risk prediction models that include the most important predictors of outcome. These individual predictors are discussed separately.

The variables incorporated into this model include age, prior history of heart failure, prior history of myocardial infarction, resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, ST-segment depression, initial serum creatinine concentration, elevated serum cardiac biomarkers, and performance of in-hospital percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The six-month mortality risk based upon this model can be calculated using the website <a href=\"http://www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace&amp;token=erEtv2h4SKbehy52hBNFQ4C8qBxX5+oV2yJv4xO+cQvqZ3KtcjD33FVtKC7qUs6U&amp;TOPIC_ID=78\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183452799\"><span class=\"h2\">CHADS2 score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the GRACE prediction model is well validated and its use is recommended by multiple guideline organizations, its complexity makes it somewhat difficult to use in some clinical settings. The value of the CHADS2 score, which is a well validated tool for predicting the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, was evaluated in a study of more than 2300 patients with ACS (37 percent with STEMI; 19 percent with atrial fibrillation [AF]) cared for between 1995 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-stratification-after-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. All-cause mortality at 10 years was strongly associated with the CHADS2 score in patients with and without AF. As expected, the more complex GRACE score provided a better prediction for short- and long-term mortality.

Multivariable analyses of data from 243,440 patients showed that greater heart rate, lower systolic blood pressure, life-threatening presentations (cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, or heart failure), STEMI at presentation, lower creatinine clearance, and higher troponin values were associated with death during the hospitalization.

Echocardiography is preferred to magnetic resonance imaging in the European guideline, while the United States guideline makes no preference for the type of imaging modality. Patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction have increased mortality at six months and one year (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75743\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75743 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68071\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68071 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-stratification-after-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. The increase in mortality is most pronounced in the minority of patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &le;30 percent. In addition, patients with LVEF &le;35 percent are at increased risk for sudden cardiac death after MI and should be considered candidates for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

However, measurements during hospitalization may be misleading, since improvement in LVEF, beginning within three days and largely complete by 14 days, is common in patients who are reperfused. Two separate studies have shown that approximately 58 percent of patients significantly improve LVEF after reperfusion in acute STEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-stratification-after-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

In general, echocardiography should be used for routine assessment of LVEF after acute MI. It has the added advantage of detecting other factors that can be associated with a worse prognosis such as diastolic dysfunction, concurrent right ventricular dysfunction, left atrial enlargement, mitral regurgitation, and a high wall motion score index, which reflects a more severe impairment in overall left ventricular systolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-stratification-after-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/29-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-35</a>].
