These changes usually go away after an hour or two. Some people get a lot of swelling around the sting that can last for days. This is called a &quot;large local reaction.&quot; It is not dangerous, and it is not the same as an allergic reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23545699\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an allergic reaction to an insect sting?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have an allergy to insect venom, the sting can cause a normal reaction (pain, swelling, and redness around the sting) <strong>plus</strong> other symptoms throughout your body. These symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flushing &ndash; Flushing is when your skin turns red and feels hot, especially on your face.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hives &ndash; These are red, raised patches of skin that are very itchy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79242 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioedema &ndash; This is swelling of the face, eyelids, mouth, tongue, hands, and feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F108757\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108757 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p>Some people have a more serious reaction, called &quot;anaphylaxis.&quot; <strong>Call for an ambulance (in the United States and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if you are stung by an insect and you suddenly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble breathing, become hoarse, or start wheezing (hear a whistling sound when you breathe)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start to swell, especially in the throat or around the face, eyelids, mouth, hands, or feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Develop belly cramps, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel dizzy or pass out</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23545714\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for an insect allergy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you had a severe reaction after an insect sting, you should see an allergy specialist. You will need a blood or skin test, or sometimes both tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23545729\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an insect allergy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergy shots &ndash; These shots will make you much less likely to have a serious reaction if you get stung again. You will likely get shots 1 to 3 times a week for a few months. After that, you will get a shot once a month for at least 3 years. Some people get monthly shots up to 5 years or longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Epinephrine</a> &ndash; This medicine helps stop the symptoms of an allergic reaction. It comes in pre-filled injectors, so you can give yourself an injection (shot) if needed. If you had a serious reaction to an insect sting in the past, you should always carry at least one epinephrine injector at all times.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23545744\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to reduce the chances of getting stung?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay calm and slowly back away if you see a stinging insect. Do not wave your arms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep foods and drinks covered when you are outside, and clean up any spills right away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid wearing sandals and open-toed shoes in the summer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid doing things that might disturb an insect nest, such as mowing the lawn or pruning a hedge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you find an insect nest in or near your house, call a pest-control service to get rid of the nest safely. Do not try to do it yourself.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you live in an area that has fire ants, avoid stepping on ant mounds and wear shoes and socks when outside.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23545761\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites-and-stings-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insect bites and stings (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bee-and-insect-stings-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bee and insect stings (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imported-fire-ants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Imported fire ants (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-treatment-and-prevention-of-recurrences-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis treatment and prevention of recurrences (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-an-epinephrine-autoinjector-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Use of an epinephrine autoinjector (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
