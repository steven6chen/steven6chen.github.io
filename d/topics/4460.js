Affected patients may present with respiratory distress in the newborn period or may remain asymptomatic until later in life. Many cases are now detected by routine prenatal ultrasound examination. Surgical resection is the definitive treatment.</p><p>The clinical presentation and postnatal management of CPAM is discussed below. Prenatal diagnosis, course, and management of CPAM are discussed in a separate topic review.

Although rare, it is the most common congenital lung lesion. The widespread use of antenatal ultrasound examination has resulted in an increase in the prenatal diagnosis of CPAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Data from large population registries suggest an incidence of congenital lung cysts in the range of 1 per 8300 to 35,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Large-cyst subtypes account for about 70 percent of CPAMs, or 2 to 8 per 100,000 live births.</p><p>CPAMs occur sporadically. Their formation is not related to maternal factors such as race, age, or exposures. In some series, lesions that present in infancy have a slight male preponderance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>], although others found no gender predilection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. There is no known genetic predisposition, with the exception of type 4 malformations, which have been associated with a familial pleuropulmonary blastoma syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Pleuropulmonary blastoma'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) result from abnormalities of branching morphogenesis of the lung. The different types of CPAMs are thought to originate at different levels of the tracheobronchial tree and at different stages of lung development, possibly influenced by in utero airway obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atresia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Types'</a> below.)</p><p>The molecular mechanisms resulting in CPAM formation are unknown but may include an imbalance between cell proliferation and apoptosis during organogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Disorders of the HOXB5 gene have been implicated in this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. One study found that CPAMs resected from fetuses and newborns had twice as much cell proliferation and five times the number of apoptotic bodies as did normal fetal and neonatal lung tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>This process may be mediated in part by glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a growth factor that is widely expressed in organs with development characterized by epithelial-mesenchymal interaction. In one report, GDNF was detected in epithelial and endothelial cells from normal fetal lung and in epithelial cells from CPAMs, while none was found in normal lung tissue obtained from older infants and children (four months to three years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Vascularity was also reduced in CPAMs compared with normal lung tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) are hamartomatous lesions that are comprised of cystic and adenomatous elements arising from tracheal, bronchial, bronchiolar, or alveolar tissue. Large lesions can compromise alveolar growth and development by compressing adjacent normal tissue.</p><p>CPAMs have connections with the tracheobronchial tree, although the connecting bronchi usually are not normal. The arterial supply and venous drainage from the lesion are almost always from the pulmonary circulation, though vascular connections to the systemic circulation have been reported.</p><p>CPAMs are equally distributed between the right and left lungs and can arise in all lobes. Lesions are usually limited to one lobe, but infrequently they can involve multiple lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,10</a>]. The CPAMs that present during adulthood tend to be in the lower lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Types</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CPAMs were previously known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAMs) which were divided into three major types based upon the size of the cysts and their cellular characteristics (predominantly bronchial, bronchiolar, or <span class=\"nowrap\">bronchiolar/alveolar</span> duct cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Under this classification scheme, more than 65 percent of CPAMs were type 1, type 2 comprised 20 to 25 percent, and type 3 comprised 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>In the present classification scheme these congenital cystic lung lesions are now called CPAM, and two additional types (0 and 4) were added. Type 0 arises from the trachea, and type 4 lesions have <span class=\"nowrap\">alveolar/distal</span> acinar origins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>Each type of CPAM has distinct pathologic characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 0</strong> &ndash; Type 0 is the rarest form, comprising only 1 to 3 percent of cases, and originates from tracheal or bronchial tissue. The cysts are small, with a maximum diameter of 0.5 cm, and are lined with ciliated pseudostratified epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Mucus cells and cartilage are present, but skeletal muscle is absent. This is a diffuse malformation that involves the entire lung. Gas exchange is severely impaired, and affected infants die at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 1</strong> &ndash; Type 1 is the most common form of CPAM, comprising 60 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This type is thought to originate from the distal bronchi or proximal bronchioles. Because there is well-differentiated tissue within the lesions, this type probably originates relatively late during embryogenesis (7 to 10 weeks).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Type 1 lesions are comprised of distinct thin-walled cysts 2 to 10 cm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69459\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69459 \">picture 1</a>). The cysts are usually single but may be multiloculated. They are lined with ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82204\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82204 \">picture 2</a>) and the walls contain smooth muscle and elastic tissue. Mucus-producing cells are present in approximately one-third of cases, and a thin fibromuscular layer may be present under the epithelium. Small islands of abnormal cartilage are found in 5 to 10 percent of lesions. The adjacent alveoli are relatively normal, and in 95 percent of cases, only one lobe of the lung is involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This type of CPAM has malignant potential, but the magnitude of the risk is not well delineated. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Association with malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinical presentation of type 1 CPAMs depends primarily on the size of the cysts. Large cysts may be detected on prenatal ultrasound. If they compress adjacent normal lung they can cause respiratory distress in the neonate, mediastinal shift to the contralateral side, and flattening of the ipsilateral diaphragm. Smaller cysts may present months or years after birth as incidental lesions or a focus of infection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 2</strong> &ndash; Type 2 lesions comprise 15 to 20 percent of CPAMs. They consist of multiple cysts 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter and solid areas that blend into adjacent normal tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54211\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54211 \">picture 3</a>). The cysts resemble dilated terminal bronchioles and are lined with ciliated cuboidal or columnar epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66962\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66962 \">picture 4</a>). Type 2 lesions may also have a thin fibromuscular layer with an increase in elastic tissue. Mucus-secreting cells and cartilage are absent. There is usually little mass effect on the adjacent lung. Extralobar pulmonary sequestrations may have a similar appearance, but unlike type 2 CPAM, these have a systemic blood supply. Hybrid forms, with features of both type 2 CPAM and extralobar pulmonary sequestrations, have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchopulmonary-sequestration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchopulmonary sequestration&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other congenital anomalies are observed in patients with type 2 CPAM in up to 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/5,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27</a>]. These malformations include esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], bilateral renal agenesis or dysgenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], intestinal atresia, other pulmonary malformations, and diaphragmatic, cardiac, central nervous system, and bony anomalies. This association with other congenital malformations suggests that insults resulting in type 2 CPAMs occur during the third week of gestation. In many cases, the associated anomalies are the presenting feature, and the CPAM is detected as a secondary finding. Type 2 CPAMs are not at risk for development of malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 3</strong> &ndash; Type 3 CPAMs comprise 5 to 10 percent of CPAMs. They are often very large, and can involve an entire lobe or several lobes. They have an acinar origin and consist of adenomatoid proliferation of distal airways or airspaces. They can be a mixture of cystic and solid tissue or be entirely solid. Because of their large size and lack of differentiation, type 3 CPAMs are thought to originate early in gestation (26 to 28 days). The numerous small cysts are less than 0.5 cm in diameter and are lined with nonciliated cuboidal epithelium. They have a thin fibromuscular layer and increased elastic tissue, similar to type 2 lesions. Mucus-secreting cells and cartilage are absent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Affected infants present in utero or at birth, usually with severe respiratory distress or death in the neonatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This type of CPAM has not been associated with malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 4</strong> &ndash; Type 4 lesions comprise 5 to 10 percent of CPAMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/5,26,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26,30</a>]. The cysts have a maximum diameter of 7 cm and consist of nonciliated, flattened, alveolar lining cells, with no mucus cells or skeletal muscle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Type 4 CPAMs may present at birth or in childhood, often with tension pneumothorax or infection, but they may also be identified as incidental findings in asymptomatic patients. Importantly, this type of CPAM is strongly associated with malignancy, especially with pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB). (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Association with malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is variable. Many are identified by routine prenatal ultrasound examination. Early reviews indicated that up to two-thirds of infants with prenatally diagnosed CPAM are symptomatic at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. More recent references suggest that only about 25 percent of affected newborns are symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31</a>]. This discrepancy may reflect improvements in prenatal ultrasound technology, such that smaller lesions are now identified, and these tend to be asymptomatic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appearance of CPAMs on prenatal ultrasound ranges from incidental findings of cystic-appearing lesions to massive pulmonary involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/3,7,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,32-34</a>]. Lesions regress and appear to resolve during the course of gestation in about 50 percent of cases as determined by fetal ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], but most of these will still be detectable on postnatal imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Among lesions present at birth, complete spontaneous resolution in the postnatal period has been reported in a small number of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. A retrospective review suggested that peak CPAM size occurred at approximately 25 weeks gestational age and that regression in size led to favorable outcomes unless severe hydrops was present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Prenatal diagnosis, course, and management of CPAM are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal diagnosis and management of congenital pulmonary airway malformation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116169333\"><span class=\"h3\">Prenatal imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CPAM is one of the most common lung lesions diagnosed prenatally, although the birth prevalence is quite low. Prenatal diagnosis is typically made by ultrasonography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55315%7EPEDS%2F63885\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55315 graphicRef63885 \">image 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81883\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81883 \">image 2</a>). CPAMs presenting prenatally are classified by their ultrasound findings and gross anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Microcystic lesions consist of cysts &lt;5 mm in diameter and appear echogenic and solid, while macrocystic lesions contain one or more cysts &gt;5 mm in diameter. The CPAM volume ratio (CVR) is an index of CPAM volume referenced to the fetal head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55315%7EPEDS%2F63885\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55315 graphicRef63885 \">image 1A-B</a>), and is a useful prognostic indicator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/2,37,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,37,42</a>].

In patients with such anomalies, a fetal karyotype should be obtained. Isolated CPAMs typically are not associated with chromosomal abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-pulmonary-airway-malformation#H5019499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal diagnosis and management of congenital pulmonary airway malformation&quot;, section on 'Assessment for associated anomalies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Development of hydrops</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal hydrops develops in 5 to 40 percent of cases, due to hemodynamic alterations from vena cava obstruction and cardiac displacement and compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/2,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,42</a>]. The risk of hydrops is highest in fetuses with large lesions, lesions that persist into the third trimester, and microcystic lesions. In particular, the CPAM volume ratio (CVR), which is a measure of CPAM volume referenced to the fetal head, predicts an increased risk of hydrops.

It is clear that some of these infants will develop complications (primarily infection) during the first few years of life, but the frequency varies markedly among different case series. The risk of malignancy is extremely low except in type 4 CPAMs, although type 1 lesions may also have some malignant potential. The uncertainty about the risk of infection and malignancy is the basis for controversy about how to manage these patients, as discussed below.

As an example, in a series of 89 infants with prenatally diagnosed CPAM, 22 had abnormal breathing, including 12 with severe respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The likelihood of respiratory distress, and its severity, increases with the size of the lesion (eg, CVR &gt;0.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Other sonographic predictors of respiratory distress at birth include mediastinal shift, polyhydramnios, and ascites. </p><p>Some clinical features are associated with CPAM type:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 0 CPAMs are associated with severely impaired gas exchange, and affected infants die at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 CPAMs comprise the majority of CPAMs presenting in newborns. When symptomatic, typical signs include tachypnea, increased respiratory effort with grunting and retractions, and cyanosis. Depending upon the extent of air trapping, large cysts may expand, which leads to respiratory distress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 CPAMs are often diagnosed soon after birth because of their association with other congenital anomalies, which are present in up to 60 percent of affected patients. Presenting respiratory signs and symptoms are similar to those noted with type 1 CPAMs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 3 CPAM is the most severe form (other than type 0, which is uniformly lethal at birth). Type 3 lesions are large and can involve the entire lung, and fetal hydrops and pulmonary hypoplasia are typical. Infants may be stillborn or present immediately after birth with severe, progressive respiratory distress, cyanosis, and respiratory failure. Historically, there has been a strong male predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 4 CPAMs can present in the neonatal period, and may be difficult to distinguish from type 1 lesions.

Radiography does not reliably distinguish among them. However, types 1 and 4 tend to appear as a single lesion, with one or a few large cysts that may be entirely air-filled or have air-fluid levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76692\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76692 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56702\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56702 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In contrast, type 3 CPAM often appears as a large, solid, homogeneous mass. There is usually a marked shift of the mediastinal contents to the contralateral side with hypoplasia of the ipsilateral lung due to mass effect. The presence of pneumothorax, or bilateral or multifocal cysts, strongly suggests CPAM type 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These distinctions are clinically important because type 4 is associated with malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Pleuropulmonary blastoma'</a> below.) </p><p>CT scans of the chest correlate with pathologic findings.

CT accurately identified both small (&lt;2 cm in diameter) and large cysts, and whether they were filled with air <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fluid. Areas of consolidation corresponded to glandular or bronchiolar structures; this was observed in 43 percent of the scans. The area around cystic lesions where attenuation was lower than normal lung represented microcysts blending into normal lung parenchyma; this feature was seen in 29 percent of the CT scans. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of CPAM includes bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS).

In contrast to CPAM, BPS usually has no connection to the tracheobronchial tree and is supplied by an anomalous systemic artery, rather than the pulmonary circulation. The systemic arterial supply can be demonstrated by color flow Doppler. However, hybrid lesions with histologic characteristics of CPAM and a systemic arterial supply have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In a series of 50 patients with BPS, 50 percent of the cases were associated with CPAMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Resection is frequently required in newborns with significant respiratory distress, but it is often done electively in older children who present with less acute symptoms. In older children, resection is usually performed to prevent recurrent infection and to eliminate concerns regarding malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Pleuropulmonary blastoma'</a> below.)</p><p>The surgery is curative and has few complications. Lobectomy is generally preferred to wedge resection because of the technical difficulty in identifying planes of dissection with some lesions and the increased morbidity associated with partial resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/2,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,60</a>].

For infants and children who remain completely asymptomatic, the decision between surgical management and observation is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. </p><p>The main rationale for surgery is that it eliminates the risks of future infection and the potential for malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/2,63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,63-65</a>]. However, the magnitude of these risks is poorly established. The estimated frequency of infection developing in an infant who is asymptomatic at birth and does not undergo surgery is probably about 5 to 10 percent, as discussed below (see <a href=\"#H1151155570\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> below). In addition, there are fewer postoperative complications in patients undergoing elective surgery compared with those undergoing surgery after infectious symptoms develop (10 percent versus 32 percent in one metaanalysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The risk of malignancy is extremely low except in type 4 CPAMs, although type 1 lesions may also have some malignant potential (see <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Association with malignancy'</a> below). A secondary consideration is that early surgery may have advantages for compensatory lung growth. This possibility is supported by observations of normal pulmonary function in most children who had surgery for CPAM during the neonatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/2,67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,67-69</a>], although a few reports reach different conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/9,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,70</a>]. </p><p>The main rationale in favor of observation is that surgery may be entirely avoided for some patients. The drawbacks of the observation strategy are the risk of infection developing within the cysts, the low but present risk of malignant transformation, and radiation exposure. Proponents of this approach cite the relatively low rate of infection (5 to 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], and point out that only one case has been reported of pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) arising in an asymptomatic antenatally diagnosed CPAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Nonetheless, they acknowledge that surgery should be considered for infants with high-risk features (see <a href=\"#H1568822012\" class=\"local\">'High risk'</a> below). In some reports, spontaneous regression has been reported in up to 20 percent of asymptomatic infants with congenital cystic lesions confirmed by computerized tomography (CT) scan in the neonatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/37,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,72</a>].

We choose among these options after a detailed discussion with the family about the relative advantages and disadvantages of each approach. In particular, the family should understand that children who do not undergo surgery have a risk of developing infection in the cyst, and that outcomes of surgery are generally excellent. (See <a href=\"#H1151155570\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below.)</p><p>If surgical resection is chosen for an asymptomatic low-risk patient, it is usually performed after the neonatal period and before 12 months of age, but the optimal timing has not been established, and practice varies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

In patients with CPAM, BAC is usually discovered incidentally in cysts resected during adolescence or adulthood (range 6 months to 75 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It has been estimated that BAC eventually develops in approximately 1 percent of unresected CPAM type 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>], but the true rate of this malignancy and its clinical significance remains unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among CPAM diagnosed prenatally, the overall survival rate is more than 95 percent, and the presence of fetal hydrops is an important predictor of mortality. For most symptomatic or asymptomatic infants with CPAM, surgical excision in the neonatal period is curative and the prognosis is excellent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/2,86,99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,86,99,100</a>]. The remaining lung parenchyma undergoes compensatory growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>], and pulmonary function is generally normal in long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/2,68,102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,68,102,103</a>]. </p><p>The good overall prognosis described above reflects the predominance of the type 1 lesion. The prognosis for type 2 and 3 CPAMs is not as favorable, although recovery is possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/7,9,10,104-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,10,104-106</a>]. Outcomes in infants with type 2 lesions may be influenced by the severity of the accompanying congenital anomalies. Infants with type 3 lesions frequently have severe hypoplasia of the contralateral lung and are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>]. </p><p>The outcome of type 4 CPAM is also quite good with surgical resection. However, because this lesion probably represents cystic pleuropulmonary blastoma, oncologic consultation and complete surgical resection is essential. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Pleuropulmonary blastoma'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), previously known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM), is a developmental anomaly of the respiratory tract. CPAMs are categorized as types 0 through 4, which are defined pathologically and have different clinical presentations and prognoses. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Types'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type 1 CPAMs comprise approximately 70 percent of all CPAMs. Large cysts may be detected on prenatal ultrasound and may cause respiratory distress in the neonate. Smaller cysts may present months or years later as incidental findings on imaging studies or as a focus of recurrent pulmonary infection. Type 1 CPAMs are associated with a slight risk of malignancy. Care must be taken not to misclassify type 4 lesions as type 1, because type 4 lesions have a high malignant potential. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Types'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type 4 CPAMs comprise 5 to 10 percent of all CPAMs. Many of these lesions are cystic forms of pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), so identification and resection of these lesions is essential. Important clues that suggest this type of CPAM are presentation with pneumothorax, the presence of bilateral or multifocal lung cysts, or a family history of lung cysts or PPB-associated conditions (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Types'</a> above and <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Pleuropulmonary blastoma'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All infants with a prenatal diagnosis of CPAM should have a chest radiograph in the neonatal period, even if they are asymptomatic and even if the lesion appeared to resolve on serial prenatal ultrasounds. In addition, all infants should have computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The timing of the imaging depends on symptoms and on the results of the initial chest radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102532\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102532 \">algorithm 1</a>). CT or MRI should be performed even in infants with normal chest radiographs because plain radiographs often fail to detect CPAM in asymptomatic neonates. (See <a href=\"#H116169897\" class=\"local\">'Suggested protocol'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with CPAM that is causing any respiratory symptoms (respiratory distress or tachypnea), we recommend surgical resection rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102532\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102532 \">algorithm 1</a>). All resected cysts should be carefully examined for evidence of malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H107006232\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic infants with a prenatal diagnosis of CPAM should be evaluated with a chest radiograph in the neonatal period. Subsequent management depends on whether there are characteristics that suggest a high risk of complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102532\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102532 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For infants and children with high-risk characteristics (large lesions on chest radiograph, bilateral or multifocal cysts, a family history of pleuropulmonary blastoma-associated conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102602\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102602 \">table 1</a>), or pneumothorax), we suggest early surgical resection rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). These infants should be evaluated with CT or MRI prior to surgery to confirm the diagnosis and further evaluate the lesion. (See <a href=\"#H1568822012\" class=\"local\">'High risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For infants and children with small lesions and none of the other high-risk features outlined above, either elective surgical resection or conservative management with observation are reasonable options. If surgical resection is chosen for such patients, it is usually performed after the neonatal period but before 12 months of age. If observation is chosen, we suggest close clinical follow-up during the first year of life to monitor for the development of symptoms of respiratory distress or infection, as well as imaging with CT or MRI by six months of age and annually thereafter. (See <a href=\"#H1568822018\" class=\"local\">'Low risk'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants who are asymptomatic at birth, the risk of developing infection is not well delineated. It is clear that some of these infants will develop infection during the first few years of life if surgery is not performed, but the estimates of the risk for infection ranges from 3 to 30 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1151155570\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the majority of infants with CPAM, surgical excision in the neonatal period is curative and the prognosis excellent.
