(See <a href=\"#H13239723\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>A key difference in the clinical presentation of ACS between children and adults with SCD is the greater disease severity and a higher mortality rate in adults, largely due to a higher incidence of bone marrow and fat emboli in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In adults with SCD, up to 77 percent of ACS episodes are the result of bone marrow or fat emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; in children, the proportion is much lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>].</p><p>The differing etiologies and clinical course of ACS episodes underscore the notion that the definition of ACS (a new radiodensity on chest radiograph with respiratory symptoms) captures a <strong>non-specific clinical endpoint</strong> that includes different underlying pathogenic processes. As examples, the broad definition of ACS does not differentiate between a patient with SCD who presents with fever, increased respiratory effort, and a new radiodensity due to bronchiolitis requiring a brief inpatient admission (a more common scenario in children) from ACS with intra-pulmonary vaso-occlusion and respiratory failure due to fat emboli requiring management in the intensive care unit (a more common scenario in adults). </p><p>Although the management of ACS episodes is largely the same in adults and children with SCD, the higher rate of severe ACS episodes in adults should prompt a lower threshold for the use of red blood cell transfusion therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955287\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), the largest natural history study of SCD that includes both adults and children, approximately 50 percent of patients with SCD will have an episode of acute chest syndrome (ACS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The rate of death per ACS episode is 4.3 percent in adults with SCD compared with a rate of 1.1 percent in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955301\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two large cohort studies (National Acute Chest Syndrome Study Group [NACSSG] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and CSSCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]) have best defined the clinical presentation and outcomes of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in adults and children with sickle cell disease (SCD), although the majority of subjects in both cohorts consisted of children.</p><p>The NACSSG examined a cohort of 538 adults and children with SCD and 671 episodes of ACS in order to evaluate causes and outcomes of ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Significant differences in etiology and clinical course of ACS were found when adults &ge;20 years were compared with children zero to 19 years: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults were more likely to present with complaints of chest pain (55 versus 41 percent), pain in the arms and legs (59 versus 30 percent), rib and sternal pain (30 versus 18 percent), and shortness of breath (58 versus 36 percent) than were children. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodes of ACS in adults were more likely to be complicating vaso-occlusive pain episodes compared with children with SCD (82 versus 58 percent); adults commonly had neurological findings during these ACS events (22 versus 8 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course of adults versus children with ACS was also very different. Adults were more likely to require mechanical ventilation (22 versus 10 percent), have a prolonged hospital stay (13 versus 10 days), and have a greater risk of death (9 versus 1 percent) compared with children.</p><p/><p>Data from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSCCD) examined 939 children and adults with SCD who had 1722 episodes of ACS and found that adults with SCD were more likely than children to present with chest pain (84 versus 41 percent) and shortness of breath (47 versus 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The radiographic findings also differed by age, as adults were more likely than children to have multilobe involvement of infiltrates (36 versus 24 percent). Additionally, adults were more likely to have pain preceding the ACS event (50 versus 11 percent) whereas children were more likely to have fever (64 versus 85 percent).</p><p>Taken together, the findings from these two studies show that ACS episodes in adults with SCD are often preceded by a vaso-occlusive pain episode, present with chest, arm, and leg pain consistent with a pain crisis, and follow a much more severe clinical course, often requiring mechanical ventilation, and sometimes resulting in death. These data also underscore the importance of applying evidence generated from adults as opposed to children with SCD when making treatment decisions about ACS in an adult.</p><p>Up to one-fifth of adults with a history of ACS can develop a rapidly progressive ACS syndrome characterized by respiratory failure and multiorgan failure.

Despite the challenging diagnosis of fat emboli as the initiating cause of ACS, significant evidence including laboratory findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], post-mortem evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], imaging of the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and bone marrow biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] support this unique diagnosis. However, since testing for fat emboli requires bronchoscopy and is not performed routinely, the true incidence of fat emboli in patients with ACS is not known.</p><p>Bone marrow aspiration showing bone marrow necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>] and bone marrow imaging showing recent bone marrow infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] provided preliminary evidence for a causative role of fat emboli in ACS. Two studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17</a>] and a follow-up study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] significantly added to this evidence by performing bronchoalveolar lavage during ACS episodes and demonstrating the presence of fat in alveolar macrophages.</p><p>In a study of 20 adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and ACS, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed to examine for the presence of fat-containing alveolar macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Using a cut-off of &gt;5 percent fat-containing alveolar macrophages, 60 percent of ACS cases in adults with SCD were associated with fat emboli. Furthermore, 92 percent of the cases demonstrating fat-containing alveolar macrophages showed some evidence of bone marrow infarction on MRI or radioisotopic bone imaging.</p><p>A follow-up study of adults with SCD evaluated whether induced sputum could reliably detect fat-containing alveolar macrophages when compared with bronchoalveolar lavage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A significant correlation was found between induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage for detecting fat-containing macrophages. Similar to prior studies, adults with evidence of fat emboli were more likely to have signs and symptoms consistent with bone marrow infarction, including pain, neurological symptoms, and a lower platelet count.</p><p>Lipemia retinalis and petechiae are not commonly seen in fat emboli in SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]; if observed, however, these findings would be consistent with the clinical syndrome of fat emboli. ACS etiologies other than vaso-occlusion may also be associated with bone marrow necrosis and fat emboli, such as parvovirus B19 infection, and may also be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Twenty-seven children with SCD versus 43 controls underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage to determine whether pulmonary fat emboli could also be detected in the lungs of children with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among the 27 children with SCD, 12 (44 percent) demonstrated evidence of pulmonary macrophages with intracellular fat while no control subject had pulmonary fat emboli. Consistent with the hypothesis that the pulmonary fat emboli are generated during a vaso-occlusive crisis and contribute to a unique clinical presentation, all of the SCD subjects with pulmonary fat emboli presented with pain, 11 of 12 reported chest pain, and 6 of 12 had neurological symptoms. In comparison, only 6 of 15 patients who were negative for pulmonary fat emboli had pain or chest pain and no subject displayed neurological findings. The patients with pulmonary fat emboli were more likely to have more lung segments involved with infiltrate, have lower oxygen saturation, develop respiratory distress, and have a longer hospital stay. </p><p>Laboratory findings in patients with pulmonary fat emboli on bronchoscopy compared with those without this finding, showed lower hemoglobin levels, lower platelet counts, and increased numbers of circulating nucleated red blood cells. These latter laboratory tests reflect the presence of bone marrow necrosis underlying the generation of bone marrow and fat emboli.

Etiologies for ACS either trigger vaso-occlusion (eg, infection, asthma, hypoventilation) or are a result of vaso-occlusion (eg, bone marrow and fat emboli) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23</a>]. These etiologies can occur together; once intra-pulmonary vaso-occlusion is initiated, it is propagated by hypoxia, inflammation, and acidosis.</p><p>Bone marrow ischemia and necrosis, characteristic of SCD vaso-occlusive episodes, cause the release of bone marrow and fat into the venous circulation where they primarily affect the lungs and the central nervous system by mechanically obstructing the vasculature and promoting a pro-inflammatory state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Inflammation associated with fat emboli is likely due to the presence of free fatty acids converted from neutral fat by secretory phospholipase A2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Free fatty acids are highly pro-inflammatory and more likely to cause tissue injury than neutral fats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Hypoxemia and inflammation associated with bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fat embolism promote further vaso-occlusion, creating a vicious cycle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13239555\"><span class=\"h3\">Association with the multi-organ failure syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow necrosis with attendant bone marrow and fat emboli is also thought to contribute to the etiology of acute multi-organ failure syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,25</a>]. There is significant overlap between the clinical presentation of severe ACS episodes due to fat emboli in adults with SCD and multi-organ failure syndrome. </p><p>Acute multi-organ failure syndrome is characterized by acute dysfunction of the lung, liver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> kidney (dysfunction of at least two of these three organs are required to meet the definition) occurring during a vaso-occlusive pain episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Fever, confusion, decreased hemoglobin levels and decreased platelet counts are also frequently present during acute multi-organ failure syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Since episodes of ACS associated with fat emboli are often characterized by infiltrates, hypoxia, confusion, and thrombocytopenia occurring during a painful vaso-occlusive episode, these ACS events likely represent the same underlying etiology of acute multi-system organ failure syndrome (bone marrow and fat emboli), with the predominant organ affected being the lung.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13239577\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection and asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection and asthma, common causes of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD), also occur in adults, albeit with a lower incidence rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5,7,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,26,27</a>].

If the presence of hypoxemia is critical to the management of the patient with SCD, an arterial blood gas is required to directly measure oxygen pressure and saturation by co-oximetry.</p><p>We recommend the delivery of oxygen when oxygen saturation (Sa0<sub>2</sub>) is &lt;92 percent or oxygen pressure (PaO<sub>2</sub>) is &lt;70 mmHg. Oxygen saturation levels &lt;92 percent calculated from pulse oximetry should be further evaluated with an arterial blood gas sample. If the patient is known to have a steady state oxygen saturation &lt;92 percent, a comparison to the baseline value may be helpful. In this case, decreases of &ge;3 percent should be evaluated with an arterial blood gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17232285\"><span class=\"h3\">VTE prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACS is an acute medical illness that predisposes patients to venous thromboembolic (VTE) events. All adult patients with ACS should receive VTE prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>. Our preference is to administer a once daily prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux. In contrast, we do not use routine thromboprophylaxis for VTE in hospitalized children with SCD (ie, those less than 21 years). This is discussed in more detail separately.

We perform exchange transfusions either manually or via erythrocytapheresis every four to six weeks to maintain a hemoglobin S percentage &lt;50 percent. Of note, this is a less stringent percentage than that used to treat acute events. Chronic transfusion therapy is continued for one to two years.
