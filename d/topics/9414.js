The term &quot;iodine deficiency disorders&quot; refers to all of the consequences of iodine deficiency, which depend on its severity and the age of the affected subject [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When severe iodine deficiency occurs during pregnancy, it is associated with fetal hypothyroidism, mental impairment, and increased neonatal and infant mortality. In adults, iodine-induced hypothyroidism is rare, while the most common manifestation is goiter that progresses to nodular goiter and eventually to thyroid autonomy and hyperthyroidism.</p><p>Iodine is an essential component of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), and it must be provided in the diet. Inadequate iodine intake leads to inadequate thyroid hormone production, and all the consequences of iodine deficiency stem from the associated hypothyroidism.</p><p>In developing countries, iodine deficiency has been identified as one of the modifiable factors that have an adverse effect on child development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is a global public health problem and, in combating it, emphasis should be placed on diagnosis and correction at the level of the community rather than the individual. The Iodine Global Network maintains a website (<a href=\"http://www.ign.org/index.cfm&amp;token=/X4g7+sewxmWp4CuQuIf4gkpRRKY6+Ojpb8L1MiLBkBq2W1W29WqWz5uTxRMLGtc&amp;TOPIC_ID=7828\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Iodine Global Network</a>) with databases of information about iodine nutrition in different countries and an information reference desk.</p><p>This topic will review the consequences of iodine deficiency, its geographical distribution, diagnostic measures, prophylaxis, and treatment. Other aspects of iodine and the thyroid, including the adverse consequences of iodine excess, are discussed separately.

In order for the thyroid gland to synthesize adequate amounts of T4, approximately 52 mcg of iodide must be taken up daily by the thyroid gland. Severe iodine deficiency develops when iodide intake is chronically &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-hormone-synthesis-and-physiology#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid hormone synthesis and physiology&quot;, section on 'Thyroid hormone biosynthesis'</a>.)</p><p>Iodine can be obtained by consumption of foods that naturally contain it (fish, seafood, kelp, some drinking water, and vegetables grown in iodine-sufficient soil) or to which it is added (table salt). Cow's milk is a source of iodine owing to iodine in cattle feed and the use of iodophor udder cleansers in the dairy industry. Sea salt naturally contains only a small amount of iodine. Dietary iodine is absorbed as iodide and rapidly distributed in the extracellular fluid, which also contains iodide released from the thyroid and by extrathyroidal deiodination of the iodothyronines. Iodide leaves this pool by transport into the thyroid and excretion into the urine.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>90 mcg of iodine daily for infants and children up to 5 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>120 mcg for children 6 to 12 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>150 mcg daily for children &ge;12 years and adults</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>250 mcg daily during pregnancy and lactation</p><p/><p>The United States Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended minimum daily intake of iodine is similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>90 mcg daily for children 1 to 8 years old</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>120 mcg for children 9 to 13 years old</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>150 mcg daily for older adolescents and nonpregnant adults</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>220 mcg for pregnant women</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>290 mcg for lactating women</p><p/><p>The iodine requirements are higher in pregnant women due to an increase in maternal T4 production required to maintain maternal euthyroidism.

Between 2003 and 2014, the total number of countries with adequate iodine intake increased from 67 to 116 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Although there has been steady progress in many regions (Europe, Asia, Western Pacific), there has been less progress in Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>European countries lacking specific iodine prophylaxis programs are also mildly iodine deficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The prevalence of iodine deficiency in Europe was reduced by 30 percent from 2003 to 2010, but 44 percent of school-age children still have insufficient iodine intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a 2009 survey of schoolgirls aged 14 to 15 years living in the United Kingdom, which has long been considered iodine sufficient, median urinary iodine excretion was 80.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> consistent with mild iodine deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In Italy, urinary iodine excretion was randomly measured in 26,913 individuals, as part of a project to eradicate iodine deficiency disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Urinary iodine was lower than 100 and 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> in 64.3 and 34.9 percent of samples, respectively. Median urinary iodine in nonurban areas was significantly lower than in urban areas (69 versus 79 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span>. There were no differences in urinary iodine excretion among children residing in lowland, coastal mountainous hilly, and mountainous hilly areas.</p><p>Only a few countries appear to have sustainable iodine sufficiency at the present time: the United States, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Bhutan, Peru, Panama, Macedonia, and Japan.</p><p>Iodine intake in the United States has decreased slightly since 2007, with a median urinary iodine excretion of 144 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> (1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Among women of reproductive age, the median urinary iodine excretion was 129 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> with 37 percent of women having levels &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> (consistent with mild iodine deficiency). Iodine nutrition in the United States is mainly achieved by silent iodine prophylaxis, a natural increase in iodine intake because of higher consumption of iodine-rich products (eg, industrially prepared dairy products) associated with socioeconomic development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The decline in iodine intake over the last decade may be related to a reduction in the iodine content of dairy products, removal of iodate dough conditioners in commercially produced bread, and increasing use of noniodized salt by the food industry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSEQUENCES OF IODINE DEFICIENCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diffuse and nodular goiter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Goiter is the most obvious manifestation of iodine deficiency. Low iodine intake leads to reduced T4 and T3 production, which results in increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion in an attempt to restore T4 and T3 production to normal. TSH also stimulates thyroid growth; thus, goiter occurs as part of the compensatory response to iodine deficiency.</p><p>The goiter is initially diffuse but eventually becomes nodular because the cells in some thyroid follicles proliferate more than others, and over time, nodules can enlarge and undergo cystic degeneration, hemorrhage, and calcification. Therefore, in regions of iodine deficiency, children and adolescents generally have diffuse goiters, while adults who lived in conditions of longstanding iodine deficiency have nodular goiter. Iodine deficiency favoring thyroid follicular cell replication also increases the chance of mutations in the TSH receptor gene that may lead to constitutive activation of the receptor and TSH-independent growth and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3758219694\" class=\"local\">'Hyperthyroidism'</a> below). There is also an increased risk of follicular thyroid cancer in endemic goiter regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Goiter has traditionally been assessed by palpation, particularly in field studies. In the last two decades, ultrasonography, which allows precise estimation of thyroid volume, has become the preferred method of assessment. In regions of iodine deficiency, the median thyroid volume at any age is considerably larger than that in regions of iodine sufficiency. For people living in iodine-sufficient regions, thyroid volume measurements standardized for age, sex, and body size are now available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The volume in subjects living in the United States is smaller than that in Europe, many regions of which have a lower iodine intake than in the United States.</p><p>For many individuals, iodine-deficiency goiter is only a cosmetic problem. In some, however, particularly older adults, the goiter may be large enough to cause compression of the trachea or esophagus or delay recognition of coexisting thyroid cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults#H6514262\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of goiter in adults&quot;, section on 'Obstructive symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3758219694\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperthyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iodine deficiency increases the incidence of diffuse and nodular goiter. Over time, autonomous growth and function may ensue, resulting in toxic goiter and hyperthyroidism if iodine deficiency is not extremely severe. In regions of mild to moderate iodine deficiency, toxic multinodular goiter is a common cause of hyperthyroidism in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Hyperthyroidism is more likely to develop if iodine intake is supplemented, just as it can occur in patients with nontoxic nodular goiters living in iodine-replete regions who are given large doses of iodine.

Adults have the typical clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism and usually a goiter.

For the developing fetus or infant, untreated maternal hypothyroidism due to severe iodine deficiency is a catastrophe because thyroid hormone is essential for normal maturation of the central nervous system, particularly its myelination. For the first 12 weeks of gestation, the fetus is completely dependent upon maternal T4. During the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> week of gestation, fetal TSH appears, and the fetal thyroid is capable of concentrating iodine and synthesizing iodothyronines. However, little hormone synthesis occurs until the 18<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup> week. Thereafter, fetal thyroid secretion increases gradually. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroid disease in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Thyroid function in the fetus'</a>.)</p><p>Hypothyroidism during these critical periods of development and that which continues after the fetal thyroid develops in the setting of ongoing maternal iodine deficiency leads to permanent intellectual disability, which, in its most severe form, is known as cretinism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cretinism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to intellectual disability, cretinism is accompanied by other neurologic and somatic defects. This has led to cretinism being subdivided into neurologic and myxedematous types:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic cretinism is characterized by intellectual disability, deaf mutism, gait disturbances, and spasticity but not hypothyroidism. It is thought to result from hypothyroidism in the mother during early pregnancy but a euthyroid state postnatally due to adequate iodine intake in the newborn.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myxedematous cretinism is characterized by intellectual disability, short stature, and hypothyroidism. It is thought to result from iodine deficiency and thyroid injury predominantly late in pregnancy and continuing after birth.</p><p/><p>These two syndromes overlap considerably [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and attributing them to specific developmental periods is undoubtedly overly simplistic. Both can be prevented by adequate maternal and infant iodine intake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147486588\"><span class=\"h3\">Neonatal and infant mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe iodine deficiency increases neonatal and infant mortality, an effect that can be reduced by up to 50 percent with correction of severe iodine deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The mechanism of this benefit is not known, but multiple factors are probably involved.

For assessing the iodine nutritional status of a population, measurements of urinary iodine concentration in randomly collected urine samples have proven to be as useful as measurements of urinary creatinine and iodine and calculation of the iodine:creatinine ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. The results from random samples also correlate well with 24-hour urine collections. As a result, iodine nutrition is often defined by the urinary iodine concentration in randomly collected urine samples. Mild iodine deficiency is defined as a median urinary iodine concentration of 50 to 99 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> moderate deficiency as 20 to 49 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> and severe deficiency as &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74914\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74914 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1497384308\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid size is a sensitive marker for iodine deficiency because goiter, although not the most severe consequence of iodine deficiency, is the most clinically evident. Assessment by palpation is too crude to be anything more than qualitative except in severe deficiency, but ultrasonography is precise, quantifiable, and easily performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal serum TSH screening for hypothyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In regions of iodine deficiency, the frequency of supranormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations (&gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> in blood spots collected as part of neonatal screening programs is higher than in iodine-sufficient areas and roughly correlates with the severity of iodine deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Transient neonatal hypothyroidism is also more frequent. For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has established that the results of neonatal blood TSH screening can be used as convenient indicators for iodine intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Newborn screening'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum thyroglobulin concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum thyroglobulin concentration is a sensitive measure of thyroid activity and hyperplasia. In iodine-deficient infants and children, serum thyroglobulin concentrations are high more often than are serum TSH concentrations. Although a nonspecific test (since any type of thyroid stimulation or injury raises the serum thyroglobulin concentration), the values correlate well with the severity of iodine deficiency. Thyroglobulin has also been shown to be a sensitive measure of excess iodine intake in school-age children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In one study, the serum thyroglobulin level was better than thyroid volume measurement by ultrasound as an indicator of iodine nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, measurement of thyroglobulin requires blood sampling, which is not easily performed in routine surveys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid radioiodine uptake is increased in iodine deficiency because of both thyroid stimulation and the low iodine pool size, but it is not a practical field test. Serum T4, T3, and TSH concentrations are within their respective normal ranges in most children and adults with iodine deficiency; thus, these tests are not sufficiently sensitive for diagnosis of the disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3266787907\"><span class=\"h2\">Community</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iodine deficiency is a global public health problem and, in combating it, emphasis should be placed on diagnosis and correction at the level of the community rather than the individual. Achieving sufficient iodine nutrition in the population would eliminate the need for specific supplementation during pregnancy and lactation. (See <a href=\"#H59356473\" class=\"local\">'During pregnancy and lactation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59356759\"><span class=\"h3\">Iodization of salt</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iodization of salt is the preferred method of increasing iodine intake in a community. Salt iodination is legally mandated in many countries. Salt is a dietary necessity and often the only one that communities cannot provide for themselves. Adding iodine during the packaging or processing of salt is an efficient means for distributing iodine on a mass basis. It is technically easy (and can even be done manually), and the cost is low, although the accompanying changes in salt processing may increase the price to the consumer. The usual &quot;dose&quot; is between 10 and 50 mg of <span class=\"nowrap\">iodine/kg</span> salt (sodium chloride) as potassium iodide or iodate.</p><p>The optimal amount to be added for a particular country or region can be calculated from the daily per capita salt consumption, the amount of iodine consumed from other sources, and any losses of iodine between production and consumption. Potassium iodide is added in the United States, Canada, and many countries in Western Europe. However, in hot tropical climates or suboptimal conditions of purity or storage, potassium iodate is preferred over potassium iodide because it is more stable. In Finland, iodization of animal feed resulted in a five- to sevenfold increase in the average individual's iodine intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The success of salt iodization programs relates to sources of salt within a country. Some countries, such as Congo, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe, import all their salt, making control of iodization fairly simple. In other countries with numerous scattered salt deposits and a complex distribution system, implementation of salt iodization has been more difficult. A determined international effort towards eliminating iodine deficiency by the year 2005 has resulted in major progress, with approximately 70 percent of households worldwide using adequately iodized salt. In Denmark, the use of iodized salt resulted in a 6 and 14 percent reduction in thyroid gland volume in individuals from areas of mild or moderate iodine deficiency, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59356766\"><span class=\"h3\">Other options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternatives are needed when salt iodization is impractical or delayed. Effective options are iodized oil (Lipiodol), iodized water, and iodine tablets or drops. Water is an occasional iodization vehicle because it is a daily necessity like salt. The technology can be as simple as adding a few drops of iodine to standing drinking water. Addition of molecular iodine (but not iodide or iodate) carries the additional benefit of sterilizing the water.</p><p>In addition, alternative methods of food iodine enrichment are currently under study. Hydroponic experiments were carried out to investigate the possibility of enriching the iodine uptake by spinach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] or other vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes. In one study, biofortification of vegetables with iodine increased urinary iodine concentration and, together with the habitual use of iodized salt, improved the iodine nutritional status of the study participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2014026286\"><span class=\"h2\">Individual</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Correction of iodine deficiency at the level of the community rather than the individual is preferred. Methods of iodide administration for the individual include oral administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-iodide-sski-thyroshield-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium iodide solution</a> every two to four weeks and daily administration of tablets containing from 100 to 300 mcg potassium iodide. The latter is particularly recommended to meet the increased needs for iodine during pregnancy and lactation, and it can be routinely incorporated into prenatal <span class=\"nowrap\">vitamin/mineral</span> preparations. (See <a href=\"#H59356473\" class=\"local\">'During pregnancy and lactation'</a> below.)</p><p>Lipiodol, developed as a radiographic contrast agent, contains 480 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">iodine/mL</span>. A single oral dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mL provides an adequate amount of iodine for six months to one year; intramuscular administration of the same dose provides an adequate amount for two to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Iodized oil is more expensive than salt iodization and requires direct administration to each person. If given intramuscularly, it requires skilled administration and has a risk of infection if improper technique is used. Its main advantage is that it can be implemented promptly. It has been especially valuable for women of childbearing age and children in regions of severe iodine deficiency, such as Africa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362471345\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonpregnant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the general, nonpregnant, nonlactating population in the United States and other iodine-sufficient countries (<a href=\"http://www.ign.org/cm_data/IGN_Global_Map_AllPop_30May2017.pdf&amp;token=/X4g7+sewxmWp4CuQuIf4q5hhtfZa3kd7CYu40T+o7g7V3DYzAWtUE/MOQe47H94OqVOaZbIf+qq0L1YrrdoIJcI34gC2pNp+lKCrSzmFJk=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7828\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">global iodine nutrition map</a>), iodine supplementation above what is obtained from iodine-fortified foods (eg, iodized salt) is not necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59356473\"><span class=\"h3\">During pregnancy and lactation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consuming an adequate amount of iodine during pregnancy is important for fetal development.

Iodine deficiency has recurred in some countries with initially successful programs after a regular follow-up program was abandoned. Potential contributing factors include a decrease in salt intake, a reduction in the use of iodine salts in the baking industry, and undoubtedly other unidentified commercial and environmental factors. In some countries that have mandatory programs of salt iodization, inadequate quality control has caused major fluctuations in dietary iodine intake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59356843\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iodine repletion in the doses used for iodization of salt and in prenatal supplements has few adverse effects. Iodine administration may result in clinically significant hyperthyroidism in patients with endemic goiter or in patients with nodular goiters containing autonomously functioning tissue. This can be potentially very serious in older patients or in those with cardiovascular disease. In contrast, iodine administration may induce or exacerbate hypothyroidism in patients with underlying autoimmune thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In regions of iodine deficiency, both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism have been reported after the introduction of iodine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. However, the benefits of correcting iodine deficiency outweigh the risks of iodization of salt. Iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction is reviewed in more separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-induced-thyroid-dysfunction#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-induced-thyroid-dysfunction#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Iodide-induced hypothyroidism'</a>.)</p><p>Excessive iodine ingestion during pregnancy may also have adverse effects on fetal thyroid function. Sudden exposure to excess serum iodide inhibits organification of iodide, thereby diminishing hormone biosynthesis; this phenomenon is called the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. The fetal thyroid gland is particularly susceptible to the inhibitory effects of excess iodine during the third trimester, which can result in a prolonged inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis, an increase in TSH, and fetal goiter.</p><p>The tolerable upper intake amount for iodine, as established by European and United States expert committees, ranges from 600 to 1100 mcg daily for adults and pregnant women &gt;19 years age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-deficiency-disorders/abstract/4,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,67</a>].

Pregnant women need special attention because their renal threshold for iodine is lower, the needs of the fetus are greater, and dietary salt (including iodized salt) is often restricted.
