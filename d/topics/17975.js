It can also be associated with autoimmune or lymphoproliferative disorders or, rarely, can be idiopathic. Typically, it follows a chronic, smoldering course. Infrequently, mixed cryoglobulinemia may present with a rapidly progressive or even life-threatening course. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cryoglobulins and cryoglobulinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The main indication for immunosuppressive therapy is progressive systemic disease affecting the kidneys, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, skin, or digits.

An overview of cryoglobulinemia and a discussion of the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome are provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cryoglobulins and cryoglobulinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH TO THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the discovery of the association with hepatitis C virus (HCV), both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and cytotoxic drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>) were often used in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia. However, except in those patients with a rapidly progressive course, there was no clear evidence that these modalities were beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> has been gradually replacing cytotoxic drug therapy in such patients.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> is significantly more expensive than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and there are no data directly comparing rituximab with cyclophosphamide in these patients. Thus, cyclophosphamide should still be considered a therapeutic option in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia, especially in life-threatening situations. </p><p>The general approach to therapy in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome includes two broad principles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial immunosuppressive therapy &ndash; Immunosuppression is provided as initial therapy in those patients identified as having a rapidly progressive, organ-threatening, or life-threatening course, regardless of the etiology of the mixed cryoglobulinemia. Immunosuppressive therapy usually combines a short course of glucocorticoids with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and, in some patients, plasmapheresis. (See <a href=\"#H17909481\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressive therapy for severe mixed cryoglobulinemia'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of the underlying disease &ndash; All patients should receive therapy directed against the underlying etiology of the mixed cryoglobulinemia. As examples, patients with HCV who have chronic hepatitis should receive antiviral therapy, while patients with an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder should receive appropriate disease-specific therapy. In some cases, this will involve continuation of immunosuppression for a prolonged period. (See <a href=\"#H17909507\" class=\"local\">'Treat the underlying disorder in all patients'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17909481\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY FOR SEVERE MIXED CRYOGLOBULINEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia who have a rapidly progressive, organ-threatening, or life-threatening course should receive immunosuppressive therapy including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or, if unavailable, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. After disease stabilization, patients should receive concurrent therapy for the underlying disorder responsible for the cryoglobulinemia (eg, antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus [HCV] infection). Exceptions to this general principle include mixed cryoglobulinemia due to HIV or HBV infections; in such patients, antiviral therapy should always be initiated before or at the same time as immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H17909507\" class=\"local\">'Treat the underlying disorder in all patients'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17909544\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome who have one or more of the following manifestations, we suggest immunosuppressive therapy to rapidly improve or resolve target-organ damage, rather than therapy directed at the underlying etiology alone:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glomerulonephritis associated with either a rapidly progressive course <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nephrotic range proteinuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe digital ischemia threatening amputation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal vasculitis associated with abdominal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly progressive neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system vasculitis that may present as a stroke or acute cognitive impairment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary vasculitis associated with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or respiratory failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure </p><p/><p>As discussed below in detail, we usually initiate immunosuppressive therapy in patients with severe HCV-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia <strong>prior</strong> to instituting antiviral treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1233455\" class=\"local\">'Initiation of HCV therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Support for immunosuppressive therapy in patients with severe manifestations comes from randomized trials and observational data in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> was combined with disease-specific therapy (usually antiviral therapy in patients with HCV infection). The following examples illustrate the most relevant findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial, 59 patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia and severe manifestations were assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> therapy or other immunosuppressive agents; in the 53 patients whose disease was due to HCV infection, antiviral therapy had either failed or was not indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Clinical improvement was noted at 12 and 24 months in greater than 60 percent of patients receiving rituximab. These data provide the strongest evidence that immunosuppressive therapy is effective in patients with severe disease, including those with HCV-associated cryoglobulinemia. The comparative effects of rituximab versus other immunosuppressive drugs are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H571919\" class=\"local\">'Preference for rituximab'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective cohort study of 93 patients with HCV-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia, 55 received antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> alone, and 38 received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> given weekly for one month [four doses]) followed one month later by pegylated interferon and ribavirin; median follow-up was 48 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At baseline, 81 percent of patients had neurologic involvement, 33 percent had kidney involvement, and 9 percent had gastrointestinal involvement. Compared with patients who received antiviral therapy alone, patients who received combined therapy with antiviral drugs plus rituximab had a similar rate of response despite having more severe manifestations at baseline, including renal involvement (55 versus 18 percent [estimated glomerular filtration rate, abbreviated as eGFR, 43 versus 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>]). The rate of a complete clinical response (defined as an improvement in all baseline clinical features) in patients receiving combination therapy as compared with antiviral therapy alone was 74 versus 73 percent, but the time until clinical response was significantly shorter with combination therapy (5.4 versus 8.4 months). In addition, combination therapy was associated with a significantly larger improvement in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a significantly larger decline in proteinuria, and a significantly greater likelihood of achieving a complete renal response (81 versus 40 percent). The relapse rate was similar among the treatment groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study evaluated the response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in 87 patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia (80 [92 percent] of whom had HCV infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Approximately half of the patients had previously received antiviral therapy. Rituximab was given for the following indications: glomerulonephritis (30 percent), peripheral neuropathy (23 percent), severe cutaneous vasculitis (25 percent), and multiple manifestations (14 percent). The dose of rituximab varied, with 68 percent receiving four weekly infusions (375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and 21 percent receiving two doses of 1000 mg separated by a two-week interval. At six months, a complete resolution of peripheral neuropathy occurred in 44 percent of patients, and complete healing of cutaneous ulcers occurred in 87 percent of patients. Glomerulonephritis improved in 95 percent of patients, with complete remission in 50 percent marked by normalization of serum creatinine and proteinuria. </p><p/><p>The downstream autoimmune effects of HCV infection provide biological rationale for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> therapy in patients whose disease is triggered by HCV infection. Specifically, chronic HCV infection is associated with polyclonal, oligoclonal, or monoclonal B lymphocyte expansion that can result in the production of autoreactive antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. This autoimmune process can persist and produce disease manifestations even after effective antiviral therapy and complete suppression of viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>The magnitude of the benefit from aggressive therapy in patients with severe disease is related to the phase of illness. As an example, if polyneuropathy is already advanced when therapy is initiated, the benefit is less impressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> also appears to provide effective therapy in patients with the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome <strong>not</strong> associated with chronic HCV infection. In the French multicenter CryoVas survey, for example, 242 patients were identified who were HCV, HBV, and HIV negative and who had mixed cryoglobulinemia and vasculitis; 30 percent had an underlying rheumatologic disorder, 22 percent had a lymphoproliferative disorder, and the remainder had idiopathic mixed cryoglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In adjusted analyses, combination therapy with rituximab and glucocorticoids was associated with a nearly fourfold higher rate of achieving a complete clinical response as compared with glucocorticoid therapy alone. In contrast, the combination of alkylating agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>) with glucocorticoids was not significantly associated with a better clinical response than glucocorticoids alone. However, severe infections were more common with rituximab, especially in elderly patients with renal failure in whom high-dose glucocorticoids were also used, and mortality was similar regardless of the treatment used. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17909552\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of immunosuppressive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients selected for initial immunosuppressive therapy, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> rather than other immunosuppressive drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or glucocorticoids alone. In addition, we suggest pulse glucocorticoid therapy followed by a rapid taper in most patients rather than prolonged glucocorticoid therapy or no glucocorticoid therapy. In those patients with life-threatening disease or cryoglobulinemia-associated hyperviscosity syndrome, we also suggest plasmapheresis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia&quot;, section on 'Emergency management of hyperviscosity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rationale for these suggestions and the regimens used are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H571927\" class=\"local\">'Rituximab regimen'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1233191\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>However, there are settings in which we would <strong>not</strong> use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to treat mixed cryoglobulinemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with HIV infection who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) or if, in those patients receiving ART, the viral load is not suppressed. Such patients are at high risk for enhanced viral replication as a result of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with HBV infection who are not receiving antiviral therapy or have chronic active hepatitis. The preferred antiviral regimens are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Anti-HBV therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>These suggestions for immunosuppressive therapy, particularly the suggestion that glucocorticoids be tapered rapidly, apply to most treated patients since the great majority of such patients will have mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome due to a chronic viral infection (mainly HCV infection). However, some patients may require alternate immunosuppressive regimens tailored to treat the underlying cause, such as autoimmune diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) and lymphoproliferative disorders. This is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H6575895\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune disorders'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6575986\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoma'</a> below and <a href=\"#H571879\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic disease'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H571919\"><span class=\"h3\">Preference for rituximab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two open-label randomized trials suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> is effective in patients with severe mixed cryoglobulinemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter trial assigned 59 patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia (93 percent with HCV infection) and severe manifestations (defined as the presence of skin ulcerations, active glomerulonephritis, or progressive peripheral neuropathy) to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> therapy (1000 mg intravenous infusion at baseline and at day 14) or conventional immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Conventional immunosuppressive therapy varied according to the treating physician; of 29 patients assigned to conventional therapy, 17 received glucocorticoids alone, 5 received plasmapheresis, 4 received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and 3 received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>. The primary endpoint was success of the initial therapy through 12 months; failure of treatment was due either to a lack of clinical improvement or side effects requiring that the therapy be altered. Significantly more patients receiving rituximab therapy had treatment success at 12 months (64 versus 4 percent) and at 24 months (61 versus 4 percent). Of those patients initially receiving conventional therapy who had a treatment failure, 60 percent had a favorable response to rituximab.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single-center trial assigned 24 patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia due to HCV infection to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> therapy (375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> given weekly for one month [four doses]) or to continue their current treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. At baseline, 33 percent had active glomerulonephritis, 50 percent had peripheral neuropathy, and 25 percent had cutaneous ulcers. All patients had either failed to achieve a clinical response with antiviral therapy alone or failed to tolerate antiviral therapy. Of the twelve patients assigned to rituximab therapy, six also received glucocorticoids (mean dose of 26 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> per day), one also received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and two also received plasmapheresis. Of the twelve patients assigned to continue their current treatment, three received glucocorticoids (mean dose of 10 mg prednisone per day). At six months, significantly more patients in the rituximab group achieved clinical remission (10 of 12 versus 1 of 12), which was defined as a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score equal to zero. </p><p/><p>These trials showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> therapy was effective in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia and severe manifestations, allowed for reductions in glucocorticoid use, and did not lead to a worsening of hepatitis. However, neither demonstrated that rituximab was superior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> therapy or plasmapheresis. In the first trial, most patients in the control group were receiving glucocorticoid therapy alone (at a mean <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose of 28 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; in the second trial, most patients in the control group received no immunosuppressive therapy, and those who did were treated with prednisone at a low dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia has also been shown in numerous observational studies and case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/16,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19-23</a>]. The following examples illustrate the range of findings in various patient subgroups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cirrhosis &ndash; Most studies of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> have excluded patients with cirrhosis or have included very small numbers of cirrhotics. In a prospective study, 15 patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia and cirrhosis due to HCV infection were treated with rituximab (375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> weekly for four weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The majority of patients had a complete, major, or partial response to rituximab with respect to ulcers, purpura, neuropathic pain, nephritis, or arthralgias. Most patients also had an improvement in the Child-Pugh score, an increase in serum albumin, and a decreased requirement for albumin infusions and diuretics. Of the six patients with ascites, all had an impressive reduction or disappearance of ascites. However, this unblinded study should be interpreted with caution since the diagnosis of ascites and the Child-Pugh score can be subjective. In addition, a full discussion of adverse events was not included. Although these are encouraging, further studies of rituximab in patients with cirrhosis are required before it is used widely in such patients. Thus, the presence of decompensated cirrhosis is a relative contraindication to rituximab therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with glomerulonephritis &ndash; Among 11 patients from two series with mixed cryoglobulinemia and biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis due to HCV infection, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> alone (375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly [four doses] initially followed by two additional doses at months 2 and 3) was associated with improvements in serum creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria in all patients, paralleled by an increase in complement factor 4 (C4) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe polyneuropathy &ndash; Thirteen patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia and polyneuropathy refractory to antiviral therapy and conventional immunosuppressive medications received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly [four doses] initially followed by two additional doses at months 2 and 3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Short-term infusion reactions following rituximab do not appear to be more frequent in mixed cryoglobulinemia than in rheumatoid arthritis.

Support for plasma exchange is also based upon mechanistic grounds since plasma exchange removes circulating cryoglobulins.

It can also be associated with autoimmune or lymphoproliferative disorders and, rarely, can be idiopathic. Typically, it follows a chronic, smoldering course. Infrequently, mixed cryoglobulinemia may present with a rapidly progressive or even life-threatening course. (See <a href=\"#H2351357133\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general approach to therapy in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome includes two broad principles (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General approach to therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial immunosuppressive therapy &ndash; Immunosuppression is provided as initial therapy in those patients identified as having a rapidly progressive, organ-threatening, or life-threatening course, regardless of the etiology of the mixed cryoglobulinemia. Immunosuppressive therapy usually combines a short course of glucocorticoids with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and, in some patients, plasmapheresis. (See <a href=\"#H17909481\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressive therapy for severe mixed cryoglobulinemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of the underlying disease &ndash; All patients should receive therapy directed against the underlying etiology of the mixed cryoglobulinemia. As examples, patients with HCV should receive antiviral therapy, while patients with an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder should receive appropriate disease-specific therapy. In some cases, this will involve continuation of immunosuppression for a prolonged period. (See <a href=\"#H17909507\" class=\"local\">'Treat the underlying disorder in all patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome and severe disease-associated manifestations, we recommend immunosuppressive therapy plus treatment of the underlying etiology, rather than therapy directed at the underlying etiology alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Severe disease-associated manifestations include (see <a href=\"#H17909544\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Glomerulonephritis associated with either a rapidly progressive course <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nephrotic range proteinuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe digital ischemia threatening amputation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastrointestinal vasculitis associated with abdominal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rapidly progressive neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Central nervous system vasculitis that may present as a stroke or acute cognitive impairment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulmonary vasculitis associated with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or respiratory failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heart failure </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe and refractory vasculitic skin ulcers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia due to HIV or HBV infections, antiviral therapy should always be initiated before or at the same time as immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H17909481\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressive therapy for severe mixed cryoglobulinemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients selected for initial immunosuppressive therapy, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> rather than other immunosuppressive drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or glucocorticoids alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In addition, we suggest pulse glucocorticoid therapy followed by a rapid taper in most patients rather than prolonged glucocorticoid therapy or no glucocorticoid therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In those patients with life-threatening disease or cryoglobulinemia-associated hyperviscosity syndrome, we also suggest plasmapheresis in addition to immunosuppressive therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Anti-HBV therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> therapy in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia, particularly in patients with HCV or HBV infection, carries the risk of enhancing viral replication. In patients with organ-threatening or life-threatening disease, cyclophosphamide therapy may be used as an alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> if rituximab therapy is unavailable, fails to produce a clinical response, or is not tolerated. When used, cyclophosphamide can be used in combination with glucocorticoids with or without plasma exchange, similar to rituximab. The cyclophosphamide dose in such patients is 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day orally for two to four months. The initial dose should be adjusted according to the age and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). (See <a href=\"#H1230577\" class=\"local\">'Role of cyclophosphamide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections, such as <em>Pneumocystis pneumonia</em>, should be provided in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Patients should also receive age-appropriate immunizations, ideally several weeks before the initiation of immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"#H1576718960\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following approach to therapy applies to most patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia due to HCV infection (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Therapy for HCV infection'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In general, antiviral therapy should be delayed for one to four months in patients with severe disease who require initial therapy with immunosuppressant agents. (See <a href=\"#H1233455\" class=\"local\">'Initiation of HCV therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The specific antiviral drugs and doses used depend upon the HCV genotype and also upon the renal function. Interferon-free regimens are preferred based upon the data linking cure of HCV to resolution of cryoglobulinemia, as well as the improved safety and efficacy of these regimens. (See <a href=\"#H1233463\" class=\"local\">'Drugs and dosing in HCV therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The duration of antiviral therapy is based upon the HCV genotype, prior treatment response, tolerance to treatment, and the clinical and laboratory response to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H546513\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We generally follow renal and hepatic function weekly during the first two weeks of antiviral therapy, and then monthly thereafter. The frequency of follow-up visits in the clinic depends upon the cryoglobulinemia disease activity, treatment regimen, comorbidities, and tolerance of therapy. Patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension or poor renal function may require more frequent monitoring due to higher risk of side effects. (See <a href=\"#H1233471\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring of patients on antiviral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia due to HBV infection, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> is usually preferred in view of its antiviral efficacy, low propensity for drug resistance, and low risk for nephrotoxicity. Antiviral therapy is usually continued indefinitely. In patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia due to HBV infection who have severe manifestations (eg, glomerulonephritis, cutaneous ulcers, progressive neuropathy), initial immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids can be used. However, antiviral therapy should be initiated <strong>as soon as possible</strong> when immunosuppressive therapy is planned (preferably prior to the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy), regardless of HBe and HBV DNA status. <strong>If addition of </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a><strong> is considered, antiviral therapy is mandatory, and there should be evidence of viral suppression.</strong> Rituximab should not be used in patients with active hepatitis flares, as fatal hepatitis may result. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Anti-HBV therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia due to autoimmune disorders who have severe vasculitic manifestations (eg, glomerulonephritis, cutaneous ulcers, progressive neuropathy) should receive immunosuppressive therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> as an alternative) and glucocorticoids. The regimen is similar to the regimen used for all other patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia and severe manifestations. In patients with mild to moderate clinical manifestations, therapy is directed at the underlying etiology. (See <a href=\"#H6575895\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune disorders'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia due to lymphoma should be referred to an appropriate specialist and treated for the underlying malignancy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> is commonly used in the treatment of B-cell lymphomas typically associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia. (See <a href=\"#H6575986\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasional patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia may have no identifiable underlying disorder. Therapy depends upon the severity of the clinical manifestations (see <a href=\"#H571879\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic disease'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe manifestations (eg, glomerulonephritis, cutaneous ulcers, progressive neuropathy) &ndash; In such patients, the immunosuppressive protocols outlined above should be followed. (See <a href=\"#H17909552\" class=\"local\">'Choice of immunosuppressive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild to moderate manifestation &ndash; Such patients can be managed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> orally) or low doses of glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 10 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. If prednisone is used, we attempt to taper the dose to less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> by six months, depending upon patient response. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 10-year survival among patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia varies depending upon organ involvement and the underlying cause of the disorder, ranging from 20 to 80 percent. However, the short-term prognosis in patients with very severe manifestations is generally poor, particularly for the patients who develop acute pulmonary hemorrhage, intestinal vasculitis with gastrointestinal hemorrhage or ischemia, or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
