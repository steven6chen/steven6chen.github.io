The epoxide reductase is needed to recycle vitamin K between reduced and epoxide forms. Without gamma carboxylation, the vitamin K-dependent factors, including factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, are immunologically detectable, but they cannot function because they cannot adequately bind calcium and phospholipid membranes needed for their hemostatic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Thus, the ultimate anticoagulant effect of VKAs is delayed until the previously synthesized, functional clotting factors are cleared from the circulation. Depletion of both factor X and factor II (prothrombin) is important for clinical efficacy, and factor II has the longest half-life of the vitamin K-dependent factors (approximately three days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Thus, the desired anticoagulant effect of a VKA does not occur for at least three days after drug initiation despite prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) at earlier time points. The initial prolongation of the PT is due primarily to depletion of factor VII, which has a short half-life (four to six hours) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50940\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50940 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1163176\" class=\"local\">'PT/INR prolongation'</a> below.)</p><p>VKAs also inhibit vitamin K-dependent gamma carboxylation of the anticoagulant factors protein S and protein C, which inhibit activated factors VIII and V. Thus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> has a transient procoagulant effect during the first day or two of use. This is rarely of clinical significance, with the possible exception of patients who receive &quot;loading doses&quot; of warfarin (especially those with inherited protein C deficiency) who may (rarely) develop warfarin-induced skin necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Most laboratories and portable devices report the results of the PT along with an INR, a parameter that allows comparison of PT values from different institutions. PT readings from different institutions cannot be accurately compared, because different laboratories often use different assay reagents that could produce different PT readings for the same plasma sample. The INR standardizes the PT value to an international reference thromboplastin standard. The three reference standards in use are thromboplastin made from recombinant human tissue factor reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, or thromboplastin from rabbit or bovine (cow) origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

The full anticoagulant effect of a VKA generally occurs within approximately one week after the initiation of therapy and results in equilibrium levels of functional factors II, IX, and X at approximately 10 to 35 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The clinical implications of the delay in full anticoagulation were demonstrated in a trial that compared treatment with a VKA alone or a VKA overlapped with intravenous heparin in patients with an acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The trial was terminated early (after accrual of 120 patients) due to an excess of symptomatic thromboembolic events in the VKA alone group. This delay in full anticoagulation despite prolongation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> during initial therapy provides the rationale for overlapping another anticoagulant such as a parenteral agent with a VKA during the initial days of therapy (so called &quot;bridging&quot;) in patients with an especially high thromboembolic risk.

At a conference on anticoagulation, approximately three-quarters of the 250 participants reported using a TTR measure as a quality indicator for their anticoagulation services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. TTR can be calculated using a variety of methods (eg, linear interpolation between INR values; percent of INRs in range, cross section of in-range INRs at a single time point) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The TTR reported depends on the method of calculation as well as the INR range considered &quot;therapeutic.&quot; A TTR of 65 to 70 percent is considered to be a reasonable and achievable degree of INR control in most settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Warfarin for intravenous (IV) administration is also available, and sublingual administration has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/1,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,13</a>]. The manufacturer discontinued production of the IV formulation in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Commercially available <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acenocoumarol-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acenocoumarol</a> are racemic mixtures of S and R enantiomers. S-warfarin is more potent than R-warfarin. S-warfarin is metabolized primarily by the hepatic cytochrome P-450 2C9 isoform (CYP2C9); R-warfarin also undergoes a small degree of hepatic metabolism by other P-450 cytochromes (eg, 1A2, 3A4) and is excreted in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, the overall anticoagulant effect of warfarin is more likely to be influenced by <em>CYP2C9</em> genotype and CYP2C9 drug interactions (eg, medications, over-the-counter herbal remedies) than by <em><span class=\"nowrap\">CYP1A2/CYP3A4</em></span> genotype or other drug interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the relative importance of the S versus the R enantiomer may vary among patients depending on patient comorbidities, medications, and genetic factors (see <a href=\"#H1162421\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidities'</a> below and <a href=\"#H447124\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2453997\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> below). Phenprocoumon is also metabolized by CYP2C9, but levels appear to be less influenced by <em>CYP2C9</em> genotype.</p><p>Tecarfarin (ATI-5923) is a VKA in development that is not affected by the CYP2C9 system; it is metabolized by esterases rather than CYPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Accordingly, it is not susceptible to many of the genetic and medication effects common to the other VKAs. However, in a 2016 trial that randomly assigned 607 individuals who required anticoagulation to receive tecarfarin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, the TTR was similar between the two drugs, even in patients who were receiving CYP2C9-interacting drugs, suggesting that this potential benefit may not be clinically relevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>VKAs differ in their half-lives:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Warfarin</a> &ndash; 36 to 42 hours (slightly less than two days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acenocoumarol-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acenocoumarol</a> &ndash; 8 to 11 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Phenprocoumon</strong> &ndash; three to five days or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluindione</strong> &ndash; 69 hours (slightly less than three days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-warfarin-and-modulators-of-inr-control/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]</p><p/><p>A variety of environmental and genetic factors further influence the absorption, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the VKAs, leading to great inter- and intra-patient variability in anticoagulant response.

Full anticoagulation requires factor X and factor II (prothrombin) activities both to be depleted to approximately 20 percent of normal. During warfarin initiation, full anticoagulation may take up to three days, and the initial prolongation of the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(PT/INR)</span> does not reflect full anticoagulation, because only factor VII is initially depleted (along with the anticoagulant factors protein S and protein C). This is the basis for overlapping (&quot;bridging&quot;) with another anticoagulant (generally unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin) in the initiation of warfarin anticoagulation in individuals at high thromboembolic risk. The primary metabolism of VKAs is in the liver, by the hepatic cytochrome P-450 2C9 isoform. Half-lives of different VKAs differ substantially.

The goal is to maintain a moderate, constant level of intake rather than to eliminate vitamin K from the diet.

Most increase the risk of bleeding, either by prolonging the INR (eg, antibiotics), interfering with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a> metabolism (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>), or altering other components of hemostasis (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]). Patients should be advised to discuss any new medication or supplement with their clinician, and clinicians are advised to evaluate potentially important interactions when introducing a new medication. In general, these interactions are avoided or minimized when possible; if interacting drugs must be used, monitoring frequency should be increased. (See <a href=\"#H447124\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking and alcohol may alter the anticoagulant effect of VKAs.
