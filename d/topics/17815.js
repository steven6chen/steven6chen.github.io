Of women who present with infertility, 25 to 50 percent are estimated to also have endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of female infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF INFERTILITY FROM ENDOMETRIOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While endometriosis is known to impair fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], mechanisms of infertility associated with endometriosis are uncertain and likely depend, in part, on the stage of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Endometriosis is surgically staged using the American Society of Reproductive Medicine staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66366\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66366 \">figure 1</a>). The spectrum of disease ranges from minimal presence of ectopic tissue (eg, 1 to 5 mm implants on the pelvic peritoneum) to severe anatomic distortion (deep ovarian endometriomas, major pelvic adhesions with obliteration of normal pelvic organ relationships). Mild disease appears to incite inflammatory pathways while advanced disease causes anatomic disruption in addition to the inflammatory response.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although Stage I (minimal) or II (mild) endometriosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66366\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66366 \">figure 1</a>) may be identified during an infertility evaluation, it is uncertain if early-stage disease is the cause of infertility in these women. It is hypothesized that <span class=\"nowrap\">minimal/mild</span> endometriosis is associated with an inflammatory response that results from overproduction of prostaglandins, metalloproteinases, cytokines, and chemokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], as well as macrophages and natural killer cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The resultant inflammatory process impairs ovarian, peritoneal, tubal, and endometrial function, and leads to defective folliculogenesis, fertilization, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Support for this theory comes from studies reporting that women with endometriosis have increased numbers of macrophages and cytokines in their peritoneal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>], and that their peritoneal fluid inhibits both sperm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and fallopian tube ciliary function in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, eutopic endometrium may not function normally in women with endometriosis, which could impair implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Progesterone resistance may also be involved and related to a reduction in the concentration of progesterone receptors and progesterone coactivators (eg, Hic-5) in the endometrium of women with endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced endometriosis (Stage III or IV disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66366\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66366 \">figure 1</a>) is associated with distorted pelvic anatomy and adhesions. These changes can impair oocyte release or pick-up, alter sperm motility, cause disordered myometrial contractions, and impair fertilization and embryo transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The chemical and immunologic mechanisms discussed above for <span class=\"nowrap\">mild/moderate</span> disease likely contribute as well. In a study of monkeys with experimentally induced endometriosis, the pregnancy rate was approximately 40 percent in normal controls, but only 12 percent in animals with advanced endometriosis and 0 percent if ovarian adhesions were present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As a comparison, minimal endometriosis did not diminish the pregnancy rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Advanced endometriosis may also negatively impact the ovarian follicles. Compared with women who have mild endometriosis or tubal factor infertility, studies on women with advanced endometriosis have reported abnormal folliculogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and reduced fertilization potential of oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infertility may be caused by endometriosis alone or endometriosis combined with other factors, both male and female. For women who present with endometriosis and infertility, we proceed with an infertility evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111458\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111458 \">algorithm 1</a>). We then assess the need to perform primary surgery for staging and treatment of endometriosis or repeat surgery to treat pain symptoms. Choice of infertility therapy is based on the combination of findings from the infertility evaluation and surgical staging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684626066\"><span class=\"h2\">Perform infertility evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not assume that endometriosis is the sole cause of the infertility. Couples who present with infertility proceed with evaluation for contributing male and female factors as reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-male-with-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the male with infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8579063\"><span class=\"h2\">Assess need for endometriosis surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometriosis is a chronic disease that requires life-long management with the goal of maximizing medical treatment and avoiding repeated surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Primary laparoscopic surgery is indicated for staging and treating of endometriosis, improving fertility, and reducing pain. Indications for repeat surgical treatment are mainly severe recurrent pain symptoms that impair quality of life or treatment of a symptomatic endometrioma. Repeat surgery does not improve fertility.</p><p>A description of surgical techniques for treatment of endometriosis are found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain#H234319540\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Surgical management of pelvic pain&quot;, section on 'Surgical procedures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3267405219\"><span class=\"h3\">Endometriosis symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with symptoms suggestive of endometriosis (eg, pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia) who have not had primary surgical treatment are candidates for primary surgical resection, typically with operative laparoscopy. Such women may have had endometriosis diagnosed, but not treated, at a prior surgery or may have imaging or examination findings that are highly suggestive of endometriosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3085085874\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2073464382\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>For women with infertility and symptoms of endometriosis, primary surgery to resect or ablate endometriosis increases postoperative pregnancy rates compared with diagnostic laparoscopy only. A meta-analysis reported that operative laparoscopy nearly doubled the live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates (57 verus 34 total live-births or pregnancies over 382 surgeries, odds ratio 1.94, 95% CI 1.20-3.16) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Surgical treatment consists of both resection and ablation. A description of surgical techniques for treatment of endometriosis is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain#H234319540\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Surgical management of pelvic pain&quot;, section on 'Surgical procedures'</a>.)</p><p>For women with continued severe pain and infertility after primary resection, repeat surgery can reduce pain but does not treat infertility. The major fertility benefit of surgical therapy is achieved shortly after the first procedure, and women who do not conceive after initial surgical treatment typically have worse disease and their pregnancy success is less, regardless of repeat surgical intervention. Clinicians must balance the limited benefits of second and third operative procedures to treat pain or other symptoms against the potential risks of major surgery and the lower likelihood of improved birth rate compared with assisted reproductive technology (ART) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Analysis of three observational studies that included 313 women reported lower pregnancy rates after repeat surgery compared with primary surgery for endometriosis (odds ratio 0.44, 95% CI 0.28-0.68) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, the pregnancy rate for women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) was similar to women undergoing repeat surgery (odds ratio 1.51, 95% CI 0.58-3.91). Thus, for women who have failed to conceive after primary surgical resection of endometriosis, we proceed directly with infertility therapy (See <a href=\"#H55481828\" class=\"local\">'Infertility therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8579264\"><span class=\"h3\">Endometrioma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with infertility and an asymptomatic endometrioma typically proceed with ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-32</a>]. Management of endometriomas is presented separately.

Other indications for endometrioma resection are discussed separately.

As the impact of asymptomatic endometriosis on fertility is not known, the risks associated with surgical resection are not warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55481828\"><span class=\"h2\">Infertility therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the couple has completed an infertility evaluation and the woman has undergone laparoscopic evaluation and treatment of endometriosis, if indicated, the couple proceeds with infertility therapy. Infertility treatment is guided by the type and number of infertility factors identified during the evaluation. For women with no or reversible problems, reversible causes are treated when present and subsequent therapy is guided by the stage of endometriosis. Women with non-reversible causes of infertility proceed directly with ART.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H311607934\"><span class=\"h3\">No or reversible infertility factors identified</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All potentially treatable infertility factors are first addressed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for female infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for male infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If there are no identified causes or if the woman does not conceive after treatment of reversible causes (eg, intrauterine polyps or fibroids), subsequent infertility treatment is then based upon the surgical stage of endometriosis and patient age. Endometriosis is surgically staged using the American Society of Reproductive Medicine staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66366\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66366 \">figure 1</a>). Cost, treatment availability, and patient preference also play a major role in the selection of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unexplained-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unexplained infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unexplained-infertility#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unexplained infertility&quot;, section on 'Our approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79307274\"><span class=\"h4\">Minimal or mild endometriosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with Stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> endometriosis have the options of natural conception, ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination, and ART, which includes in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection.</p><p>There is no consensus as to the optimal approach. ART is more effective but more costly and not always available or acceptable to the patient, while ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination (IUI) is less expensive, but when ineffective delays conception. While the selection of infertility treatment is based on medical indications, factors such as patient age, patient preference, procedure risk, birth rate, insurance coverage, and cost must also be considered. As an example, we would typically offer a woman younger than age 35 <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> ovulation induction and IUI because of the low risk of the treatment, low cost, and reasonable chance of conception. However, an identical woman may prefer to go directly to IVF to maximize her chance of a live birth despite the higher cost and invasive technique compared with ovulation induction and IUI.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women younger than 35 years who desire a trial of natural conception, we advise six months of timed intercourse. If conception does not occur within six months, we then offer ovulation induction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate and IUI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women younger than 35 years who prefer infertility treatment (rather than a trial of natural conception as above), or who do not conceive naturally, we advise proceeding with ovulation induction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate (CC) plus IUI. The intent of ovulation induction plus IUI is to enhance follicular development, ovulation, and luteal progesterone levels (to offset the associated progesterone resistance) while placing a large number of motile sperm high in the reproductive tract (and thus bypassing possible cervical factors) to facilitate fertilization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evidence from randomized trials shows that ovulation induction and IUI should be used together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], and that this combined therapy improves fecundability in women with early stage endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/33,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35-37</a>]. Women who do not conceive after three cycles of <span class=\"nowrap\">CC/IUI</span> are typically referred for ART.

Advancing directly to ART has been shown to shorten the time to pregnancy (median time to pregnancy 8 and 11 months, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In addition, ART offers the option of freezing excess embryos for future use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Historically, these women were offered gonadotropin ovulation induction and IUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/36,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,41,42</a>]. The use of <span class=\"nowrap\">gonadotropin/IUI</span> has fallen out of favor because of the increased rate of multiple gestations, including a rate of twin pregnancies of up to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. During ART, the number of embryos transferred into the uterus is controlled by the clinician.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For couples who do not desire or are unable to proceed with ART, we offer three to five cycles of CC or an aromatase inhibitor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, as clinically indicated, with IUI. The use of aromatase inhibitors in infertility therapy is discussed separately.

In this retrospective cohort study of 96 women who underwent operative laparoscopy for endometriosis, 12-month cumulative pregnancy rates did not statistically differ between natural and ovarian stimulation cycles (45 versus 42 percent for Stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> endometriosis and 20 and 10 percent for stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> endometriosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Repeat surgery does not improve fertility because even aggressive lysis of adhesions is accompanied by adhesion re-formation that may block normal tubal function and ovum pickup. Repeat surgery is only performed to treat persistent symptoms, such as severe pain.

While an earlier meta-analysis of 22 studies reported worsened in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes for women with mild endometriosis compared with other infertile women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], subsequent larger meta-analyses have consistently reported that women with minimal to mild endometriosis have similar live birth rates after IVF compared with women without endometriosis (relative risk [RR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.29-1.06 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84-1.06 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy and live birth rates'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to mild endometriosis, Stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> disease appears to negatively impacts ART outcomes. Three systematic reviews of 22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], 27 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], and 36 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] studies (with approximately 50 percent overlap between two of the studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]) reported lower oocyte retrieval, implantation, and pregnancy rates for women with advanced endometriosis undergoing IVF compared with women with mild endometriosis. In contrast, a much larger meta-analysis of 78 studies comprising over 20,000 women reported no difference among women with Stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> endometriosis and Stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> endometriosis in live birth rate (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11) and clinical pregnancy rate (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, women with advanced disease, particularly those with endometriomas, often have lower ovarian reserve and produce fewer oocytes for recovery, which reduces ART success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The impact of diminished ovarian reserve becomes more pronounced in women of older age whose declining egg quality is associated with greater embryo aneuploidy. In women with poor ovarian reserve, such as those with advanced age and severe endometriosis, we discuss the option to pursue ART with donor oocytes.</p><p>There is no evidence that ART increases the recurrence of endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, the use of ART in women with endometriosis does not appear to increase the risk of poor birth outcome, particularly preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79306407\"><span class=\"h1\">INEFFECTIVE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical therapy, including hormonal suppression, Chinese herbal medicine, nutritional supplements, and <span class=\"nowrap\">complementary/alternative</span> medicine have not been shown to improve pregnancy rates in women with endometriosis-related infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/33,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,53,54</a>]. Randomized clinical trials consistently report that hormone therapy with agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists for suppression of endometriosis does not improve fertility or pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/33,55-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,55-59</a>]. The lack of improvement applies to women treated with medical therapy alone, as well as those treated with combined medical and surgical therapy versus surgery alone. In contrast, for women whose treatment goal is pain reduction, hormonal suppression is an effective treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61270984\"><span class=\"h1\">FERTILITY PRESERVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As endometriosis can be associated with ovarian depletion and infertility, fertility preservation therapies such as embryo, oocyte, and ovarian tissue freezing have been proposed for women diagnosed with endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. These technologies, especially embryo and oocyte freezing, have proven efficacy for women planning treatment with gonadotoxic medications, such as chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment or gonadal resection&quot;, section on 'Cryopreservation'</a>.)</p><p>However, offering all women diagnosed with endometriosis additional fertility preservation treatment would be extremely expensive and place a significant strain on global health care costs without providing a clear advantage, as many of these women will conceive with a combination of the treatments reviewed above. Women who may benefit from this approach include those with bilateral endometriomas, prior ovarian surgery, and young age at diagnosis.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of infertility from endometriosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who present with endometriosis and infertility, we proceed with an infertility evaluation. We do not assume the endometriosis is the cause of infertility. We then assess the need to perform primary endometriosis surgery. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with symptoms suggestive of endometriosis (eg, pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia) who have not had primary surgical treatment, we recommend operative laparoscopy with ablation or excision of endometriosis implants as the first step in management after the infertility evaluation is complete (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Operative treatment is associated with improved pregnancy rates and reduced pain symptoms compared with diagnostic surgery alone. (See <a href=\"#H3267405219\" class=\"local\">'Endometriosis symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who have previously undergone primary surgical treatment of endometriosis, we suggest not repeating surgical removal of endometriosis for the treatment of infertility (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Repeat surgery does not improve fertility, although it can reduce pain. Thus, clinicians must balance the limited benefits of second and third operative procedures to treat pain or other symptoms against the potential risks of major surgery and the lower likelihood of improved birth rate compared with assisted reproductive technology (ART). (See <a href=\"#H3267405219\" class=\"local\">'Endometriosis symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with infertility and an asymptomatic presumed endometrioma, we generally proceed with ART and observation of the endometrioma rather than surgical removal. (See <a href=\"#H8579264\" class=\"local\">'Endometrioma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with endometriosis who have no symptoms other than infertility, surgical treatment to improve fertility is not indicated, even if the endometriosis has not been previously removed. As the impact of asymptomatic endometriosis on fertility is not known, the risks associated with surgical resection are not warranted. (See <a href=\"#H3982562563\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infertility therapy is guided by the combination of findings from the infertility evaluation and surgical staging of endometriosis as well as patient age. Cost and patient preferences also play a major role in treatment decisions. (See <a href=\"#H55481828\" class=\"local\">'Infertility therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women with no or reversible infertility factors, minimal to mild endometriosis (Stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II),</span> and age younger than 35 years are usually offered a trial of natural conception or continued infertility treatment with ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination (IUI). For women &ge;35 years of age with Stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> endometriosis, we proceed directly with ART because of the shortened time to pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H79307274\" class=\"local\">'Minimal or mild endometriosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women with no or reversible infertility factors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those with advanced endometriosis (Stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV)</span> are suggested to proceed directly with ART, typically in vitro fertilization when available. (See <a href=\"#H55482040\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe endometriosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with non-reversible infertility factors (eg, significant male factor component, decreased ovarian reserve), we generally proceed directly with ART rather than less invasive treatments because ART is more likely to result in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H3146068303\" class=\"local\">'Non-reversible infertility factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impact of endometriosis on ART outcomes is variable. Mild endometriosis (ie, Stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> disease) does not appear to negatively impact ART results. In contrast, the body of evidence suggests Stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> disease negatively impacts outcomes, although the data are conflicting. The mechanism appears to be decreased ovarian reserve.
