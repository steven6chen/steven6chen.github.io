The basic workup for shoulder pain should include assessment of the biceps tendon, which has been considered a common cause of shoulder pain since the 1930s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Biceps tendon injuries include a spectrum of disorders ranging from mild tendinopathy to complete tendon rupture. Rupture occurs most frequently at the long head of the proximal tendon, but may occur in the distal tendon. Coexistent injuries at the biceps tendon origin and superior glenoid labrum constitute a variety of disorder known as SLAP (superior labrum, anterior to posterior) lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. SLAP lesions are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=superior-labrum-anterior-posterior-slap-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) tears&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will discuss the presentation and management of biceps tendinopathy (primarily of the proximal long head of the biceps tendon) and biceps tendon rupture, both proximal and distal. The general evaluation of shoulder complaints in adults and other discrete causes of shoulder pain and dysfunction are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glenohumeral-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glenohumeral osteoarthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H40\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Proximal neuropathies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data describing the incidence of biceps tendon injury by sport or occupation is scant and should be interpreted cautiously. Such injuries appear to occur more often among those who engage in frequent pulling, lifting, reaching, or throwing for work or recreation. Two clinical series describe biceps tendon ruptures in rock climbers and weight lifters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p>Degenerative tendinosis and biceps tendon rupture are usually seen in older patients, while isolated tendonitis usually presents in the young or middle aged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. According to a single-center study from the United Kingdom, among older patients (seventh decade of life) biceps tendon ruptures occurred at a rate of 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">53/100,000</span> over five years, with a male to female ratio of 3:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This study did not distinguish among proximal and distal biceps tendon injuries. Based on clinical experience, proximal biceps tendon injuries are far more common.</p><p>The rate of distal biceps tendon rupture in the United States is 2.55 per 100,000 patient-years, according to a retrospective national database study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The median age at time of rupture was 46, males comprised 96 percent of cases, and rupture risk was associated with smoking and increased body mass index.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biceps muscle is made up of a long and short head, each of which has a unique proximal tendon origin on the scapula, but which share a distal attachment on the bicipital (radial) tuberosity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59976\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59976 \">figure 1</a>). Shoulder anatomy is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and biomechanics'</a>.)</p><p>The long head biceps tendon (LHBT) is divided into three clinically relevant zones, each with potentially distinct pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These zones include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inside &ndash; Includes superior labrum and biceps anchor. The biceps anchor is the proximal attachment site for the LHBT. The tendon anchor site can be the bony supraglenoid tubercle or the cartilaginous superior labrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Junction &ndash; Includes intra-articular portion of LHBT and pulley. The pulley is a capsulo-ligamentous complex that stabilizes the LHBT at the proximal portion of the bicipital groove. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tunnel &ndash; Includes extra-articular portion of LHBT </p><p/><p>The LHBT originates intra-articularly at the superior glenoid tubercle, where it contributes to the formation of the glenoid labrum. The precise origin of the LHBT exhibits considerable anatomic variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It primarily extends from the glenoid rim as a rope-like structure coursing over the head of the humerus, and then into the intertubercular groove of the humerus, where it is reinforced by a covering of thick fascia. The LHBT then extends distally to the musculotendinous junction where it merges into the long head of the biceps muscle. &#160;</p><p>The short head biceps tendon, together with the coracobrachialis muscle, originates at the coracoid process, medial to the long head tendon, and to the glenohumeral joint. Just distal from its origin, the short head separates from the coracobrachialis to form a distinct short head biceps tendon. As the proximal short head biceps tendon travels medial to the shoulder joint, and not below the acromion, it is far less susceptible to injury or tendinosis than the long head biceps tendon.</p><p>The two heads of the biceps muscle merge at the distal arm, ultimately forming a tendon that inserts onto the radial tuberosity. A bicipital aponeurosis provides an additional distal attachment by merging with the fascia over the forearm flexors and inserting onto the ulna.</p><p>The major functions of the biceps brachii muscle are supination of the forearm and flexion of the elbow. The proximal long head of the biceps may contribute to stabilizing the humeral head anteriorly, but this remains a subject of debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The biceps is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some experts believe that proximal biceps tendon injury is not due to a unique mechanism but rather results from general shoulder pathology, such as impingement or instability. Shoulder impingement is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-impingement-syndrome#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder impingement syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Underlying shoulder dysfunction, including problems with the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers, contributes to tendon injury within the bicipital grove, below the acromion, or at the labral attachment. The injury may or may not be associated with acute inflammation, and so is referred to as a tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Rotator cuff lesions or impingement alters shoulder mechanics, thereby stressing the proximal long head biceps tendon (LHBT) by repetitive tensile overload or tendon instability. The LHBT suffers a pathologic progression from tendinitis to chronic tenosynovitis to degenerative tendinosis. A thickened LHBT from tendinosis can become entrapped within the bicipital groove [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Additional mechanisms of injury to the LHBT include medial subluxation of the tendon within the biceps groove (caused by variations in osseous anatomy), compromise of the bicipital sling (covering fascia), and rotator cuff pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Congenital anatomic variations of the bicipital groove may predispose the LHBT to subluxation or friction-related tendinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Possible variations include a shallow intertubercular groove, a shallow medial wall, and osseous spurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The frequency of LHBT tendon tears increases with age, suggesting that chronic degeneration predisposes to rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rupture of the proximal, long biceps tendon is often associated with rotator cuff tears. The mechanism of injury to the LHBT typically involves a load applied during eccentric contraction of the biceps muscle. Examples include lowering one's body during the decent phase of a pullup, catching a heavy object that falls unexpectedly, or shoveling heavy snow. </p><p>The mechanism for distal biceps tendon ruptures also involves eccentric contraction of the biceps muscle. Typically, such injuries involve a sudden forceful extension of the person's flexed elbow when the biceps muscle is already fully contracted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain from biceps tendinopathy is classically described as focused in the anterior shoulder with radiation distally over the biceps muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The pain is aggravated by lifting, pulling, or repetitive overhead activities. However, there is no reliably specific pain pattern for disorders involving the long head biceps tendon (LHBT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients may complain of a painful arc of shoulder motion associated with a click and pain that worsens at night. There may be a history of an inciting event, but usually the symptoms are gradual in onset. Some patients complain of a catching or snapping sensation if instability predominates. &#160;</p><p>Whether biceps tendinopathy represents a unique cause of shoulder pain remains a source of debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other shoulder ailments (eg, rotator cuff tendinopathy) often coexist.</p><p>Acute tendon rupture usually occurs during a specific traumatic event that causes a sudden &quot;pop&quot; accompanied by pain, ecchymosis, and swelling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74356\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74356 \">picture 1</a>). If chronic shoulder pain was present prior to the acute rupture, the patient may report improvement in such pain following rupture of the LHBT. Patients experiencing a proximal LHBT rupture may notice a distinct demarcation of the proximal muscle belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80748\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80748 \">picture 2</a>). This deformity is commonly referred to as a &quot;Popeye&quot; deformity, named for the cartoon character whose biceps were drawn as a focal bulge in the middle of the upper arm. The deformity is more easily seen in a well-muscled individual and potentially obscured in the obese or elderly with little muscle mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Patients who sustain a complete distal biceps tendon tear may describe feeling a sudden popping or tearing sensation in the antecubital fossa at the time of injury. In addition, many experience weakness and pain with elbow flexion and supination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Partial tears of the distal biceps exhibit deep antecubital pain worsened by active supination. Unlike LHBT tears, obvious deformity is usually not present. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2556343463\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach and overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Performance of the shoulder examination is discussed in detail separately. The portions of this examination of particular relevance to biceps tendinopathy and tendon rupture are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examination begins with inspection of both shoulders looking for asymmetry in the biceps muscles, acromioclavicular joint, and anterior shoulder. The neurovascular function of the upper extremities should be assessed in all patients. It is extremely important that the examination is performed with adequate exposure. Subtle muscular atrophy and deformities will be missed if the shoulders remain covered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Various examination maneuvers are used to diagnose biceps tendinopathy or tendon strain. Among the most common are palpation of the long head of the biceps tendon, Speed's test, and Yergason's test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61303\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61303 \">picture 3</a>). We use this combination of tests, along with musculoskeletal ultrasound, to determine the presence of biceps tendinopathy. A biceps tendon rupture is readily identifiable in the large majority of cases using the history, inspection of the arm, and palpation, but ultrasound is a useful adjunct.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13253990\"><span class=\"h2\">Long head (proximal) biceps tendon evaluation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1233813425\"><span class=\"h3\">Inspection and palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The upper extremity of patients with proximal biceps tendinitis or tendinopathy generally appear normal. Examination of a ruptured proximal long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) performed soon after the injury occurred may show proximal upper arm swelling and ecchymoses. These signs may resolve if the initial presentation is delayed. The &quot;Popeye&quot; deformity is visible as a sagging biceps muscle with a sharp myotendinous demarcation and loss of the usual, more gradual contour of the proximal biceps just below the anterior deltoid. However, rupture can be surprisingly hard to diagnose in obese patients, in whom the classic &quot;Popeye&quot; deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80748\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80748 \">picture 2</a>) may be obscured by adipose tissue, and in some elderly patients with little muscle mass.</p><p>Palpation over the proximal LHBT at the bicipital groove typically elicits tenderness in patients with tendinopathy. Point tenderness directly over the biceps tendon has long been regarded as pathognomonic for biceps tendon injury. Although one case series found palpation to be neither highly sensitive nor specific, this study assessed for biceps tendon tear only in a select group of patients undergoing arthroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Difficulty in isolating the biceps tendon during physical examination, particularly in patients with significant adipose tissue or muscle overlying the anterior shoulder, may decrease the accuracy of palpation. Some experts suggest that the proximal LHBT is easier to isolate by placing the elbow against the patient's torso and flexed to 90 degrees, with the shoulder externally rotated 30 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. We use this positioning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70699 \">picture 4</a>). </p><p>Several methods have been described for improving the accuracy of biceps tendon palpation. We prefer identifying the greater tubercle of the humerus by palpation first, and then moving our fingers slightly medially into the bicipital groove. The shoulder can then be externally and internally rotated while feeling the biceps tendon roll under the examining finger. At this point, extending and flexing the elbow allows for appreciation of tendon movement, and crepitus if present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70699 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82898\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef82898 \">movie 1</a>). Common problems in examining the biceps tendon include palpating too distally and attempting the examination with the shoulder internally rotated. One study reported poor correlation between direct palpation of the LHBT and identification of tendon position using ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Clinicians skilled in musculoskeletal ultrasound can use it to identify the biceps tendon and examine it under direct visualization, a standard part of our evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13253971\"><span class=\"h3\">Special tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two commonly performed examination maneuvers for biceps injury are the Speed's and Yergason's tests. To perform Speed's test, the patient's arm is extended in full supination with the shoulder flexed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61303\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61303 \">picture 3</a>). In this position the patient is asked to elevate the arm against a resisted isometric force applied by the examiner (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82896\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef82896 \">movie 2</a>). A test that elicits pain in the anterior shoulder is considered positive. A review of three studies using Speed's test reported the sensitivity to be 57 percent, specificity 52 percent, and overall accuracy 61 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The poor specificity reflects the frequent coexistence of other shoulder pathologies (eg, rotator cuff injury) when biceps tendinopathy is present.</p><p>Yergason's test is performed with the patient's arm pronated and flexed at the elbow to 90 degrees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61303\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61303 \">picture 3</a>). The patient then attempts to supinate the arm against a resisted isometric force provided by the examiner (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82897\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef82897 \">movie 3</a>). Pain localized to the long biceps tendon marks a positive test. Yergason reasoned this test would isolate biceps tendon injury from rotator cuff pathology. A study of 50 patients, using arthroscopy as the gold standard, found Yergason's test to have a sensitivity of 43 percent, specificity of 79 percent, and positive likelihood ratio of 2.05 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The studies described here reflect the general surgical literature, which suggests that neither Speed's test nor Yergason's test provide much help in distinguishing biceps tendon pathology from other causes of anterior shoulder pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In other words, these tests increase the post-test probability of biceps pathology only slightly when positive and when negative do not aid diagnosis.</p><p>However, the results of such studies should interpreted cautiously. These studies include only patients selected for arthroscopy and may not reflect the broader patient population that presents to primary care and sports medicine clinics with shoulder complaints. Furthermore, surgical studies generally focus on the presence of tendon tear to assess the accuracy of physical examination tests. The presence of tendinopathy is more difficult to assess.</p><p>One study using MRI as the gold standard for biceps pathology found a sensitivity of 68.5 percent and specificity of 55.5 percent for Speed's test and sensitivity of 37 percent and specificity of 86 percent for Yergason's test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This study is consistent with surgical studies and suggests that physical examination tests have limited accuracy for diagnosing biceps tendon pathology. Of note, MRI itself has demonstrated relatively poor specificity and sensitivity for biceps tendinopathy and partial tendon tears. Using ultrasonography as the standard for biceps tendinitis, sensitivity of Speed's and Yergason's tests were only 63 percent and 32 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Deformity from a complete tear of the distal tendon &ndash; a &quot;Reverse Popeye&quot; deformity - is an unreliable finding, as an intact lacertus fibrosis (bicipital aponeurosis) can obscure the underlying retracted biceps tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Palpation usually reveals tenderness at the distal biceps tendon, or possibly a tendon stump at the radial tuberosity. However, partial biceps tendon tears may also be tender at these locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. While elbow motion is usually preserved in patients with a distal biceps tendon tear, forearm supination and elbow flexion strength are diminished. Pain increases with resisted elbow flexion or supination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4042764696\"><span class=\"h3\">Special tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Special maneuvers used to evaluate the distal biceps tendon include the biceps squeeze and hook tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The biceps squeeze test is similar to the Thompson squeeze test used to assess Achilles tendon integrity. If the distal biceps tendon is intact, a firm squeeze of the biceps muscle causes forearm supination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F109957\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef109957 \">movie 4</a>). In one observational study, 21 of 22 patients with a positive test had a complete tear of the distal biceps tendon confirmed at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>To perform the hook test, the patient flexes the affected elbow to 90 degrees with the forearm fully supinated. The examiner then attempts to &quot;hook&quot; the distal biceps tendon with their index finger and pull it forward (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F109956\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109956 \">picture 5</a>). An intact tendon moves forward. A partially intact tendon will move forward, but the action is accompanied by pain. If no tendon can be found, this marks a positive test for complete distal biceps tendon rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3552701103\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the initial diagnosis and treatment of both long head biceps tendon (LHBT) tendinopathy and LHBT rupture is typically conservative, advanced diagnostic imaging plays a limited role in the workup. For clinicians trained in musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK US), this technique has become a standard part of the shoulder examination, including patients with possible LHBT pathology. Despite the limited role of advanced imaging for proximal biceps pathology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful when the clinical diagnosis is complicated by patient factors (eg, limited physical examination), when there is a need to evaluate for concomitant shoulder pathology (eg, rotator cuff or labral tear), or for surgical planning (eg, planned biceps tenodesis or tenotomy). The short head of the biceps tendon is rarely injured and limited information exists about using MSK US to make this diagnosis.</p><p>Conversely, diagnosis of a distal biceps tendon rupture using only clinical signs can be challenging and treatment typically involves expedited surgical management. Therefore, diagnostic imaging plays an important role in management. While MSK US is an accurate and useful tool for assessment of proximal biceps tendon pathology, imaging of the distal biceps tendon is technically challenging and this may limit ultrasound's usefulness with distal tendon pathology in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Special views may help the experienced ultrasonographer better visualize the distal biceps tendon in some patients, and allow for better sensitivity and specificity in identifying complete tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasound-of-the-elbow#H2983342444\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the elbow&quot;, section on 'Anterior elbow'</a>). However, in most settings when there is clinical concern for a distal biceps tendon rupture, urgent MRI is usually performed. </p><p>Our approach to diagnostic imaging when either tendinopathy or rupture of the LHBT is our leading diagnosis begins with MSK US, which is an excellent tool for imaging the proximal biceps tendon in the bicipital groove [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/9,28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,28-32</a>]. Performance of the ultrasound examination of the shoulder, including the biceps tendon, is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasound-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the shoulder&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1447198081\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MSK US appears to have high sensitivity and specificity for identifying normal tendons and complete tears of the LHBT. Accuracy is more limited with partial tears and other tendon pathology (eg, tendinopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>MSK US enables the trained clinician to evaluate the structural appearance of bicep tendons and to perform a dynamic examination that allows for comparison with the contralateral shoulder at the bedside. The LHBT can be sonographically assessed from proximal to distal, beginning in the rotator interval, moving through the intertubercular groove (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72784\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72784 \">image 1</a>), and ending at the myotendinous junction. The most proximal aspect of the tendon cannot be assessed with ultrasound due to its subacromial position. The normal sonographic appearance of the LHBT exhibits a tightly packed hyperechoic fibrillar pattern of uniform thickness. Pathologic tendons appear hypoechoic, possibly with focally thickened segments. Partial tears display disruptions to the uniform tendon fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Signs of structural degeneration, such as loss of normal compact fibular tendon architecture and focal areas of tendon discontinuity or abnormal blood flow, can help to identify tendinopathy and suggest an increased risk for rupture. </p><p>Supination and pronation of the forearm, performed either independently or in combination with internal and external rotation of the shoulder, can reveal LHBT subluxation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99363\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99363 \">image 2</a>) or frank dislocation of the tendon from the bicipital groove. LHBT instability is often associated with biceps tendinopathy and tears of the subscapularis tendon. With LHBT rupture, absence of the tendon in the bicipital groove using a short axis view helps to confirm the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99359\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99359 \">image 3</a>). Using a long axis view, the presence of a tendon &quot;step-off&quot; along with hypoechoic changes in the soft tissue provides additional confirmatory evidence. </p><p>In addition, studies of MSK US in high-risk groups suggest that ultrasound is useful for identifying less pronounced biceps tendon pathology, which may predispose to future injury. As an example, a study of Olympic-level swimmers found that a high percentage showed signs of tendinosis in the LHBT (72 percent) and in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons (96 percent) when screened with US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Specific findings seen in short axis view that are associated with overuse tendinopathy include calcifications within the tendon and hypoechoic changes with thickening. Abnormal &quot;neo-vessels&quot; within the tendon may also develop. When there is fluid within the biceps tendon sheath, this is visible on both short and long axis scan. Significant fluid on short axis may reveal a hypoechoic circle around the more hyperechoic tendon such that the tendon appears like a bullseye. On long axis view, the hypoechoic fluid outlines the superficial and deep surfaces of the tendon. If bicipital peritendinous effusion is found, the ultrasonographer must carefully examine all the major rotator cuff structures, as this finding occurs with rotator cuff pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H849616533\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional ultrasound resources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instructional videos demonstrating proper performance of the ultrasound examination of the shoulder and related pathology can be found at the website of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine: <a href=\"https://www.amssm.org/TestingDetails.php?IDtest=81&amp;token=+CjrhIBVW0jZK35njTvgceBoc89/qjKZO3f/yKxTQKSohmLSi4ETNC5L3Quc15hVGSogCh5tqCZRz8ZxoofOaw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=229\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">sports US shoulder pathology</a>.

However, plain radiographs may assist in the evaluation of confounding shoulder pathology and can reveal subacromial spurring or anatomic variants of the acromion that may cause impingement and contribute to proximal biceps tendon pathology. We use plain radiographs for individuals with clinical findings suggestive of degenerative changes or impingement that could complicate the diagnosis of LHBT pathology. Therefore, in patients with a history that includes restricted shoulder motion or mechanical symptoms, such as painful popping or clicking, who also manifest examination findings such as reduced passive range of motion, crepitus, or impingement, we generally obtain plain radiographs of the shoulder. The outlet or scapular Y view allows the clinician to assess acromial architecture. Additional views of the bicipital groove have been described to evaluate the anatomy of the groove and detect spurs, but we feel these are likely to be far less useful than MSK US or MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2322537376\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI of the shoulder allows for detailed visualization of the biceps tendon and associated shoulder pathology, such as rotator cuff or labral tears. However, the sensitivity and specificity of MRI for diagnosing proximal biceps tendon pathology is limited, and the absence of pathologic findings on MRI is <strong>not</strong> sufficient to rule out biceps tendon pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Overall, multiple observational studies report that MRI demonstrates high specificity for complete LHBT tears, but specificity is low for partial tears and for tendinopathy, and sensitivity is low all pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/36,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38,39</a>].

MRI is particularly limited in the evaluation of the intra-articular portion of the LHBT. </p><p>Because of these issues, MRI is usually reserved for evaluation of more severe pathology, such as potential labral injuries in the region of the LHBT origin or superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) tears, or for patients whose symptoms persist despite appropriate conservative therapy, possibly including physical therapy and ultrasound-guided injections of analgesics and glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In these instances MRI arthrogram is usually preferred. MRI can also be useful in patients where technical factors limit ultrasound evaluation or for surgeons contemplating operative repair. Given these limits of MRI, it is best to collaborate with the radiologist and possibly the orthopedic surgeon before performing such studies.

Biceps tendon injury can be difficult to distinguish from rotator cuff pathology, and the two often coexist. Both may stem from underlying shoulder dysfunction. Therefore, when the diagnosis of biceps tendon injury is considered, it is important to perform a thorough evaluation of the shoulder. Rotator cuff tendinopathy or tear, subacromial impingement, shoulder instability, or labral pathology may be present.

Patients with anterior shoulder pain whose examination reveals no abnormalities in rotator cuff testing but who manifest a positive speeds or Yergason tests are more likely to have isolated tendinopathy of the LHBT. Subscapularis tendon tears are often associated with LHBT subluxation. Examination findings associated with rotator cuff tears include weakness with focal muscle testing, a painful arc of motion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70787\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70787 \">picture 6</a>), and a positive drop arm sign (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82880\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef82880 \">movie 5</a>).

Both passive and active glenohumeral motion are limited, unlike LHBT pathology where passive glenohumeral motion is usually not limited. In addition, motion restrictions with frozen shoulder most often involve external rotation and abduction, which helps to distinguish the condition from LHBT pathology.

The LHBT is nontender in cases of isolated AC joint pathology. Pain with the cross body adduction test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55432\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55432 \">picture 7</a>) strongly suggests pathology of the AC joint rather than the biceps tendon.

Shoulder pain may also be referred from diseases of the chest (eg, acute coronary syndrome) or abdomen (eg, gallbladder disease).

These include degenerative changes from osteoarthritis, capsular injury, and osteochondral defect or a related loose body (eg, cartilage fragment). Intra-articular elbow pathology is suggested by the presence of a joint effusion and by diminished elbow range of motion. Definitive diagnosis is made with advanced imaging. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Median mononeuritis</strong> &#8210; Rarely, median mononeuritis can present primarily as anterior elbow pain.

Diagnosis can be&nbsp;confirmed by&nbsp;MRI or ultrasound imaging of the elbow.&nbsp;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies to determine the best method for diagnosing tendinopathy of the long head of the proximal biceps tendon (LHBT) are limited. We make the diagnosis primarily based upon clinical findings. Patients who complain of anterior shoulder pain, particularly those who gesture to the area of the long biceps tendon, demonstrate marked asymmetrical and focal tenderness of the tendon compared with the opposite shoulder, and have a positive Yergason's test are likely to have tendinopathy of the LHBT. We have found musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK US) to be a useful diagnostic tool. In addition, US guided injections of analgesics into the bicipital groove can be both diagnostic and therapeutic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>The history and examination are generally sufficient to make a preliminary diagnosis of LHBT rupture. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the physical examination for tendon tears is limited, and MSK US is an important tool for confirming the diagnosis in some cases. MSK US reveals a torn or absent tendon in nearly all cases, and in experienced hands can help to identify partial tears and subluxations. Although generally not necessary, MRI can provide a definitive diagnosis.</p><p>Distal biceps tendon tear, partial or complete, is more difficult to diagnose than LHBT tear. Clinical findings may be suggestive, but MRI is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis.

For the majority of less active patients or older inactive patients, the decrease in strength incurred from a tendon rupture is of little significance. Conservative management is appropriate for this group and referral is generally not needed.</p><p>Nevertheless, some patients with proximal biceps tendon rupture are treated with surgical repair. The decision to pursue surgical treatment is based primarily upon the patient's level of function and personal preferences. It is appropriate to obtain orthopedic consultation for proximal biceps tendon ruptures in athletes involved in sports that require significant upper extremity power, patients whose occupation depends to a significant degree upon arm strength, and other highly active patients. Observational data suggests that the loss of the long head biceps tendon (proximal tear) results in a mild to moderate decrease in strength and muscular endurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>], while a rupture of the distal biceps tendon can lead to significant strength loss, particularly with supination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. Some patients may request repair for cosmetic reasons. For cases that may merit surgical repair, referral should be obtained within two weeks of the injury. &#160;</p><p>Patients with significant, chronic LHBT pain that is resistant to conservative treatment may be candidates for biceps tenodesis or tenotomy. Orthopedic referral is appropriate in such instances. However, patients should be advised that evidence supporting the effectiveness of biceps tenodesis and tenotomy is weak, and the procedures are associated with potential complications that can substantially decrease patient satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p>Proximal biceps tendon injuries are frequently associated with rotator cuff tears and patients may need surgical intervention to repair such tears.

Patient education and discussion of the indications for surgery are important. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic referral'</a> above.)</p><p>Initial management of biceps tendinopathy involves rest and a brief trial of antiinflammatory medications. Many clinicians give a short course (five to seven days) of oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We sometimes apply a topical NSAID gel for a locally tender, superficial biceps tendon. Some patients appear to benefit. However, topical NSAID treatment for biceps tendinopathy has not been rigorously studied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2266501595\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid injection for tendinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some clinicians inject glucocorticoid into the subacromial space or the biceps tendon sheath. Subacromial injections may reduce inflammation from subacromial impingement and, if a rotator cuff tear is present, may reduce inflammation in the biceps tendon sheath. Direct injections of the biceps tendon sheath can be technically challenging. The use of ultrasound-guided injection may improve safety and accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>The authors often offer glucocorticoid injection into the sheath of the long head biceps tendon (LHBT) under ultrasound (US) guidance to patients with persistent pain (six weeks or more of symptoms), particularly those who have had a poor response to other conservative treatments (eg, NSAIDs, physical therapy, and activity modification). This often provides substantial symptomatic relief and confirms that the LHBT is the source of the shoulder pain. </p><p>Distal biceps tendon sheath injections are technically challenging even under US guidance. We suggest such treatment only in cases of chronic distal biceps tendon pain unresponsive to conservative care and for which advanced imaging (MRI) confirms that surgical treatment is not indicated. </p><p>It should be noted that glucocorticoid injections have been associated with tendon rupture. Such ruptures, although often attributed by the patient to the glucocorticoid, may occur spontaneously in a pathologic tendon. Also, postinjection rupture may occur as the patient, relieved of pain, prematurely pursues strenuous activities. We advise patients to avoid any such activity for 72 hours following such an injection. Clinicians should discuss the risk of tendon rupture prior to injection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2283600726\"><span class=\"h2\">Long head (proximal) biceps tendinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little evidence exists to guide the nonsurgical management of biceps tendinopathy. The approach described below is based upon observational data and our clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A follow-up interval of two to four weeks for acute biceps tendinopathy is reasonable.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and activity modification continue during this interval.</p><p>If symptoms associated with biceps tendinopathy are long-standing or unresponsive to initial conservative management, many clinicians suggest a trial of physical therapy. Treatment typically includes local therapies for symptom relief and a careful assessment of biomechanical faults, including the entire kinetic chain involved in the patient's major activities that may be contributing to injury. Biceps tendinopathy is often accompanied by rotator cuff pathology. Therefore, physical therapy generally involves range of motion and strengthening exercises for the biceps, rotator cuff, and scapular stabilizer muscle groups. Physical therapy for these conditions is reviewed in detail separately.

Patients with long-standing biceps tendinopathy who remain active in activities requiring forceful biceps contraction are at ever-present risk of rupturing the tendon.</p><p>With long head biceps tendon rupture (proximal tear), patients may experience persistent pain with certain activities and reductions in muscle strength and endurance of up to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. Through physical therapy, patients can regain a degree of this lost strength but some deficit will persist. However, for the majority of patients the strength loss is insignificant and does not interfere with daily activities. Patients with persistent pain or disability following a proximal biceps tendon rupture should be referred for orthopedic evaluation.

Physical therapy often plays an important role in improving the strength and flexibility of the biceps and shoulder muscles (eg, rotator cuff), which often contribute to the patient's symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Proximal long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) injuries are most common. Proximal biceps tendon injury can be difficult to distinguish from rotator cuff pathology, and the two often coexist. Shoulder instability, impingement syndrome, or labral injuries may also be present. Evaluation for these coexisting pathologies should be performed when entertaining the diagnosis of biceps tendon injury. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4273955717\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pain from LHBT tendinopathy is often focused in the anterior shoulder; the pain may radiate distally over the biceps muscle. Symptoms are often aggravated by lifting, pulling, or repetitive overhead activities. Patients may complain of a painful arc of motion associated with a click, and pain that worsens at night. Symptoms are gradual in onset. Acute LHBT rupture usually occurs during a specific traumatic event that causes sudden pain, a &quot;pop&quot; in the shoulder, ecchymosis, swelling, and abnormal tendon appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80748\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80748 \">picture 2</a>). Acute tear of the distal biceps tendon is much less common. It is often accompanied by a popping or tearing sensation in the antecubital fossa at the time of injury, and many patients experience weakness and pain with elbow flexion and supination. Unlike LHBT tears, obvious deformity is usually not present. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly used tests for making the diagnosis of LHBT injury are tendon palpation, Speed's test, and Yergason's test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61303\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61303 \">picture 3</a>). Evidence supporting the accuracy of these tests is limited; Yergason's test is relatively specific for biceps tendon injury but lacks sensitivity. Examination findings associated with distal tendon injury are less reliable. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We make the diagnosis of LHBT tendinopathy based primarily upon clinical findings. Patients who complain of anterior shoulder pain, particularly those who gesture to the area of the LHBT, demonstrate marked asymmetrical tenderness of the tendon compared with the opposite shoulder, and have a positive Yergason's test are likely to have biceps tendinopathy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the initial treatment of both LHBT tendinopathy and rupture is typically conservative, advanced diagnostic imaging plays a limited role in the initial workup. Ultrasound enables the trained clinician to evaluate tendons while they are in motion and to compare them with the contralateral shoulder at the bedside. Ultrasound has high sensitivity and specificity for complete tears of the LHBT. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed visualization of the biceps tendon, but its sensitivity and specificity are limited for some conditions involving the proximal biceps tendon, and it is usually reserved for evaluation of more severe or prolonged symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of a distal biceps tendon rupture using only clinical signs can be challenging, and therefore, diagnostic imaging plays an important role in the initial workup. Ultrasound may be useful, but MRI is often necessary. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2169517406\" class=\"local\">'Distal biceps tendon (anterior elbow pain)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest from aggravating activities, local or systemic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy, and subacromial or biceps tendon sheath injections form the core of conservative care for LHBT tendinopathy. Physical therapy generally involves range of motion and strengthening exercises for the biceps, rotator cuff, and scapular stabilizer muscle groups. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no indications for emergency referral for biceps tendon injuries. For most less-active patients or older inactive patients, the decrease in strength incurred with a proximal LHBT rupture is of little significance and conservative management is appropriate. Patients with a distal biceps tendon rupture should be referred for surgical consultation as early as possible, as some will require surgical repair. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthopedic consultation is appropriate when proximal biceps tendon rupture occurs in athletes involved in sports that require significant upper extremity power, patients whose occupation depends to a significant degree upon arm strength, and some other highly active patients. In contrast to proximal tendon injuries, rupture of the distal biceps tendon warrants early orthopedic referral. Referral may also be necessary for patients with significant biceps tendon pain that has been resistant to conservative treatment and some patients with cosmetic concerns.
