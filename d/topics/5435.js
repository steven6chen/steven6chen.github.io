Dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) will be reviewed here. Office procedures for endometrial sampling and an overview of diagnostic approaches to endometrial evaluation, including both noninvasive and invasive assessment, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-sampling-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial sampling procedures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>D&amp;C has both diagnostic and therapeutic indications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of equipment and techniques for office based endometrial sampling has obviated the need for diagnostic D&amp;C in most patients. Numerous studies have shown that the endometrium is adequately evaluated with sampling techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-sampling-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial sampling procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, there are still some indications for diagnostic D&amp;C, such as in women:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a nondiagnostic office biopsy who are at high risk of endometrial carcinoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With endometrial hyperplasia, and in whom endometrial cancer needs to be excluded.

Hysteroscopy thus turns a &quot;blind&quot; procedure into one allowing directed curettage. This helps to prevent missing unsuspected polyps and insures that the most visibly abnormal areas are sampled. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hysteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hysteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dilation and <span class=\"nowrap\">evacuation/curettage</span> (D&amp;EC) is used as a therapeutic modality in the following clinical settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of incomplete, inevitable, missed, septic, and induced abortions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous abortion: Risk factors, etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester pregnancy termination: Uterine aspiration&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial treatment of molar pregnancies.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only major contraindication to D&amp;C is a viable and desired intrauterine pregnancy. Bleeding diathesis is a relative contraindication since bleeding may be excessive in such patients. The management of these patients, including temporarily withholding anticoagulants, needs to be decided on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the patient's other physicians. In the presence of acute vaginal, cervical, or pelvic infection, the procedure should be deferred, if possible, until the infection has been treated. One exception is therapeutic D&amp;C to remove infected products of conception. Cervical cancer, if obstructing the endocervical canal, also represents a contraindication as heavy bleeding or perforation may occur. In these patients cervical biopsy would be diagnostic and D&amp;C would be unnecessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>D&amp;C is generally performed under general or regional anesthesia; therefore, the patient should limit oral intake prior to the procedure. The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends no intake of clear liquids in the two hours before and no solid food in the six hours before procedures involving anesthesia (eight hours in pregnant women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An empty stomach is also desirable for patients who plan paracervical block anesthesia in case the block is inadequate and another anesthetic or sedative needs to be administered.</p><p>Prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary.</p><p>Preoperative laboratory tests are generally not necessary, except as indicated by the patient's age and medical condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;, section on 'Laboratory evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General, regional, or paracervical block anesthesia can be used. The type of anesthesia chosen depends upon the indication for the procedure, as well as the medical history of the patient. General anesthesia provides complete muscular relaxation, which is important when examination under anesthesia is a critical element of the procedure. Regional anesthesia provides adequate muscular blockade without the pulmonary and gastrointestinal risks of general anesthesia.</p><p>Paracervical block with intravenous conscious sedation is a convenient, inexpensive, and effective technique amenable to the outpatient setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69403\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69403 \">picture 1</a>). The block anesthetizes uterine nerves as they pass through Frankenhauser's plexus in the cervix. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroprocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chloroprocaine</a> 1 percent (Nesacaine) provides an improved margin of safety over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> because it is rapidly metabolized and theoretically has a lower risk of toxicity if an inadvertent intravascular injection occurs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;, section on 'Paracervical block'</a>.)</p><p>There have been a number of randomized controlled trials comparing the analgesic effects of intrauterine instillation of anesthetics (eg, 3 to 5 mL of 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> or 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mepivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mepivacaine</a>) versus placebo. Although about half of the trials showed that topical anesthesia significantly reduced the patient's perception of pain during an intrauterine procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>], the other half did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">General issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A D&amp;C is performed with the patient in the dorsal lithotomy position. Care must be taken to avoid over-abduction of the hip joint when placing her in stirrups. Furthermore, the lateral aspect of the legs should not rest against the stirrups as this can cause peroneal nerve injury with subsequent foot-drop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-injury-associated-with-pelvic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve injury associated with pelvic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An examination under anesthesia is performed first. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-examination-under-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic examination under anesthesia&quot;</a>.) The size, shape, and position of the uterus are noted, with particular attention to the axis of the cervix and flexion of the fundus. Appreciation of the latter is critical to reduce the incidence of uterine perforation. The size, shape, and consistency of the adnexa are determined next.</p><p>After the examination, the perineum, vulva, vagina, and cervix are cleansed with an aseptic solution and drapes are placed; it is not necessary to shave either vulvar or lower abdominal hair.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal retractors or a speculum is inserted into the vagina to provide exposure. The type of vaginal retraction required for adequate exposure depends upon the woman's body habitus and the procedure being performed. The Graves speculum provides adequate exposure of the cervix and is well-suited for women undergoing a therapeutic D&amp;C or dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E).</p><p>When a hysteroscopy is being performed in conjunction with the D&amp;C, a side-open Graves speculum provides excellent range of motion for the hysteroscope during the examination and can be easily removed if additional range of motion is required. Alternatively, a Sims retractor or an Auvard weighted speculum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58171\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58171 \">figure 1</a>) can be used in conjunction with Schieden vaginal side wall retractors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68514\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68514 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Tenaculum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A tenaculum is generally used to grasp the anterior lip of the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77725\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77725 \">picture 3</a>). The single tooth tenaculum is useful in women with a small amount of cervical tissue (eg, postmenopausal women, women who have undergone previous cone biopsy); however, this instrument is more likely to cause a laceration of the cervix. We prefer the Bierer (multi-toothed) tenaculum because it is less traumatic. Ring forceps may also be used to grasp the cervix, particularly in the pregnant patient in whom the soft, engorged cervix is prone to laceration and hemorrhage. In some patients, such as women with a lacerated anterior lip, it will be necessary to attach the tenaculum to the posterior cervical lip.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocervical curettage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If indicated, an endocervical curettage (ECC) is performed before dilation of the cervix to avoid contamination of the histologic specimen with endometrial cells. A Kevorkian-Younge curette is introduced into the cervical canal up to the internal os (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62722 \">picture 4</a>). This instrument is slightly curved and narrow to accommodate the small endocervical canal. All four quadrants of the canal are scraped and the specimen placed on a pad (eg, Telfa).</p><p>The ECC is performed to detect the presence of endometrial carcinoma extending into the cervical canal or the presence of endocervical pathology. The clinical usefulness of the ECC has been questioned. It is predictive of cervical involvement of endometrial carcinoma when the histology demonstrates stromal involvement. However, numerous investigators have demonstrated a false-positive rate of 80 percent when tumor is detected on ECC alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Since surgical staging of endometrial carcinoma does not require a separate ECC, the need for an ECC is only relevant for patients who cannot undergo a full staging procedure. If there is a clinical indication for D&amp;C at the time of a cervical conization, the conization should be performed prior to the D&amp;C to avoid contaminating the cervical specimen with endometrial cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Sounding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traction is applied to the tenaculum to align the axis of the cervix and the uterine canal. The uterus is sounded to document the size of the uterus and to confirm the uterine position. The sound is held between the thumb and the index finger to avoid application of excessive pressure. In some cases, dilation of the cervix may be required before sounding the uterus. A normal uterus sounds to approximately 8 to 9 cm.</p><p>The pregnant uterus, however, should <strong>never</strong> be sounded because of the high risk for uterine perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine perforation during gynecologic procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After sounding the uterus, the cervix is dilated. The most common dilators are the Pratt and Hegar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55448\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55448 \">picture 5</a>). The Pratt dilator comes in sizes ranging from 13 to 43 French; each French unit is equivalent to 0.33 mm in diameter. It is characterized by a gradual taper at the end of the instrument. By comparison, Hegar dilators have a blunt end and come in sizes ranging from 1 to 26 mm in diameter. We prefer the tapered end of the Pratt dilator to the Hegar dilator. The former has been shown to require less force for dilation and is less likely to cause a perforation of the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The dilator is grasped in the middle of the instrument with the thumb and index finger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77607\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77607 \">figure 2</a>). The cervix is gradually dilated beginning with the #13 French Pratt dilator. The dilator should be inserted through the internal os, without entering the uterine cavity excessively. This is helpful in preventing uterine perforation and avoids damage to the endometrium, which obscures optimal visualization if hysteroscopic examination is also planned.</p><p>The degree of cervical dilation is dependent upon the indication for the procedure. When diagnostic hysteroscopy and D&amp;C are performed, the dilation is conducted to a point at which the hysteroscope may be comfortably inserted. The #17 French Pratt dilator will easily accommodate a 5 mm hysteroscope or a #3 sharp curette. In general, it is reasonable to dilate the cervix to the outer diameter of the largest instrument that is to be used for a given procedure. If this does not allow for insertion of the instrument, then the cervix can be dilated one size larger followed by a second attempt at inserting the instrument. </p><p>When products of conception are to be removed, the cervix is generally dilated to a diameter in millimeters equal to the gestational age of the uterus. Dilation is easily accomplished up to 9 mm, at which time the cervix may become difficult to dilate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. When cervical dilation beyond 9 mm is required (eg, second trimester pregnancy termination or operative hysteroscopy), osmotic dilators should be placed preoperatively to allow gradual, atraumatic cervical dilation to occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;, section on 'Osmotic dilators'</a>.)</p><p>Cervical ripening agents (prostaglandins) may facilitate dilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hysteroscopy#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hysteroscopy&quot;, section on 'Cervical preparation and dilation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Complicated cases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A stenotic cervical os is often present in postmenopausal patients and sometimes in women who have had previous cervical surgery. Stenosis increases the risk of both cervical laceration and uterine perforation; therefore, these women are best dilated beginning with a series of small (1 to 4 mm) Hegar dilators.</p><p>Having multiple types of cervical dilators available enables the surgeon to find the optimal instrument to approach each specific clinical scenario. Tiny metal lacrimal duct probes are useful for identifying the cervical canal in women with severe stenosis. Also, if the os is tightly scarred, penetration of the external dimple with a number 11 scalpel blade facilitates much easier passage of dilators without undue force. Care must be taken to excise on the external dimple and not incise further into cervical tissue. Tapered Teflon dilators permit gradual and gentle dilation of a stenotic cervical canal. The instrument should be inserted far enough to reach the full diameter at the internal os, but no further. Deep insertion of dilators presents a significant risk for perforation at the fundus, especially in a patient who is pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding patient. If dilators do not pass with gentle pressure, the surgeon should stop and reassess the uterine position, the amount of cervical traction, and the direction of insertion.</p><p>Transabdominal ultrasound can be useful to guide a difficult dilation and may be prudent in women with a previous perforation of the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This technique is especially useful in completing a D&amp;C if a perforation is suspected or if there is a question as to the adequacy of the evacuation. Rarely, it may be necessary to perform a conization to open the cervical canal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Curettage</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Curettes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metal curettes are available in blunt and sharp styles, ranging in size from #1 to #6, with 1 being the smallest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68468\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68468 \">picture 6</a>). The curette is malleable, which allows the instrument to be bent slightly to conform to the ante- or retro-flexed uterus.</p><p>Sharp curettes are typically used for gynecologic procedures, including first trimester pregnancy termination. The blunt curette is best suited for the removal of small fragments of retained products of conception in the second trimester and for the term postpartum uterus, and is often used after suction curettage. The blunt edge prevents excessive removal of the basalis layer of the endometrium, which can occur in the soft postpartum uterus and lead to formation of intrauterine adhesions. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Intrauterine adhesions'</a> below.)</p><p>Plastic suction curettes are used for initial removal of products of conception from the uterus. Some surgeons also prefer the suction curette for diagnostic curettage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Suction curettes range in size from 2 to 16 mm in diameter. Curettes &le;6 mm are flexible while the larger curettes are rigid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69749\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69749 \">picture 7</a>). We prefer 6 to 8 mm curettes when performing suction curettage in a small uterus (less than 8 week size). When a larger rigid suction curette is used, the curved instrument provides better tactile sensation compared to the straight curette.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Sharp curettage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Curettage is performed systematically beginning at the fundus. Even pressure is applied to the endometrial surface along the entire length of the uterus from the fundus to the internal cervical os (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56727 \">figure 3</a>). The endometrial tissue is deposited on a Telfa pad, which should be placed in the vagina to catch any spillage. The entire surface of the endometrium is sampled by moving around the uterus in a consistent and systematic fashion.</p><p>The curettage procedure is completed when &quot;uterine cry&quot; (grittiness to palpation) is appreciated on all surfaces of the uterus. The size and shape of any submucous fibroids detected by tactile sensation should be noted as part of the operative note. Curettage followed by blind extraction with Randall polyp forceps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62722 \">picture 4</a>) improves the rate of detection of polyps over curettage alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A study evaluating the surface area sampled in 50 patients undergoing prehysterectomy D&amp;C found that less than one-fourth of the cavity had been curetted in 16 percent of specimens; less than one-half of the cavity had been curetted in 60 percent; and less than three-quarters of the cavity had been effectively curetted in 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Despite these limitations, D&amp;C provides adequate sensitivity for detecting endometrial pathology because pathologic conditions usually cover a large proportion of the surface area of the endometrial cavity and are therefore detectable by sampling techniques. Focal pathologic processes may, however, go undetected by any blind procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Suction curettage</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic &mdash; Suction curettage may be used for diagnostic purposes. The preferred method uses the Pipelle device and is performed as an office procedure, usually without anesthesia or cervical dilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-sampling-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial sampling procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The external cervical os is then checked for any evidence for excessive bleeding. The tenaculum is removed and the cervix is examined for any trauma. Bleeding from the tenaculum site generally responds to direct pressure or the application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a> solution (Monsel's solution). Occasionally a suture or cautery is required.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant uterus &mdash; Suction curettage is typically used for the evacuation of products of conception, such as for incomplete or missed spontaneous abortion or for early pregnancy termination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester medication abortion (termination of pregnancy)&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p>Large bore plastic cannulas (12 to 16 mm) are used for second trimester pregnancy termination or removal of retained placental <span class=\"nowrap\">fragments/membranes</span> postpartum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of second-trimester pregnancy termination&quot;</a>.) These cannulas should not be inserted deeply into the pregnant or postpartum uterus due to the risk of perforation. Placing a hand on the fundus of the uterus during the procedure may help to decrease the risk of perforation when the uterus is large and assists with assessment of the changing uterine size and position. For the same reason, it is preferable to explore the uterus with a large curette instead of narrower instruments, such as forceps or a small suction cannula. Transabdominal ultrasound guidance is also an option in this setting, but does require assistance from another provider or sonographer.</p><p>The cannula is rotated 360 degrees around its long axis under vacuum pressures of 50 to 60 cm Hg. As tissue is evacuated, the uterus will contract and the suction curette may be advanced to the fundus. Rotation is continued until no more tissue is drawn into the cannula. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxytocin</a> is usually begun as soon as the suction curettage is started and continued for one or more hours postoperatively. A few passes with a large blunt curette (eg, banjo curette) can be performed after the suction procedure to remove any remaining products of conception.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia &mdash; There are additional technical aspects of curettage in this setting.

Perforation is most common when attempting control of postpartum hemorrhage (5.1 percent), and is less frequent during diagnostic curettage (0.3 percent in the premenopausal patient and 2.6 percent in the postmenopausal patient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The risk of perforation is increased in pregnancy due to softening of the uterine wall and the increased size of the endometrial cavity.</p><p>Uterine perforation is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine perforation during gynecologic procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical injuries can arise as a direct result of dilation or from trauma during curettage. Cervical lacerations frequently occur when excessive traction is applied to the tenaculum. The single tooth tenaculum is particularly vulnerable to such injuries; therefore, we prefer the Bierer tenaculum.</p><p>Lacerations can be managed with direct pressure, application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a> solution, cautery, or, in severe cases, suture control. Lacerations that involve the cervical branch of the uterine artery can produce extensive hemorrhage that may be controlled with direct suture application, by placing hemostatic sutures at the internal os, or therapeutic embolization. Rarely, hysterectomy is required to control bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interventional radiology in management of gynecological disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of cervical injury can be reduced by avoiding use of excessive force during dilation. The Pratt dilators generally require less force to insert into the cervix than Hegar dilators. Osmotic dilators are helpful in decreasing the force required to dilate the cervix and are useful when dilation of 9 mm or greater are anticipated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;, section on 'Osmotic dilators'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection after dilation and curettage is rare. Although bacteremia has been demonstrated after 5 percent of D&amp;Cs, the incidence of septicemia is very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Very little is known about risk factors for infection in patients undergoing D&amp;C for diagnostic purposes. In one study, the use of a rigid versus flexible cannula, general versus local anesthesia, and resident versus attending physician were all associated with an increased risk of febrile morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>No data support the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in diagnostic D&amp;C, nor is subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) prophylaxis recommended for a routine diagnostic D&amp;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrauterine adhesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 90 percent of cases of severe intrauterine adhesive disease are related to curettage for pregnancy complications, such as missed or incomplete abortion, postpartum hemorrhage, or retained placental remnants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-adhesions-clinical-manifestation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine adhesions: Clinical manifestation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Trophoblastic embolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rare complication of D&amp;C of a molar pregnancy is embolization of trophoblastic tissue into the systemic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Fatalities from cardiovascular collapse due to trophoblastic embolization have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dilation-and-curettage/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thyroid storm is also encountered rarely. For these reasons, D&amp;C for trophoblastic disease should be performed in a formal operating room, with full anesthesia support and patient monitoring available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may resume normal activities as soon as the effects of anesthesia have worn off and they are comfortable.</p><p>Cramps are the most common side effect.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If use of a large curette is planned, osmotic, rather than mechanical, cervical dilators are recommended for cervical dilation greater than 9 mm. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Cervical dilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sounding the pregnant uterus is not recommended because of the high risk of uterine perforation. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Sounding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, suction and blunt curettes are recommended for use in the pregnant or postpartum uterus as they are less likely to cause uterine perforation or intrauterine adhesions. Traditionally, sharp curettes are used in nonpregnant women, but suction or blunt curettes are also acceptable. Endometrial pathology usually covers a large proportion of the surface area of the endometrial cavity and is therefore detectable by any of these sampling techniques, which have not been directly compared in randomized trials. Focal pathologic processes may, however, go undetected by any blind procedure. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Curettage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perforation of the fundus of the uterus is the most common immediate complication. It should be suspected when there is a loss of resistance during instrumentation of the uterus, when an instrument is found to extend into the uterine cavity for a distance that is greater than the known depth of the uterus, or, obviously, if heavy bleeding or viscera are observed in the vagina. Laparoscopy or laparotomy is often necessary to look for and repair visceral or vascular injuries and to allow completion of the procedure under direct vision. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Uterine perforation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The blunt curette is recommended for use in the pregnant and postpartum uterus. The blunt edge prevents excessive removal of the basalis layer of the endometrium, which can lead to formation of intrauterine adhesions.
