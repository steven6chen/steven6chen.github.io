Pacing permits more aggressive beta blocker therapy for HF, which is often limited by symptomatic bradycardia. Dual chamber pacing allows optimization of the AV interval, thereby improving coordination between atria and ventricles, optimizing valve closure, and minimizing mitral regurgitation (MR). (See <a href=\"#H469927822\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of MR and AV delay optimization'</a> below.) In addition, atrial pacing has been reported to reduce the frequency of atrial fibrillation in some studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of pacemakers in the prevention of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A potential benefit of dual-chamber pacing was suggested in an initial uncontrolled study of 17 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who had medically refractory HF and severe symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These findings provided the rationale for performing a randomized trial, DAVID, which did not confirm any benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h4\">DAVID trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The DAVID trial found that dual chamber (right atrial and right ventricular) pacing was detrimental in patients with HF with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Though the trial found that rate-responsive dual-chamber (DDDR) pacing increased HF admissions and mortality compared to sinus rhythm, it is likely that the RV component of dual chamber pacing was primarily responsible for the detrimental effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The DAVID trial was designed to test the hypothesis that dual-chamber pacing would improve outcomes in HF patients who did not otherwise meet standard criteria for pacing (eg, sick sinus syndrome or conduction abnormalities). The trial enrolled 506 patients with an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) &le;40 percent and an indication for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation but no indication for antibradycardia pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The patients were randomly assigned to VVI pacing with a lower rate limit of 40 beats per minute (VVI-40) or to DDDR pacing with a lower rate limit of 70 beats per minute (DDDR-70) &#160; </p><p>Although the threshold LVEF in the DAVID trial was &le;40 percent, the mean for the population was only 27 percent. Despite the low mean LVEF, approximately 50 percent of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I and only 12 percent were in class III-IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The frequency of RV pacing was substantially higher in the DDDR-70 compared to the VVI-40 group (60 versus 1 percent). Thus, this was effectively a trial comparing DDDR pacing with sinus rhythm.</p><p>At one-year follow-up, there was an unexpected <strong>detrimental</strong> effect of DDDR-70 pacing. Survival free of the primary composite end point of death or hospitalization for HF was significantly lower in the DDDR-70 group (73 versus 84 percent with VVI-40 group). There were non-statistically significant increased rates of both components of the primary end point in the DDDR-70 group: mortality (10.1 versus 6.4 percent) and HF hospitalization (22.6 versus 13.3 percent). </p><p>In a post-hoc analysis from the DAVID trial, the detrimental effects of DDDR-70 pacing were more prominent in patients with a baseline QRS &ge;110 msec [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with baseline QRS prolongation were more likely than those with a normal QRS to have other markers of poor outcome (eg, worse systolic function and a history of HF). Thus, it is not clear if baseline conduction abnormalities themselves or associated cardiac abnormalities predisposed patients to intolerance of RV pacing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">MOST trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Support for the deleterious effect of RV pacing was provided by a post-hoc analysis of data from the MOST trial of pacing modes in patients with sinus node dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Of the 2010 patients enrolled in the MOST trial, this analysis was restricted to the 1339 participants who had a baseline QRS duration &lt;120 msec. Among these patients, 707 were assigned to DDDR and 632 to VVIR pacing. Regardless of pacing mode, patients with a higher cumulative percentage of ventricular paced beats had significantly higher rates of subsequent HF hospitalization and atrial fibrillation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469927822\"><span class=\"h4\">Treatment of MR and AV delay optimization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several small studies have evaluated the impact of dual chamber pacing with optimal AV delay on hemodynamic and clinical parameters in patients with significant MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Although some studies suggest that AV delay optimization can reduce MR, an impact on clinical outcomes has not been established.</p><p>Initial observational series provided conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. More promising results were generated from a prospective series of 20 patients with symptomatic complete AV block and dual chamber pacemakers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Optimal AV delay was determined by echocardiographic parameters. The mean optimal AV delay was 98 msec, which reduced the severity of MR. Additionally, the cardiac output and systolic blood pressure improved.</p><p>Further insight into the impact of dual chamber pacing with optimized AV delay came from a small randomized trial. This study enrolled 38 patients in sinus rhythm with HF and randomly assigned them to optimal medical therapy or optimal medical therapy with dual chamber pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. AV delay was optimized according to echocardiographic parameters and generally ranged between 100 to 120 msec (in 14 of 19 patients). There was no difference between the two arms in most clinical end points, although the degree of MR and systolic LV diameter were both reduced in patients assigned to dual chamber pacing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469927736\"><span class=\"h3\">Pacing modes to avoid or limit RV pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the results of the DAVID trial and the post-hoc analysis of the MOST trial, later randomized trials studied pacing modes selected to avoid or limit RV pacing. These modes that avoided or limited RV pacing led to outcomes similar to those with back-up ventricular pacing.</p><p>The DAVID II trial found that atrial pacing and back-up ventricular pacing produced similar rates of event-free survival and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The trial randomly assigned 600 patients with LVEF &le;40 percent and an indication for ICD implantation but no indication for antibradycardia pacing to atrial pacing at 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> or minimal ventricular pacing at 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. The primary combined end point of time to HF hospitalization or death was similar in the two treatment groups with overall incidence of 11.1, 16.9, and 24.6 percent at one, two, and three years, respectively. The incidence of atrial fibrillation, syncope, appropriate or inappropriate shocks, and quality-of-life measures were similar in the two groups.</p><p>The INTRINSIC RV trial found that dual chamber rate responsive pacing with the AV Search Hysteresis algorithm (DDDR AVSH at 60 to 130 beats per minute) produced similar outcomes as back-up ventricular (VVI at 40 beats per minute) pacing.</p><p>Of note, programming very long AV delay intervals using these features can result in significant bradycardia or pacemaker syndrome in the presence of more advanced or progressive AV block and individualized programming with attention to the patients PR interval is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">BIVENTRICULAR PACING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is performed with a pacemaker that simultaneously paces the right and left ventricles (biventricular pacing). CRT can improve cardiac function, symptoms, and survival in selected patients with HF with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (particularly those with LV ejection fraction [LVEF] &le;35 percent and wide QRS with left bundle branch block). In addition, CRT can improve outcomes in selected patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF &le;35 percent) who require a pacemaker with anticipated requirement for significant (&gt;40 percent) ventricular pacing (thus avoiding the detrimental effects of isolated RV pacing). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are recommended for the primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in selected patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. By reducing the incidence of arrhythmic death, ICDs may result in more patients surviving to advanced stages of heart failure (HF). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ICDs can influence the incidence and progression of HF by two mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contemporary ICDs also function as cardiac pacemakers. As an example, the DAVID trial, discussed above, involved dual chamber ICDs. Thus, the detrimental impact of RV pacing also applies to ICDs. Because many patients with an ICD do not have a standard indication for pacing, efforts to minimize ventricular pacing are particularly important in these patients. The programming and device selection options discussed below are also available in ICDs. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By aborting arrhythmic deaths, ICDs prolong survival in patients with substantial cardiac disease. Such patients may later progress to more advanced HF. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This phenomenon was illustrated in a post-hoc analysis from the MADIT II trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cardiac-pacing-in-heart-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this trial, 1218 patients with a prior myocardial infarction and an LVEF &le;30 percent were randomly assigned to ICD implantation or conventional medical therapy. The patients assigned to ICD therapy had a significant reduction in mortality. At a mean follow-up of 20 months, patients assigned to an ICD were significantly more likely to be hospitalized for HF than those assigned to conventional therapy (23 versus 17 percent). Among patients assigned to ICD therapy, the incidence of HF was significantly greater after appropriate ICD therapy compared to before such therapy (23 versus 16 events per 100 person years). Both the incidence of initial HF admissions and the intensity of recurrent admissions increased after appropriate ICD therapies. In contrast, there was no change in the incidence of HF after inappropriate device therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy#H362963668\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'MADIT-II trial'</a>.)</p><p/><p>These data suggest that appropriate ICD therapies are more common in patients who have or will soon experience worsening HF. Thus, life-prolonging ICD therapies may transform SCD risk to subsequent HF risk, although short-term mortality is improved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452358632\"><span class=\"h2\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who do not have a standard indication (eg, sick sinus syndrome or atrioventricular [AV] block), single (eg, right ventricular [RV] demand pacing [VVI] or right atrial demand pacing [AAI]) or dual chamber (eg, DDD or DDI) cardiac pacing is not indicated for the purpose of treating heart failure (HF). In contrast, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with biventricular pacing is indicated for selected HF patients and for some patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction at risk for HF.

Options include the following (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Device selection and programming'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Managed ventricular pacing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Standard devices programmed to minimize RV pacing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Biventricular pacing when indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy are present.
