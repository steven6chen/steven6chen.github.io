Infants born vaginally to infected mothers with genital disease are at risk for acquiring <em>C. trachomatis</em>, which usually presents as conjunctivitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pneumonia.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of <em>C. trachomatis</em> conjunctivitis and pneumonia in the newborn and young infant are reviewed here.</p><p>Pneumonia in older children, other disorders caused by <em>Chlamydia</em>, and the possible role of infection in preterm delivery are discussed elsewhere.

There are case reports documenting chlamydial infection in infants born after cesarean delivery with ruptured membranes and, more rarely, intact membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. The latter condition indicates either a transmembrane or a transplacental transmission of the infection.</p><p>There are 15 serovariants of <em>C. trachomatis</em>. Neonatal infection is usually caused by <em>C. trachomatis</em> serovariants D through K, which are the primary serotypes causing genital disease in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence in pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following is a brief review of the prevalence of <em>C. trachomatis</em> in pregnant women. The prevalence and risk factors for <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection in women in the general population are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of <em>C. trachomatis</em> in pregnant women ranges from 2 to 20 percent depending on the population screened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Similar to the increased prevalence of <em>C. trachomatis</em> in adolescent and young adult women in the general population, the highest prevalence rate in pregnancy occurs in adolescent and young adult women. This was illustrated in a British study that screened 1216 pregnant women for <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection by testing for the presence of the organism by ligase chain reaction from self-administered vaginal swab or first-pass urine specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The overall prevalence of infection was 2.4 percent. In women less than 25 years of age and adolescents, the prevalence increased to 8.6 and 14.3 percent, respectively. In another study of 203 pregnant adolescents from the United States, 18 percent had <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection in the third trimester of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Although not specifically studied in pregnant women, other risk factors for <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection in sexually active women include multiple sex partners, non-use of barrier contraceptives, concurrent or prior sexually transmitted disease, and anatomic factors (eg, cervical friability or cervical ectopy). Presumably, these risk factors for <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection seen in the general population are also likely to be risk factors for infection in pregnant women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of acquiring <em>C. trachomatis</em> in an infant born vaginally to a woman with chlamydial cervicitis is approximately 50 percent but has been reported to be as high as 60 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/7,8,11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,11-17</a>]. However, this estimation includes newborns with asymptomatic infection of the nasopharynx or only serologic evidence of infection. The rate of symptomatic chlamydial infection in infants born to <em>C. trachomatis</em>-infected mothers is lower. Based upon positive cultures for <em>C. trachomatis</em> in symptomatic infants, the risk for neonatal-acquired conjunctivitis is between 20 and 50 percent, and for pneumonia between 5 and 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/6,11-13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11-13,16,17</a>].</p><p>The discrepancy of transmission rate based upon detection methods and location of screening in at-risk infants is best illustrated by a prospective study of 5531 pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Positive cervical cultures for <em>C. trachomatis</em> were detected in 262 women (4.7 percent) and 131 of their infants were followed prospectively. Sixty percent of these infants demonstrated positive serology for <em>C. trachomatis</em> and in 36 percent of infants, the organism was isolated from cultures of the nasopharynx, conjunctivae, rectum, and vagina. Culture-positive conjunctivitis was diagnosed in 23 of these 131 infants (18 percent) and pneumonia in 21 (16 percent). Rectal and vaginal colonization was demonstrated in 14 percent.</p><p>In a decision analysis evaluating prophylactic treatment for infants exposed to maternal chlamydial infection, a review of the literature estimated the prevalence of conjunctivitis and pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In 13 studies published from 1977 to 1994, 156 of 1055 infants (15 percent) exposed to maternal chlamydial infection developed conjunctivitis. In 10 studies, 42 of 507 infants (7 percent) exposed to maternal infection developed pneumonia. These results are limited by the inclusion of observed case series with prospective cohort studies.</p><p>While vaginal birth carries the highest risk of transmission, there is a small risk of acquiring infections in infants born by cesarean delivery both with premature rupture of membranes and intact membranes. In one study of 141 exposed infants, for example, <em>C. trachomatis</em> was isolated from 58 of 125 infants delivered vaginally, 2 of 10 delivered by cesarean delivery with rupture of membranes, and 1 of 6 delivered by cesarean delivery without rupture of membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Conjunctivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequent clinical manifestation of <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection in the newborn is conjunctivitis. The condition is sometimes referred to as inclusion conjunctivitis of the newborn (ICN) or inclusion blennorrhea.</p><p>The incubation period for <em>C. trachomatis</em> conjunctivitis is 5 to 14 days after delivery. Presentation before five days is unusual, but has been reported to occur earlier in infants born to mothers with premature rupture of the membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Clinical findings of conjunctivitis range from mild swelling with a watery eye discharge, which becomes mucopurulent, to marked swelling of the eyelids with red and thickened conjunctivae (chemosis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74760\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74760 \">picture 1</a>). A pseudomembrane may form as the exudate adheres to conjunctiva. The conjunctivae may also be very friable, resulting in bloody discharge. In a retrospective study of 90 infants from Hong Kong with conjunctivitis, blood-stained eye discharge was found to have high specificity and positive predictive value for chlamydial conjunctivitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A membrane of granulation tissue (micropannus) may form, especially if the patient is untreated for more than two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Treatment of conjunctivitis usually results in healing without complications. However, untreated infection may persist for months and cause corneal and conjunctival scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among infants born to mothers with cervical <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection, 5 to 30 percent develop pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/11-13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13,16,17</a>]. Approximately one-half of these infants have a history of conjunctivitis.</p><p>Pneumonia due to <em>C. trachomatis</em> is recognized in most affected infants between 4 and 12 weeks of age, although essentially all are symptomatic before 8 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Some infants may have upper respiratory tract symptoms as early as two weeks of age. Cough and nasal congestion without significant discharge are common, although occasional infants may have thick nasal secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Otitis media may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Characteristic features are a staccato cough that may occur in paroxysms, and tachypnea, although these are not universally present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rales are often present on auscultation of the lungs; however, wheezing is uncommon. The liver and spleen may be easily palpable because of the hyperinflated lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Preterm infants may have apneic spells associated with the infection. <em>C. trachomatis</em> has been isolated from tracheal secretions of preterm infants with pneumonia diagnosed in the first week after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

In addition, there are several nonculture methods, such as nucleic acid amplification tests. While these nonculture techniques have a high sensitivity and specificity when compared with culture, there are insufficient data in newborns to replace culture as a primary means of diagnosis. Nevertheless, these tests may be useful when a rapid diagnosis is desirable, as the turnaround time for results can be considerably shorter than those for culture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. trachomatis</em> should be suspected in an infant less than one month of age with conjunctivitis if there is the possibility of exposure to the organism, specifically if the mother has a history of untreated <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection, or no prenatal care. If there has been no prenatal care or a maternal history of <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> (<em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>), the exudate also should be examined with Gram stain and cultured using selective medium to detect <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonococcal-infection-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gonococcal infection in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection should be considered in an infant less than three months of age with pneumonia if the mother has history of untreated infection or no prenatal care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Specimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborns suspected of chlamydial infection should have both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal samples taken.</p><p>Conjunctival specimens for <em>C. trachomatis</em> testing should be obtained from the everted eyelid using aluminum shafted Dacron-tipped swab or a swab specified by the manufacturer's test kit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The specimens must include conjunctival epithelial cells because <em>C. trachomatis </em>is an obligate intracellular organism. Exudates are not adequate for testing. Other swabs, such as wood shafts or tips with calcium alginate are <strong>not</strong> recommended, as they inhibit the growth of the organism.</p><p>In infants with pneumonia, testing for <em>C. trachomatis</em> should be performed on specimens obtained from the nasopharynx. Tracheal aspirates can be sent in patients who are intubated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic methods</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Culture of the organism is the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosing neonatal <em>C. trachomatis </em>conjunctivitis and pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The specificity and sensitivity of culture is nearly 100 percent with adequate sampling, appropriate transport, and a skilled laboratory staff.</p><p>Specimens for <em>C. trachomatis</em> testing should be obtained using an aluminum shafted Dacron-tipped swab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. The specimen should be transported immediately at 2 to 8&ordm;C and processed within 24 hours. If processing is delayed, the specimen should be kept at -70&ordm;C. Storage at -20&ordm;C or in frost-free freezers kills the organism and is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. The sample is inoculated into tissue culture. After 48 to 72 hours, positive confirmation of <em>C. trachomatis</em> is made by microscopic identification using a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluorescein</a> conjugated, species-specific monoclonal antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/18,29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,29,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Nucleic acid amplification tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) methodology consists of amplifying <em>C. trachomatis</em> DNA or RNA sequences. Studies have found that NAATs have high sensitivity and specificity compared with culture, especially in the diagnosis of genital infections in sexually active women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. There are several commercially available NAAT assays for detection of <em>C. trachomatis</em> that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, none are approved for use in conjunctival or nasopharyngeal specimens from infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, there are supportive data showing the efficacy of these tests. Results of one study published in 1997 and one published in 2008 suggested that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed very well compared with culture for detection of <em>C. trachomatis</em> in conjunctival specimens from infants with conjunctivitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34</a>]. Infants with <em>C. trachomatis</em> conjunctivitis usually have very high numbers of organisms present, and it is easy to obtain an adequate specimen. As a result, it is not unreasonable to expect that the available NAATs will perform well for the diagnosis of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis, similar to the performance of antigen detection methods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Antigen detection methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These methods include direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) tests. Sensitivity and specificity with conjunctival specimens is high. Many of the earlier antigen detection tests, including DFA staining and EIAs performed well with conjunctival specimens, with sensitivities and specificities of 97 to 98 percent. Performance was not as robust with nasopharyngeal specimens, probably reflecting the lower number of organisms observed in nasopharyngeal versus conjunctival specimens.</p><p>The FDA has approved antigen detection methods for the diagnosis of neonatal conjunctivitis and pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. There are only two commercially available antigen detection tests in the United States (Pathfinder Chlamydia DFA and EIA Microplate). These tests have largely been replaced by NAATs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of <em>C trachomatis </em>pneumonia can be made by serum antibody determination using the microimmunofluorescence (MIF) method. A serum titer of <em>C. trachomatis</em>-specific immunoglobulin M of &ge;1:32 is considered diagnostic of neonatal trachomatis pneumonia. Serum antibody testing is <strong>not</strong> reliable for conjunctivitis. However, this test is not FDA approved, is difficult to perform, and is not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial treatment for chlamydial conjunctivitis should be based upon a positive diagnostic test.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common clinical manifestation of neonatal <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection is conjunctivitis, which usually presents between 5 and 14 days of life. Symptoms range from mild swelling with a watery eye discharge, which becomes mucopurulent, to marked swelling of the eyelids with red and thickened conjunctivae (chemosis). Untreated infants may have persistent conjunctivitis for months that may result in corneal and conjunctival scarring. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Conjunctivitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal <em>C. trachomatis</em> pneumonia presents between 4 and 12 weeks of age, although most infants are symptomatic before eight weeks. Patients are usually afebrile or have minimal fever with a staccato cough. Many infants also have conjunctivitis. Apnea may be seen in infected preterm infants. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosis of neonatal <em>C. trachomatis</em> is culture. Nucleic acid amplification tests are non-culture diagnostic tools with a high sensitivity and specificity compared with culture. However, there are insufficient data for these tests to replace culture as a primary means of diagnosis in newborns. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial treatment for chlamydial conjunctivitis should be based upon a positive diagnostic test. By contrast, initial therapy for chlamydial pneumonia should be initiated on a presumptive diagnosis, based upon clinical and radiographic findings, until diagnostic tests results are available. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There have been few studies examining the optimal treatment for <em>C. trachomatis</em> in the newborn; the greatest amount of clinical experience is with macrolides, in particular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">erythromycin</a>. For treatment of neonatal <em>C. trachomatis </em>conjunctivitis, we recommend a course of oral rather than topical erythromycin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Topical therapy is ineffective and not necessary if a patient is treated systemically. For treatment of neonatal <em>C. trachomatis </em>pneumonia, we suggest oral erythromycin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A typical dose of erythromycin is 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day given orally in four divided doses for 14 days. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Azithromycin</a> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> given orally once daily for a three-day course) may be used as an alternative to erythromycin. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most effective way to prevent perinatal chlamydial infection is through a systematic program that identifies and treats all pregnant women with genital <em>C. trachomatis </em>infection. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recommended topical therapies for prevention of neonatal gonococcal conjunctivitis are not effective for preventing chlamydial conjunctivitis. Because of the relatively low risk of clinically significant disease in infants born to mothers with active chlamydial infection, and the potential risk of pyloric stenosis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">erythromycin</a> therapy, we recommend <strong>not</strong> administering oral prophylactic antibiotics to asymptomatic infants exposed to maternal <em>C. trachomatis</em> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).
