For example, in the case of RYGB, an endoscope advanced through the &quot;anatomic route&quot; must traverse the esophagus, gastric pouch, and Roux limb (typically 100 to 150 cm in length), and then navigate the acute angle at the jejunojejunostomy into the biliopancreatic limb up to the papilla (an additional 80 to 100 cm). Moreover, in cases with a native papilla, the endoscopist is then faced with the challenge of cannulating the bile duct or pancreatic duct while approaching the papilla from a reverse position. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-after-billroth-ii-reconstruction#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) after Billroth II reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Cannulating the papilla from the reverse position'</a>.)</p><p>To overcome these problems, non-standard approaches, innovative techniques, and specialized accessories have been developed to perform ERCP in patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy.

Specifically, the endoscopist should obtain details about the anatomic resection, the type of reconstruction, the length of the limbs, the types of anastomoses (eg, end-to-side versus side-to-side), and the presence or absence of a native papilla. In addition, all relevant postoperative imaging studies should be reviewed, especially magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) studies, if available. </p><p>As a final consideration, it is important to be aware of the time interval following surgery. In the early postoperative period, it is important to weigh the risks of instrumentation with regards to anastomotic disruption against the potential benefits of ERCP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850898150\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing the best approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several techniques available to perform ERCP in patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy, each with advantages and disadvantages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F115012\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115012 \">figure 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54031\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54031 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. No single approach has been identified as the best for all patients, so the endoscopist must select the approach on a case-by-case basis, taking the following factors into consideration:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Roux limb length (long versus short)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the patient has a native papilla or a <span class=\"nowrap\">bilio/pancreato-enteric</span> anastomosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indication for ERCP, including the likelihood of repeat procedures and the need for therapeutic maneuvers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The availability of local expertise (deep enteroscopy, interventional radiology, surgery)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's surgical risk</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3822821\"><span class=\"h3\">Native papilla</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a native papilla, the endoscopist should select a technique that allows for the use of a duodenoscope. A duodenoscope is preferred because it increases the chance of successful selective cannulation of the bile <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pancreatic duct in patients with a native papilla. Transoral advancement of a duodenoscope through the anatomic route can be attempted in patients with a short Roux limb, although this approach is arduous and frequently unsuccessful. (See <a href=\"#H1850898164\" class=\"local\">'ERCP using standard duodenoscope'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with a long Roux limb and a native papilla, the best option is often ERCP through a gastrostomy or jejunostomy or a laparoscopy-assisted ERCP. If repeated ERCPs are anticipated, access via a gastrostomy tube placed in the excluded stomach is recommended. The gastrostomy tube can be placed percutaneously by interventional radiology in patients who are poor surgical candidates. (See <a href=\"#H1850898206\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approaches'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3822828\"><span class=\"h3\">Bilioenteric or pancreatoenteric anastomosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with bilioenteric and pancreatoenteric anastomoses, forward-viewing endoscopes are adequate for performing ERCP. Enteroscopes or colonoscopes can be used for patients with a short Roux limb, whereas deep enteroscopy techniques such as balloon-assisted enteroscopy or spiral enteroscopy are preferable in patients with a long Roux limb. (See <a href=\"#H1850898171\" class=\"local\">'ERCP using an enteroscope or pediatric colonoscope'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1850898178\" class=\"local\">'ERCP using deep enteroscopy techniques'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850898157\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSORAL APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transoral approaches entail the use of duodenoscopes, pediatric colonoscopes, or enteroscopes advanced per os through the anatomic route. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850898164\"><span class=\"h2\">ERCP using standard duodenoscope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The side-viewing duodenoscope is the ideal endoscope to perform ERCP, particularly for the cannulation of a native papilla. Unfortunately, the duodenoscope-only approach is frequently unsuccessful, as shown in one small series in which ERCP was successfully performed in only 33 percent of Roux-en-Y patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Therefore, we reserve the transoral approach using a standard duodenoscope for patients with a short Roux limb.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850898171\"><span class=\"h2\">ERCP using an enteroscope or pediatric colonoscope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An enteroscope or pediatric colonoscope may be an option for performing an ERCP when using a duodenoscope is not feasible. In one series, 18 patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy (including three Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients) underwent a total of 25 attempted ERCPs using a pediatric colonoscope (164 cm working length) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enteroscope (240 cm working length) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Successful advancement of the endoscope to the level of the papilla or the <span class=\"nowrap\">bilioenteric/pancreatoenteric</span> anastomosis was accomplished in 84 percent of attempted procedures. Biliary cannulation was successful in 94 percent (including five of six procedures performed on patients with intact papillae), and endoscopic treatment was performed in 86 percent.</p><p>A disadvantage of this approach is that the forward-viewing perspective and the lack of an instrument elevator make selective duct cannulation more difficult when addressing an intact papilla. In addition, the maneuverability of the long enteroscope or colonoscope can be very limited due to torsion of the scope shaft and loop formation. Finally, deflection of the scope tip can make the introduction of accessories through the working channel difficult or impossible. To overcome these problems, forward-viewing endoscopes can be used initially to navigate the anatomic route. Once the papilla is reached, a guidewire is placed, over which a duodenoscope is subsequently advanced.</p><p>One study described the use of this technique in a series of 15 patients with long-limb Roux-en-Y anatomy and an intact papilla, 11 of whom had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. On several occasions, a large diameter ERCP stone-extraction balloon was advanced over the wire and inflated in the biliopancreatic limb or bypassed stomach, serving as an anchor as the duodenoscope was passed over the catheter into the region of the papilla. Other maneuvers similar to those used during colonoscopy (straightening loops, changing patient position, and applying manual abdominal pressure) were performed to facilitate duodenoscope advancement. ERCP was ultimately successful in 10 of the 15 patients (67 percent), with the main reason for failure being the inability to pass an endoscope to the region of the papilla. Of note, the five patients in whom ERCP was not possible had all undergone RYGB, underscoring the need for alternative methods to perform successful ERCP in this important patient population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850898178\"><span class=\"h2\">ERCP using deep enteroscopy techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is growing experience with the performance of ERCP using deep enteroscopy techniques, including double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53187\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53187 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50391 \">figure 9</a>), single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63179\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63179 \">figure 10</a>), and spiral enteroscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76104\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76104 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-deep-small-bowel-enteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of deep small bowel enteroscopy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>While deep enteroscopy techniques represent a significant advancement for performing ERCP in patients with surgically altered anatomy, they are not yet widely performed outside of specialized centers. Furthermore, they are fraught with the aforementioned limitations inherent to the use of enteroscopes for ERCP, including restricted maneuverability of the scope (related to looping, adhesions, sharp angulations, and depth of scope insertion), unfavorable orientation of the native papilla, lack of an instrument elevator, and relative paucity of enteroscope-compatible ERCP accessories.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850898185\"><span class=\"h3\">Double balloon enteroscope-assisted ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on data largely from case reports and a few case series, the papilla (or <span class=\"nowrap\">bilioenteric/pancreatoenteric</span> anastomosis) can be reached in over 90 percent of cases, and successful selective duct cannulation can be achieved in over 80 percent of cases using the double balloon enteroscope-assisted ERCP (DB-ERCP) technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>]. </p><p>In one of the first case series describing DB-ERCP in 13 patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], successful bile duct cannulation was achieved in 16 of 18 ERCPs, with therapy being performed in six cases (including stent insertion and removal and stone extraction). Of note, only one of the patients in this series had a native papilla, and ERCP was unsuccessful in this patient due to the inability to approach the papilla at the appropriate angle. </p><p>As with other ERCPs using forward-viewing endoscopes, cannulation of the native papilla may be difficult with DB-ERCP. An additional problem when performing DB-ERCP is that there are a limited number of ERCP accessories that are compatible with a standard double balloon enteroscope due to its length. However, this issue can be overcome with the use of a &quot;short&quot; DBE system that has a 152 cm working length and is compatible with conventional accessories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>]. One study performed 55 ERCPs in 36 Roux-en-Y total gastrectomy patients using the &quot;short&quot; double balloon enteroscope, achieving successful bile duct cannulation in 50 of 55 procedures (91 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A full spectrum of therapeutic maneuvers were performed, including sphincterotomy, stone extraction, balloon dilation, and the insertion of plastic stents, metal stents, and nasobiliary drainage tubes.</p><p>If a &quot;short&quot; double balloon enteroscope is not available, the standard DBE or SBE overtube can be modified to permit the use of a conventional forward-viewing upper endoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>]. Once the papilla is reached, the enteroscope is removed from the overtube, which is left in place with the balloon inflated to maintain its position near the papilla. Next, a 12 mm aperture is created in the overtube at a point 100 cm from its tip on the side opposite the pressure line (so that the balloon remains inflated). A standard upper endoscope can then be inserted through the aperture and advanced down the overtube into position below the papilla. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850898192\"><span class=\"h3\">Single balloon enteroscope-assisted ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Performance of single balloon enteroscope-assisted ERCP (SB-ERCP) in patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy has been associated with diagnostic success rates ranging from 60 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>].

A total of 199 procedures were performed. The rates of successful biliary cannulation were similar for SB-ERCP and ERCP using an adult colonoscope (76 versus 70 percent), whereas SB-ERCP had a higher rate of successful biliary cannulation when compared with ERCP using a pediatric colonoscope (76 versus 59 percent). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in the therapeutic success rates between SB-ERCP and ERCP using an adult colonoscope (71 versus 66 percent), but there was a higher success rate for SB-ERCP when it was compared with ERCP using a pediatric colonoscope (71 versus 54 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850898199\"><span class=\"h3\">Spiral enteroscopy-assisted ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spiral enteroscopy utilizes a rotating overtube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76104\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76104 \">picture 2</a>) that pleats the small bowel onto the overtube and allows deep advancement of an enteroscope. Potential advantages of spiral enteroscopy-assisted ERCP (SE-ERCP) over DB-ERCP or SB-ERCP include relative ease of use, better endoscope control, and perhaps a shorter learning curve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Studies of SE-ERCP in a variety of patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy have reported success rates of 55 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/23-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-29</a>].

In addition, all standard ERCP accessories can be used. </p><p>Surgical approaches include ERCP through a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tract and laparoscopy-assisted ERCP.

This approach requires a great deal of coordination between the surgery and endoscopy teams and is more invasive than purely endoscopic approaches. </p><p>One study including 56 patients compared LA-ERCP with balloon enteroscope-assisted ERCP (BEA-ERCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. LA-ERCP was superior to BEA-ERCP with regard to papilla identification (100 versus 72 percent), cannulation rate (100 versus 59 percent), and therapeutic success (100 versus 59 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1514798497\"><span class=\"h2\">Less common approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a case report, ERCP has been successfully performed via a mature jejunostomy tract in a patient with a history of total gastrectomy, esophagogastrectomy, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Another approach that has been described entails the use of balloon enteroscopy to access the excluded stomach, performance of a direct retrograde percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, followed by deployment of a self-expanding metal sent within the gastrostomy tract. Antegrade ERCP through the stent can then be performed in the same session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850898227\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Performing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy is a challenging, frequently arduous task, but there are now several techniques available to endoscopists. There is no single best technique for all patients, so the approach must be selected on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H1850898143\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a native papilla and a short Roux limb, a transoral approach using a duodenoscope can be attempted, although it is still frequently unsuccessful. (See <a href=\"#H1850898164\" class=\"local\">'ERCP using standard duodenoscope'</a> above.)<br/><br/>If a transoral approach using a duodenoscope is unsuccessful, a colonoscope or enteroscope may be used to perform the ERCP (recognizing the limitations of forward viewing endoscopes and the relative lack of compatible ERCP accessories) or to initially navigate the anatomic route and facilitate guidewire-assisted duodenoscope insertion into the biliopancreatic limb. (See <a href=\"#H1850898171\" class=\"local\">'ERCP using an enteroscope or pediatric colonoscope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a native papilla and a long Roux limb (as in most Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients), deep enteroscopy techniques can be considered. However, ERCP through a gastrostomy or laparoscopy-assisted ERCP are preferable in good surgical candidates. These approaches are preferred because they provide rapid, reliable access to the descending duodenum with visualization of the papilla in the usual orientation for ERCP, and they allow the use of a therapeutic duodenoscope and all standard ERCP accessories. (See <a href=\"#H1850898178\" class=\"local\">'ERCP using deep enteroscopy techniques'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1850898206\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without a native papilla (ie, patients with a <span class=\"nowrap\">bilioenteric/pancreatoenteric</span> anastomosis) and a short Roux limb, a forward-viewing endoscope such as a colonoscope or enteroscope can be used in most cases. (See <a href=\"#H1850898171\" class=\"local\">'ERCP using an enteroscope or pediatric colonoscope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without a native papilla and a long Roux limb, deep enteroscopy techniques (double balloon, single balloon, spiral enteroscopy) should be attempted, if available. Alternatively, ERCP through a gastrostomy or laparoscopy-assisted ERCP can be considered.
