They can be separated into isolated musculoskeletal chest pain syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79217 \">table 1</a>) and systemic disorders, the latter associated with either rheumatic or nonrheumatic diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73531\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73531 \">table 2</a>). The major causes of musculoskeletal chest pain are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major causes of musculoskeletal chest pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Musculoskeletal chest pain must be differentiated from chest pain due to potentially life-threatening disorders such as myocardial ischemia or infarction, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or pneumothorax. The diagnostic approach to a patient with chest pain is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Therapeutic interventions for musculoskeletal disorders affecting the chest are generally similar to those for musculoskeletal pain elsewhere in the body. However, in the case of chest pain, a common patient concern, stated or unstated, is that the pain is due to heart disease, and this concern must be addressed as well. In this regard, the physical examination itself, particularly the examiner's ability to reproduce or exacerbate the chest pain by palpation or with various maneuvers, helps the patient understand the noncardiac nature of the problem. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical evaluation of musculoskeletal chest pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF MUSCULOSKELETAL CHEST PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned in the introduction, there are many local and systemic diseases and disorders that cause musculoskeletal chest pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79217 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73531\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73531 \">table 2</a>). These causes are discussed in more detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major causes of musculoskeletal chest pain in adults&quot;</a>). A brief summary of some selected causes follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Costochondritis and Tietze's syndrome are both associated with tenderness of one or more of the costochondral joints. Although there is some controversy over whether these two disorders are truly distinct, in this discussion the term Tietze's syndrome is used for the combination of pain, tenderness and <strong>swelling</strong>, while costochondritis is used when swelling is absent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sternalis syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by localized tenderness found over the body of the sternum, often with tenderness that causes radiation of pain bilaterally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Xiphoidalgia or xiphodynia is also a rare syndrome with localized pain and tenderness over the xiphoid process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis is a syndrome characterized by a unique arthropathy that frequently involves the anterior chest wall and is associated with a spectrum of neutrophilic skin lesions. The acronym <strong>SAPHO</strong> syndrome has been proposed as a unifying term to include the various features that may occur: <strong>s</strong>ynovitis; <strong>a</strong>cne; <strong>p</strong>ustulosis; <strong>h</strong>yperostosis; and <strong>o</strong>steomyelitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower rib pain syndromes go by many different names such as slipping or clicking rib syndrome, rib-tip syndrome, or twelfth rib. Pain can be diffuse or localized, and is accompanied by tenderness on the costal margin that reproduces the pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibromyalgia is a common chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome that presents with diffuse myalgias, multiple tender points, sleep disturbance, and fatigue. Myofascial pain syndrome is a related disorder associated with focal myalgia and tenderness. Many patients report tenderness over the costochondral junctions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with musculoskeletal chest pain may benefit from one or more of the following interventions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient education and reassurance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical measures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical agents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle relaxants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antidepressants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticonvulsants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local glucocorticoid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anesthetic injections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric evaluation and treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioid analgesics</p><p/><p>The choice of intervention depends upon the cause of the pain (see <a href=\"#H54213453\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of selected conditions'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a musculoskeletal cause for chest pain has been established and immediate life-threatening disorders have been excluded, a careful explanation of the diagnosis and reassurance may be therapeutic for some patients. For them, watchful waiting without any other specific intervention may be appropriate.</p><p>Follow-up and advice are helpful to such patients and may be appropriately scheduled four to six weeks after the first clinical encounter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A follow-up appointment with a doctor in primary care provides an opportunity for further discussion and may identify patients with uncontrolled symptoms who require further evaluation or additional treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overload and overuse, as during weight training, lifting, or pushing heavy objects, may cause muscle strain. If possible, any activity that causes or reliably exacerbates the problem should be reduced <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stopped, at least temporarily. This is particularly important for patients with spontaneous sternoclavicular subluxation. Anecdotal reports of benefit from physical interventions are widespread although not assessed in the scientific literature. For muscle spasm, application of heat may be helpful. If no spasm is present, application of cold may reduce swelling and discomfort.</p><p>Stretching exercises may benefit patients with musculoskeletal chest pain of various causes, particularly if muscle spasm is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The specific exercises should address the muscle groups involved (eg, pectoralis major versus sternal head of the sternocleidomastoid). For certain patients with intractable symptoms, a short course of physical therapy with a goal of an independent home program is worth the investment of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> cream or salicylate-containing creams or gels may be tried with application three to four times daily for a two-week trial period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. These agents are widely available at local pharmacies. Where available, topical NSAID preparations (eg, 1 percent topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> gel or diclofenac patch) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethyl-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethyl chloride</a> spray may also provide some relief and can be used several times per day. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'</a> below.)</p><p>Local pain may also often respond to a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> patch or topical lidocaine gel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonopioid analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with mild symptoms and no evidence of an inflammatory disorder (eg, muscle strain, costochondral tenderness without swelling, etc), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those who have a relative or absolute contraindication to the use of NSAIDs, may benefit from a nonopioid analgesic such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> (up to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in divided doses in adults).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over-the-counter NSAIDs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>) are often used, and may be more effective than simple analgesics for patients with signs of inflammation. Most patients' symptoms due to musculoskeletal chest problems improve over the course of a few weeks or months.</p><p>Patients with uncontrolled symptoms from Tietze's syndrome, SAPHO syndrome, costochondritis, sternalis, xiphoidalgia, or the lower rib pain syndromes may require prescription-strength NSAIDs. If a maximum dose of a particular NSAID does not relieve symptoms or efficacy wanes, anecdotal reports suggest that switching classes of NSAIDs may prove helpful (from an acetic acid to a propionic acid for example) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70067 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Patients should be cautioned that use of NSAIDs may precipitate renal insufficiency, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Those at high risk of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal damage and those requiring concomitant low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy for cardiovascular disease may benefit from ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>). Interference by some NSAIDs with the beneficial antiplatelet effects of aspirin may be a concern for those taking low doses of aspirin for prophylaxis or treatment of cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-in-the-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Use of a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor may also be considered for patients at high risk of gastroduodenal damage and for those receiving anticoagulants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of selective COX-2 inhibitors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;, section on 'Selective COX-2 inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>Intramuscular injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> (15 to 30 mg) followed by oral ketorolac (up to 10 mg four times daily) for up to five days may be valuable in moderate to severe acute musculoskeletal pain. However, parenteral administration of this NSAID does not avoid the risk of gastroduodenal damage or of causing acute renal failure in high risk patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle relaxants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclobenzaprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methocarbamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methocarbamol</a>, and benzodiazepines may be beneficial for treating musculoskeletal chest pain, particularly if there is associated muscle spasm. Muscle relaxants are not recommended for older adult patients or those patients prone to misuse of the drugs. Long-term therapy for musculoskeletal chest pain with muscle relaxants should generally be avoided.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclobenzaprine</a> &ndash; Cyclobenzaprine at doses of 5 to 10 mg three times daily is more efficacious than placebo in the treatment of neck and low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There are no data that specifically address the efficacy of this agent in chest wall pain. If used, cyclobenzaprine is typically started at a dose of 10 mg PO once to three times daily. If cyclobenzaprine causes excessive sedation, it can be given at bedtime. The maximum dose is 20 mg three times daily, but this dose may cause excessive drowsiness in most patients. Patients should be warned about drowsiness with this agent and cautioned to avoid hazardous activities while taking it, especially driving an automobile.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methocarbamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methocarbamol</a> &ndash; Data are also lacking to assess the efficacy of methocarbamol for musculoskeletal chest pain; however, we use it for acute exacerbations of pain. Methocarbamol doses range from 750 mg to 1500 mg three times daily. As with other muscle relaxants, patients should be warned about sedative effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> &ndash; Because of the potential for abuse, benzodiazepines should be avoided for the treatment of isolated musculoskeletal chest pain in the absence of psychiatric indications. Patients should be cautioned about possible sedation and the potential for dependence or addiction.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tricyclic antidepressants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a> have been used for chest pain of neuropathic origin. They may also be useful for treatment of subacute or chronic chest pain of musculoskeletal origin, particularly that due to chronic costochondritis or fibromyalgia. A low dose of a tricyclic (eg, amitriptyline, 5 mg) at bedtime is used initially. The dose may be increased weekly to the maximum tolerated or the equivalent of 50 mg of amitriptyline. At higher doses, adverse effects are common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74319\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74319 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have also been used to treat symptoms of chronic pain. Overall they may be somewhat less effective in relieving pain than the tricyclic antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, the advantage in safety of SSRIs over the tricyclics may make an SSRI the antidepressant of choice, particularly if anxiety or depression is present, or if comorbidities (eg, coronary heart disease) that are relative contraindications to the use of tricyclics are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) may be helpful in the treatment of musculoskeletal chest pain if the pain is related to an underlying neuropathic or osteoarthritic mechanism. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Duloxetine</a> is available in the US for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis of the knee or low back pain. It may also be helpful in patients with widespread pain that is related to an underlying central amplification mechanism such as fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Effective doses range from 20 to 120 mg once daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults#H1979157\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;, section on 'Duloxetine'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticonvulsants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anticonvulsant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> has been used to treat chronic pain syndromes. The mechanism by which gabapentin produces pain relief is unknown. Somnolence and dizziness are common side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An empiric trial of gabapentin (starting at a dose of 100 mg three times daily, then slowly increasing the dose to a maximum of 3200 mg daily in divided doses as tolerated) may be considered for a patient with chronic chest wall pain that did not respond to other forms of therapy and prior to resorting to more invasive approaches such as local injection. Other anticonvulsants have also been used to treat chronic pain. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pregabalin</a> has also been used for widespread pain starting at 50 mg one to three times daily. The dose may be slowly increased in a stepwise fashion to 450 mg per day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444920545\"><span class=\"h2\">Opioids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of long-acting opioids should be avoided in patients with chest pain of musculoskeletal etiology, although for patients who have failed conservative treatment with NSAIDs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a> at a dose of 25 to 50 mg daily may be helpful. The dose may be titrated up to four times daily. For isolated acute exacerbations, short-acting mild opioids such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a> may also be used judiciously. Patients should be cautioned regarding sedation and potential for dependence when using opioids. The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain is discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Sternoclavicular joint injection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Manubriosternal joint'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Costochondral junctions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Sternoclavicular joint injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to injection of the sternoclavicular joint is similar to aspiration and injection of larger joints (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications&quot;</a>). Careful palpation of bony margins prior to skin preparation is helpful. The joint line of the sternoclavicular joint runs obliquely laterally from superior to inferior and may be identified while the patient retracts the shoulder. For injection of this joint, the patient should lie with the ipsilateral arm in lateral rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Ultrasound guidance may also be of benefit for joint aspiration or injection.

In general, the use of these interventions in treating musculoskeletal chest pain is based upon analogy with their usefulness in treating pain of similar origin elsewhere in the body (eg, neck and low back pain). This is particularly the case for the treatment of chronic chest pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpharmacologic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following interventions are generally recommended in the treatment of musculoskeletal chest pain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstrating that the pain can be reproduced or aggravated by palpation or provocative maneuvers may be reassuring to the patient. This shows that the pain is most likely arising from musculoskeletal structures and helps allay fear that the chest pain is due to heart disease or some other life-threatening problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arranging a follow-up visit (four to six weeks after the onset of the pain) also provides a way to assess the effectiveness of initial therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporarily avoiding any physical activity that caused or clearly exacerbates the chest pain is recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stretching and applying heat for muscle spasm or cold for swelling are recommended. Formal physical therapy may be necessary for patients with more chronic pain but with a goal of progressing to a home program.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Escalating pharmacologic interventions are employed according to the acuity and severity of the pain. Approaches for acute and chronic pain of mild, moderate, or severe intensity are described as follows:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute pain</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild acute pain &ndash; Topical agents such as sports creams, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> may be useful. Nonopioid analgesics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> up to 3 g per day in divided doses for adults) or over-the-counter nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 200 to 400 mg TID with meals) are used unless contraindicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate acute pain &ndash; Unless there are contraindications, prescription strength NSAIDs are generally used to treat moderate acute musculoskeletal pain (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 600 to 800 mg TID or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 250 to 500 mg BID).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients should be cautioned about possible adverse effects of NSAIDs and prophylaxis with antiulcer agents (eg, a proton pump inhibitor or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>), or use of a selective COX-2 inhibitor may be necessary if there are risk factors such as advanced age, prior gastric or duodenal ulcer disease, prior gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, or intolerance of nonselective NSAIDs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe acute pain &ndash; Severe musculoskeletal chest pain due to trauma (eg, a rib fracture or significant contusion) may require the short-term use of opioid analgesics. In patients with a history of substance abuse, an alternative to consider is intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> (15 to 30 mg) followed by oral ketorolac (up to 10 mg four times daily) for five days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe pain due to costochondritis, Tietze's syndrome, sternoclavicular or manubriosternal arthritis, may be best managed with a local injection of a mixture of corticosteroids and local anesthetic. Ultrasound guidance may be needed for joint aspiration or injection. If the treating clinician is not experienced in the injection technique for these disorders, and consultation with a rheumatologist, orthopedist, or pain-management specialist is not immediately available, then one of the following alternatives may be employed while the patient awaits an appointment for a local injection:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prescription-strength NSAIDs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Parenteral, followed by oral, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Short-term use of a short-acting opioid analgesic such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic pain</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild chronic pain &ndash; Use of a simple nonopioid analgesic such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> (up to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in divided doses for adults) or over-the-counter strength NSAIDs are recommended pharmacologic therapy for mild chronic pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate chronic pain &ndash; Addition of an antidepressant of the tricyclic or SSRI class <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> may be helpful when there is moderate chronic pain. Pain due to arthritis, costochondritis, or Tietze's syndrome may benefit from one or more local injections of glucocorticoids and a local anesthetic agent to the painful regions in addition to ongoing NSAID therapy. Local pain often may respond to a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> patch. Pain due to systemic rheumatic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or a seronegative spondyloarthropathy (eg, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis) may require addition of a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) or anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy to NSAID therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe chronic pain &ndash; In the authors' experience, severe chronic pain does not usually have a benign musculoskeletal origin. The diagnosis should be reconsidered. The possibility of the pain being neuropathic or arising from an occult neoplasm, infection, or a previously unrecognized fracture should be suspected and excluded by physical examination and appropriate imaging (eg, CT, MRI, or technetium labeled pyrophosphate bone scan).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If no underlying neoplastic disorder, infection, or fracture can be found, drug addiction is not suspected, and if local injections are either ineffective or not indicated (eg, when the tenderness is not localized to a joint or to a costochondral or sternoxiphoidal junction), then further treatment is directed along the lines outlined for management of chronic pain. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants play an important role in the treatment of such patients. Psychiatric evaluation may be valuable if anxiety, panic disorder, or depression is suspected to be amplifying the pain or the patient's behavior in response to it. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chronic use of opioid analgesics may be necessary in some cases, but the decision to use this approach is best made in consultation with a pain-management specialist. Opioid analgesics with mixed agonist and antagonist properties, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>, do not completely avoid the risk of development of dependence or addiction and the decision to use this agent chronically should be made with the same care as for other opioids such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a>.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Chambers J, Bass C, Mayou R.
