Discussions concerning the waterborne contaminants to which hemodialysis patients are exposed and the methods of monitoring water purification systems used in hemodialysis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contaminants in water used for hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintaining water quality for hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All dialysis facilities require a properly designed and maintained water treatment system to safeguard patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. No water supply can be considered safe for use in hemodialysis applications in the absence of a treatment system since some of the most toxic contaminants arise from municipal water treatment practices.</p><p>Water used for the preparation of dialysis fluid is generally derived from a source of potable water, such as a large municipal water supply, a community water system, or, in the case of patients treated at home in a rural area, from a private well. Within the United States, public water systems should meet the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Primary Drinking Water Regulations, which contain legally enforceable standards and treatment techniques for public water systems. Private wells are not regulated in the same way. The EPA merely recommends the testing of private wells and offers guidance on technologies that can be used to remove any contaminants; monitoring water quality is the responsibility of the well owner. The approach is similar in other countries. For example, in the United Kingdom, the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) is the independent regulator of drinking water, but, in the case of private wells, it delegates that responsibility to the local authority, which acts as the regulator for those water sources.</p><p>Hemodialysis patients are particularly vulnerable to contaminants in the water used to prepare concentrate and dialysis fluid or in water used for reprocessing dialyzers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reuse-of-dialyzers#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reuse of dialyzers&quot;, section on 'Reprocessing techniques'</a>). This vulnerability is due to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since water is the major constituent of dialysis fluid, compared with individuals who are not on hemodialysis, hemodialysis patients are exposed to extremely large volumes of water. The estimated water intake of a healthy individual is 2 L per day or 14 L per week. By comparison, during a single dialysis treatment lasting four hours, performed at a dialysis fluid flow rate of 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> a hemodialysis patient is exposed to 192 L of water, or to 576 L per week, if treated three times weekly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis patients have inadequate barriers to such contaminants. In healthy individuals who are not on dialysis, the gastrointestinal tract separates blood from contaminants in the water. By comparison, the barrier between blood and water in hemodialysis patients is the membrane within the hemodialyzer through which transfer of contaminants is limited only by the molecular or particulate size of the contaminant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis patients are unable to renally excrete any contaminants taken up from the dialysate.</p><p/><p>Additionally, when dialyzers are reused, water is introduced into the blood compartment of the dialyzer during reprocessing. Contaminants in this water may be trapped in the blood compartment and the patient directly exposed to them during the next dialysis treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reuse-of-dialyzers#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reuse of dialyzers&quot;, section on 'Potential risks'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OBTAINING A WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most dialysis facilities obtain their water treatment system from a vendor specializing in such equipment. To enable informed decisions to be made, the purchaser should be familiar with functions of the various elements of the water treatment system, which are described in the international standard entitled Water Treatment Equipment for Hemodialysis Applications and Related Therapies (ISO 26722:2014),<em> </em>published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The United States has an equivalent standard, which is identical to the international standard but incorporates a US deviation in respect of the methodology used to quantify bacterial contaminants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>To ensure that a water treatment system meets the requirements of the applicable international or national standard, the medical staff of a facility should have a fundamental understanding of the principles of water treatment for hemodialysis, participate in the system's design, and be involved in the implementation of standard operating protocols to ensure safe running of hemodialysis water treatment infrastructure. A thorough understanding is necessary for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although individual municipal water supplies comply with National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWRs or primary standards), which are legally enforceable standards that protect public health by limiting the levels of contaminants in drinking water, such water must undergo additional treatment in order to meet requirements outlined by ISO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and the American National Standards Institute <span class=\"nowrap\">(ANSI)/Association</span> for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The design of the water treatment infrastructure must be appropriately tailored to provide that additional treatment given local requirements and feed water chemistry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medical director of a facility has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the patients are treated with water that, at a minimum, meets the contaminant standards set forth by the AAMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] or other applicable recommendations organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p>Once a water treatment system is installed and shown to be operating properly, a monitoring system should be in place to ensure that performance is maintained, procedures are followed, and water quality is routinely assessed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintaining water quality for hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">WATER PURIFICATION PROCESSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water utilized in hemodialysis applications is generally prepared by a number of different purification processes assembled in a cascade. Commonly used purification techniques include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reverse osmosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deionization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbon filtration</p><p/><p>The most commonly used processes are reverse osmosis and carbon filtration. Deionization is used less frequently to supplement, or in place of, reverse osmosis. These primary purification components may be supplemented by secondary components, such as softeners, filters, and chemical injection systems. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Reverse osmosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reverse osmosis is a process by which water is forced across a semipermeable membrane by high pressure (200 to 250 pounds per square inch [PSI]). Reverse osmosis alone or in combination with deionization is used in approximately 98 percent of water treatment systems used for hemodialysis applications in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Reverse osmosis systems are operated in a cross-flow mode, meaning that the feed-water stream flows parallel to the membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63776\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63776 \">figure 1</a>). The high transmembrane pressure gradient forces water across the membrane to form product water (ie, permeate). The remaining feed water carries the concentrated contaminants to the drain in the reject water.</p><p>Reverse osmosis may be operated in a single- or double-module configuration. When using a single module, the feed water enters as a single stream and exits either as reject water containing concentrated contaminants or as product water (permeate) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63776\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63776 \">figure 1</a>). In such a system, up to 75 percent of the feed water can be recovered as product water. However, because the recovery rate is highly dependent upon the feed-water temperature and the levels of substances that can foul the membranes, recovery rates of 35 to 50 percent are more common. To improve recovery, part of the reject water may optionally be blended with the feed water, allowing for a higher recovery of feed water as product water, an important consideration as many areas face a warmer and dryer climate, which places greater demand on water supplies.</p><p>Typically, a single-module reverse osmosis system will meet the microbiological and chemical standards for hemodialysis. In the presence of variable quality feed water, a double-module or two-stage reverse osmosis system may be preferred. In that configuration, two reverse osmosis modules operate in series, with the permeate from the first module serving as the feed water for the second module. A double-module reverse osmosis system offers enhanced product water quality and can be an alternative to the combination of reverse osmosis and deionization in situations where a single-stage reverse osmosis is inadequate to provide water of the requisite quality. Because the feed water to the second stage is already of high quality, it can be operated at a much higher recovery rate than the first stage.</p><p>As many dialysis centers operate 24 hours per day almost seven days per week, a further advantage of a double-module or two-stage system is that, should one of the modules fail, it may be bypassed, thus preventing severe disruption or delays to treatment schedules.</p><p>Although the capital cost is relatively high, reverse osmosis has the following advantages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Its operating costs are low</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It has essentially unlimited capacity for contaminant removal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It effectively removes a wide range of inorganic and organic contaminants</p><p/><p>Reverse osmosis membranes filter out dissolved substances, such as metal ions, salts, and inorganic and organic chemicals, and microbial elements, including bacteria, endotoxins, and viruses. The most commonly used reverse osmosis membrane for hemodialysis applications is made of polyamide. Such membranes, unlike those manufactured from cellulose acetate, are not susceptible to biological degradation and hydrolysis but are highly sensitive to chlorine exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The effectiveness with which reverse osmosis membranes filter out water contaminants depends upon characteristics of the contaminant, including particle charge and size.</p><p>Ionic contaminants are more effectively filtered than those of a similar size that are neutrally charged. Approximately 95 to 99 percent of ions are filtered out by the reverse osmosis membrane. Polyvalent ions are more readily rejected by the membrane than monovalent ions. The removal of organic contaminants by the reverse osmosis membrane is largely based on size; organic contaminants with molecular weight &gt;200 kDa are effectively filtered out.</p><p>It is important to prevent oxidation and degradation of the reverse osmosis membrane, which may occur upon exposure to such contaminants as chlorine and monochloramine or to high concentrations (&gt;1 percent) of peracetic acid if used as a disinfectant. Degradation of the membrane compromises its ability to remove contaminants from the water, and, for that reason, reverse osmosis is not an effective means of removing either chlorine or monochloramine (which are added to municipal water supplies and are thus common contaminants of dialysis water supplies). Chlorine and monochloramine are normally removed by carbon beds installed in series before the reverse osmosis unit, although other methods might be required in certain circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Carbon filtration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Deionization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deionization may be utilized as a secondary purification step following reverse osmosis if reverse osmosis alone is insufficient to provide water of the requisite quality because of high concentrations of one or more ionic contaminants in the feed water. Deionization is a process by which ion-exchange resins are used to remove ionic contaminants from water by exchanging hydrogen ions for cations (cationic resins) and hydroxyl ions for anions (anionic resins). Mixed-bed deionizers contain both cationic and anionic resins; the exchanged hydrogen and hydroxyl ions combine to form water.</p><p>Although mixed-bed deionizers effectively remove ionic contaminants, they <strong>do not</strong> remove uncharged contaminants, bacteria, or endotoxins. Furthermore, the resins provide a good environment for bacterial proliferation and often worsen the microbiologic quality of water passing through them, increasing the requirement for bacterial control after the deionizer to ensure that the product water meets the appropriate microbiologic quality.</p><p>Deionizer performance must be monitored closely and continuously since, once the resins are exhausted, ions previously removed and bound to the resin with low affinity can be re-released back into the water through displacement by ions with greater binding affinity. Such a release has been reported to cause acute, fatal fluoride toxicity in hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. To guard against such accidental exposure, the product water-specific resistivity (expressed in megaohm <span class=\"nowrap\">[M&Omega;]/cm)</span> or conductivity (expressed in micro Siemens <span class=\"nowrap\">[S]/cm)</span> is continuously monitored using temperature-compensated methods. A decrease in the product water-specific resistivity to &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">M&Omega;/cm</span> suggests an increased risk of producing contaminated water, and water should be prevented from reaching any point of use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Carbon filtration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generally, all hemodialysis water treatment systems should include carbon filtration in the form of carbon beds to remove chlorine or chloramines. Chlorine or chloramine, derived from chlorine and ammonia, are usually added to municipal water supplies for disinfection. Depending on the pH and the concentration of chlorine relative to that of ammonia, monochloramine, dichloramine, and trichloramine are formed, of which monochloramine is the most frequently encountered form in the municipal water supply. Neither chlorine nor monochloramine is removed by reverse osmosis.</p><p>Apart from protecting the reverse osmosis membrane from degradation, it is important to remove chlorine and chloramines because exposure to these substances can result in hemolysis or resistance to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p>In addition to the removal of chlorines and chloramines, carbon filtration provides nonspecific removal of organic contaminants from water. The long-term effects of organic contaminants on hemodialysis patients are unknown. There is only one report of contamination of a hemodialysis water supply with an organic compound (trichloroethylene) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) has been found in tap water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and in water used for hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Concentrations at the inlet to the water treatment system, which included carbon filtration and reverse osmosis, ranged between &lt;0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> and 5.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Similar levels were detected at the entrance to the dialysis machine, suggesting that carbon filtration and reverse osmosis may not provide an adequate safeguard against organic contaminants.</p><p>The one circumstance in which the use of carbon filtration is not indicated is when it is clear that the municipal water supply is disinfected by a means other than chlorination, such as ozone.</p><p>Carbon beds, which cannot be regenerated, have a finite capacity for chloramine. To prevent inadvertent exposure of patients to chloramine as the capacity of the carbon is exhausted, two carbon beds are installed in series. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Assembling a water treatment system'</a> below.)</p><p>Traditionally, granular-activated carbon (GAC) has been used for chloramine removal. Effectiveness of removal is indicated by either the iodine number, a measure of the carbon's capacity to absorb low-molecular-weight substances, or empty bed contact time (EBCT), a measure of how much contact occurs between the carbon and water as the water flows through the bed of carbon. When carbon is used for the removal of chloramine, it should have an iodine number of at least 900 and should be used in beds with an EBCT of at least 10 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>EBCT can be calculated from the following formula:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;EBCT = (7.48 x V) &divide; Q</p></div></div><p>where V is the volume of carbon (ft<sup>3</sup>) and Q is the water flow rate <span class=\"nowrap\">(gal/min)</span>.</p><p>Catalytic-activated carbon may also be used since it removes chloramine more effectively than traditional GAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Carbon beds are usually installed in series before a reverse osmosis unit for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbon beds remove chlorine and chloramines that can degrade some reverse osmosis membranes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since carbon beds provide a good environment for bacterial proliferation, reverse osmosis units supply a barrier against microbiologic contaminants derived from the bed.</p><p/><p>Inadequate removal of chloramine by carbon can occur when the pH of the water is high or when municipal water contains high levels of organic material or additives, such as orthophosphate, for lead and copper control.</p><p>In circumstances in which there is inadequate removal of chloramines by carbon, other strategies for chloramine removal might be needed. One approach that has been used successfully is the injection of sodium bisulfite prior to the reverse osmosis system (see <a href=\"#H616651220\" class=\"local\">'Chemical injection'</a> below). Other approaches include installing anion exchange resin before the carbon beds to remove organic matter and other contaminants that may foul the activated carbon and injection of a mineral acid before the carbon beds to reduce the pH of alkaline feed water. (See <a href=\"#H616651220\" class=\"local\">'Chemical injection'</a> below.)</p><p>Inadequate removal of chloramine can also appear to occur when naturally occurring N-chloramines are present in the water. N-chloramines are relatively large molecules that are effectively removed by reverse osmosis. However, N-chloramines test positive in the assays used for chloramine and may erroneously suggest inadequate chloramine removal by the carbon beds. Naturally occurring N-chloramines may be distinguished from other chloramines by checking the chloramine level in the reverse osmosis permeate. A negative test in the reverse osmosis permeate, in the presence of a positive test in the water leaving the carbon beds, suggests that the substance detected is N-chloramine rather than monochloramine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other purification processes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water treatment systems may include other devices, such as softeners, filters, and chemical injection systems. These components are frequently included to extend the life and ensure optimal performance of the principal purification processes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Softeners</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Softening is a commonly used auxiliary purification process. Softening is a form of deionizer that exchanges calcium and magnesium ions for sodium ions. Softeners are used in locations where the municipal water supply is &quot;hard&quot; due to high levels of calcium and magnesium. Although calcium and magnesium ions are effectively removed by reverse osmosis, the use of a water softener before the reverse osmosis unit will protect the reverse osmosis membranes from scale deposits and fouling by calcium and magnesium salts.</p><p>As with all deionizers, softeners have a finite capacity and must be regenerated by exposing the resin to a strong brine solution. This process is performed in situ using pelletized salt to form the brine solution. Such solutions have a very high sodium concentration; therefore, all softeners used for hemodialysis applications should include a regeneration lock-out system to prevent regeneration during patient treatment and brine from entering the softener's product-water stream.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Filters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of filters may be utilized, both in pretreatment for the principal purification processes and at the end of the purification and in the water distribution system to control particulate and microbiologic contaminants. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depth filters (also known as bed filters, sediment filters, or multimedia filters) to remove coarse particulate matter at the beginning of the purification cascade</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cartridge filters to protect reverse osmosis membranes from fine particles washed out of carbon beds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Submicron bacteria- and endotoxin-retentive filters to control microbiologic contaminants in the water distribution system</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H616651220\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemical injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemical injection systems can be used to adjust feed water properties to ensure optimal operation of the principal purification process. Examples include the addition of sodium bisulfite to remove chloramine and the addition of acid to adjust pH.</p><p>Injection systems should be designed to tightly control addition of the chemical. For systems that automatically add chemical based on some continuously monitored variable, such as pH, there should be independent monitoring of that variable after the point of addition to ensure that the concentration of the added chemical is kept in a range that does not adversely impact the performance of other purification processes. For example, the rejection of fluoride by thin film composite reverse osmosis membranes can be substantially reduced if the pH is allowed to fall below 7.</p><p>A mineral acid should be used to adjust pH since organic acids can serve as a nutrient for bacteria and encourage their proliferation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">WATER STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The water distribution system includes the pipes, valves, storage tanks, and pumps that are used to transport the water from the purification system to its point of use at the individual dialysis stations. There are two basic designs for distribution systems, including a direct feed, which does not include a water storage tank, and an indirect feed, which incorporates a water storage tank (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58319\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58319 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Both systems offer advantages and disadvantages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extra capacity provided by the storage tank in the indirect-feed system allows use of a water treatment system that produces less than the peak water demand. Also, the water reserve in a storage tank provides a buffer that allows for an orderly discontinuation of dialysis in the event that the water treatment system fails. By comparison, direct-feed systems must produce water at (or above) the peak demand, and all dialysis ends abruptly if failure occurs since the water supply to the dialysis machines is interrupted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pressure in an indirect-feed system can be increased by means of a booster pump; as a result, an indirect feed might be the only choice if the patient care area is located one or more floors above the water treatment system. By comparison, the pressure in a direct-feed system is limited to the outlet pressure of the last purification device.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial control is easier with a direct-feed system since it does not contain the large volume of semi-stagnant water found in storage tanks.</p><p/><p>Other considerations in the design of the water distribution and storage system include the use of inert materials that can tolerate the most effective methods of disinfection and employing a system design that minimizes the potential for bacterial growth.</p><p>Since purified water must be delivered to its point of use without recontamination, the water-contacting surfaces of all piping, valves, storage tanks, and pumps in the distribution system must be constructed of inert materials. As highly purified water will leach metals and chemicals from components with which it comes into contact, no brass, aluminum, or galvanized metal parts can be used. Materials that can tolerate disinfection with hot water or ozone are preferred and are now available. These systems are more easily disinfected than systems that rely upon chemical germicides because there are no chemical residuals to rinse from the system before dialysis can be restarted.</p><p>All water distribution systems should be designed to minimize bacterial growth. Physical characteristics, notably the smoothness of the pipe surface and joints within the distribution network, affect the degree to which biofilm forms. Dead-ends or stagnant areas also serve as sites for bacterial proliferation. Because of this, the distribution system should be configured in a continuous loop to minimize bacterial proliferation and biofilm formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58319\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58319 \">figure 2</a>), avoiding multiple branches, and keeping any dead-ended branches as short as possible. As rough surfaces are more conducive to biofilm formation and maturation than smooth surfaces, joints between sections of pipe and between pipes and fittings should be formed in a manner that minimizes the formation of crevices and other voids that may serve as sites for bacterial colonization.</p><p>In addition to the surface characteristics of the material, which govern bacterial adhesion, hydrodynamics also play a role. Fluid flow through a pipe may produce a sufficiently high shear rate to inhibit cell attachment or cause the detachment of an established biofilm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, microbial growth and biofilm formation in hydraulic systems cannot be prevented by fluid velocity alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>While these design features can help reduce bacterial growth, they are no substitute for regular disinfection of the water storage and distribution system.</p><p>When used, a storage tank should be designed to minimize the potential for bacterial growth:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It should have a tight-fitting lid and conical or bowl-shaped base; drain from its lowest point; be vented through a 0.45 micrometer hydrophobic air filter; avoid the incorporation of a sight tube; and, if an overflow pipe is incorporated, this should be fitted with means to prevent contamination arising from backflow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It should permit adequate disinfection and rinsing.</p><p/><p>Bladder-type or pressurized surge tanks should not be used.</p><p>The inclusion of a bacteria- and endotoxin-retentive filter at the point of use, such as at the dialysis machine, can provide dialysate of very high microbiologic quality; however, such a point-of-use filter should not be used as an alternative to careful design and maintenance of the entire water treatment and distribution system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSEMBLING A WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The combination of water purification processes needed to produce water that consistently meets applicable standards will vary from facility to facility, depending upon the nature of the water supply and the applications for which the water is intended. Detailed design of a water treatment system will generally be undertaken by a specialist vendor. If the entire system is not obtained from a single supplier, then the user becomes responsible for ensuring that the separate parts of the system are compatible.</p><p>The technical features of the water treatment system should be based on standards published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), in collaboration with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI),<em> </em>with special regard to the aspects related to the water quality, the optimal use of resources (eg, water and energy), and the operations of disinfection and maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Consideration in the design stage should be given to compliance with mandatory local regulations, to the capability of operating with the available feed-water supply, and to the anticipated range of variation in the quality of the water.</p><p>New-build renal units should have a direct, independent-feed (drinking or potable) water supply that is separate from others that may exist on the site. If existing water supply systems are used, there should be awareness of the potential risks that may arise from the presence of chemicals used to minimize legionellae growth or to clean such systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>The following process can be used to determine the basic elements of a system and to evaluate the overall suitability of systems proposed by vendors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 1 &ndash; The clinician should obtain an analysis of the water entering the dialysis facility with respect to the chemical contaminants included in the appropriate standards. This analysis should be supplemented by information from the municipal water supplier. The water supplier should be asked to provide information about seasonal variations in water quality. For example, both aluminum and chloramine levels tend to vary seasonally. In the setting of seasonal variation, system design and evaluation should be based upon the worst possible case.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 2 &ndash; The quality of the product water must comply with standards for water for hemodialysis and related therapies published by the ISO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and jointly by the ANSI and AAMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]<em>. </em>If the water is to be used for dialyzer reprocessing (in addition to dialysis), it may be desirable to set a more rigid standard for microbiologic contaminants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 3 &ndash; For each contaminant, the required reduction in concentration is determined by dividing the supply-water concentration by the maximum concentration allowed by the appropriate standards (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72685\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72685 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 4 &ndash; The values determined in step 3 are compared with what can be achieved by various purification methods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F78701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78701 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 5 &ndash; Possible purification cascades are designed that will provide the desired reduction for all contaminants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 6 &ndash; The purification cascades are reviewed to eliminate redundancy. For example, it might not be necessary to include both reverse osmosis and deionization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F81113\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81113 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 7 &ndash; A water distribution system is chosen.</p><p/><p>The adoption of such a stepwise process will assist in selecting a system that meets facility requirements.</p><p>At the planning stage and when making the final selection of system, consideration should be given to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>System capacity during sanitation. If heat sanitation is chosen, the treated water distribution loop is sanitized along with the lines linking the dialysis machines to the distribution loop. The demand for water during sanitation can be higher than that required during normal operation of the dialysis machines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>System capacity during winter months. Commonly, the capacity of a reverse osmosis system is rated at a specified inlet water temperature. That temperature may not be reliably achieved during winter months. To prevent insufficient production of treated water during that time, it may be necessary to incorporate a water heater and blending valve to maintain the inlet water temperature or to install a system with increased capacity to compensate for the fall in efficiency at the lower temperature during the winter months.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1514575171\"><span class=\"h1\">INSTALLING A WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM AND VERIFYING ITS PERFORMANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to routinely obtain water of the requisite quality from a water treatment and distribution system depends not only on selection of an appropriate system design, but also on ensuring that the system functions correctly from the beginning of its operational life.</p><p>Installation of a water treatment system should be undertaken by qualified personnel in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. On completion of the installation, the user should be provided with schematic diagrams that identify all components, valves, sample ports, and the direction of flow. In addition to clearly identifying each major system component, its function should be described, along with instructions on how to verify its performance and what actions to take if that performance is not within an acceptable range.</p><p>Installation is followed by system commissioning and performance validation to demonstrate that the system is &quot;fit for purpose&quot; and that it consistently produces water meeting the quality requirements of the appropriate standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Such validation is undertaken not only when commissioning a new system but also when upgrading an existing system. Validation consists of two phases (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintaining water quality for hemodialysis&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Verification that the system is operating correctly under that expected range of operating conditions and that the safety and alarm systems are fully functional. At this point, there should also be documentation that operators and maintenance personnel have received the necessary training. This initial phase of validation following commissioning should be completed before any patients are treated with water from the system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On completion of the verification phase, the robustness of the system is checked under normal operating conditions. During this phase, key indicators of equipment performance are monitored intensively. Trend analysis of water quality, both chemical and microbiological, is performed. These data are used to establish the frequency of routine monitoring of water quality and disinfection schedules. Intensive monitoring should continue for as long as it takes to be sure that the disinfection schedule is adequate to manage the tendency for biofilm to form in the system, remembering that failure to detect planktonic organisms is not strong evidence that immature biofilm is not forming in the system.</p><p/><p>Further information on the steps to be taken in commissioning a new or modified water treatment system can be found in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 23500:2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1941792450\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTINGENCY PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unexpected events, such as failure of the facility's water supply or electrical service following a natural disaster or water main break, can occur at any time. A contingency plan should be developed that describes how to deal with an event that completely prevents dialysis from being performed. Contingency planning should also address how to deal with unplanned changes in municipal water quality, such as may occur following additional disinfection of the water supply following a water main break or the introduction of nonstandard chemicals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20840487\"><span class=\"h1\">WATER TREATMENT FOR HOSPITAL BEDSIDE DIALYSIS MACHINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemodialysis machines that are used at the hospital bedside, such as in an intensive care unit, require a mobile system of water purification capable of producing dialysis water that meets the requirements of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13959; 2014:&nbsp;Water&nbsp;for hemodialysis&nbsp;and related therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] or the equivalent US standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Low-volume hemodialysis systems that are used for home hemodialysis (such as the NxStage&nbsp;System One) do not require a separate system of water purification, since water treatment is an integral part of the system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-home-hemodialysis-the-low-dialysate-volume-approach#H7208654\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily home hemodialysis: The low dialysate volume approach&quot;, section on 'Dialysate composition'</a>.)</p><p>In principle, the approach to treating water for mobile hemodialysis systems is similar to that used in an outpatient dialysis facility, as described above. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Water purification processes'</a> above.)</p><p>The equipment used depends on the quality of the available feed water but generally includes a softener, carbon&nbsp;filtration, reverse osmosis&nbsp;system, and point-of-use ultrafiltration. The softener may be omitted to reduce the weight and space requirements of the system, providing the water has a low degree of hardness. However, as noted above, omission of a softener may result in increased fouling of the reverse osmosis membrane by calcium and magnesium salts. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Softeners'</a> above.)</p><p>Compared with fixed-station systems, such as are used in outpatient facilities, mobile units are more susceptible to bacterial proliferation since they are used intermittently. This requires close attention to a number of specific design and maintenance aspects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A direct-feed system is generally used for mobile systems. The lack of a storage tank helps minimize bacterial proliferation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58319\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58319 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The design should allow for easy sanitization, preferably using hot water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A point-of-use ultrafilter should be incorporated in the dialysis machine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When use is intermittent, even in the absence of a storage tank, there is the potential for bacterial growth because of stagnant water in the system. The potential for bacterial proliferation can be diminished by operating the equipment for at least 15 minutes each day, regardless of whether or not a treatment is performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A backflow prevention device, such as a Pressure Principle Backflow Assembly (PPBA), a vacuum breaker, or a Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) valve, must be installed at the point of connection of the mobile system to the potable water supply in cases where a mobile water treatment system connects directly to the hospital's potable water supply.</p><p/><p>It is important that electrical noise and current leakage be minimized, particularly if the equipment is used in an intensive care setting, where other electrical equipment used in the treatment of the patient may be in close proximity. The hemodialysis water treatment systems used in such locations should comply with applicable electrical safety standards regarding electrostatic discharge (ESD), electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), and any other electrical safety standards as outlined in IIEC 60601-1:2006+A12:2014 Medical electrical equipment. General requirements for basic safety and essential performance. Portable water treatment system component enclosures should possess a level of water resistance equal to ISO 60529 IPX1 (vertically falling water drops).</p><p>As mobile water treatment systems are operated away from the dialysis unit and are generally connected to the hospital's water supply, medical and technical staff involved in setting up and operating the equipment should be aware of measures that are used to sanitize the hospital water supply (particularly with respect to <em>Legionella</em>). The staff should also be trained on how to determine that water quality is adequate for dialysis to proceed, including log sheets to record all measures of water&nbsp;treatment system performance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1592969336\"><span class=\"h1\">WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR HOME HEMODIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In principle, the treatment of water for use in home hemodialysis is comparable with that described in the above sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Installations for home hemodialysis should include carbon filters or beds with built in redundancy, heat disinfection, a reverse osmosis unit, and point-of-use ultrafiltration. If needed, a water softener should also form part of the treatment process. In locations with appreciable seasonal variations in feed water temperature, a tempering valve might be needed to provide a consistent feed water temperature by blending hot and cold water.</p><p>The hemodialysis water treatment system should be isolated from the municipal water supply by installation of a backflow prevention device, such as a pressure principle backflow assembly (PPBA), a vacuum breaker, or a reduced pressure zone (RPZ) valve, in accordance with local plumbing regulations.</p><p>One important difference between home and in-center hemodialysis is that the water supply for home hemodialysis may come from a small community water supply or from a private well. Such water supplies are subject to different water testing regulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>When the feed water is from a private well, close attention should be paid to the quality of the feed water since well water is subject to seasonal changes and contamination from a variety of other sources such as agricultural waste, chemicals used in hydrocarbon extraction, septic tanks, or underground fuel storage tank seepage. Due to its nature, the quality of such a supply may be subject to a higher rate of failure in terms of microbiologic and chemical quality. The higher noncompliance with drinking water standards is because monitoring the quality of water from a private well is the responsibility of the well owner (at least in the United States); the role of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is limited to recommending testing and providing guidance on how to remove any contaminants. The approach is similar in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, where the Drinking Water Inspectorate delegates responsibility for private wells to the local authority. In 2000, a public health study of pathogens in US groundwater supplies reported results of sampling of 244 public water-supply wells prior to any treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of wells initially considered more vulnerable to contamination and 40 percent of wells considered less vulnerable were positive for one or more fecal indicators (total coliform bacteria, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, enterococci, viruses infecting coliform bacteria, and human viruses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Subsequently, the United States Geological Survey studied the water quality of over 2000 private wells to assess the existence and extent of contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The study found that water from approximately 23 percent of the wells had at least one contaminant at a level of potential health concern. More recently, it was reported that 21 million people in the United States relied on community water systems that violated health-based quality standards, particularly in rural areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and, in the United Kingdom, a study of tap water from 497 properties using private water supplies in an area of metalliferous and arsenic mineralization found that 65 percent of samples contained one or more contaminants at levels exceeding drinking water quality standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis patients are particularly vulnerable to contaminants in the water used to prepare concentrate and dialysis fluid. No municipal water can be considered safe for direct use in hemodialysis applications. All dialysis facilities therefore require a properly designed and maintained water treatment system to safeguard patients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for water purification systems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of water purification processes required to produce water that consistently meets applicable standards will vary from facility to facility, depending upon the nature of the water supply and the applications for which the water is intended. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Assembling a water treatment system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly used processes to minimize chemical contaminant risk to the dialysis patient are reverse osmosis and carbon filtration. Deionization is used less frequently to supplement, or in place of, reverse osmosis. Water treatment systems can also include other devices, such as softeners, filters, and chemical injection systems, depending on the nature of the local water supply. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Water purification processes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since purified water must be delivered to its point of use without recontamination, the water-contacting surfaces of all piping, valves, storage tanks, and pumps in the distribution system must be constructed of inert materials. No brass, aluminum, or galvanized metal parts can be used. Materials that can tolerate disinfection with hot water or ozone are preferred. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Water storage and distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis machines that are used at the hospital bedside, such as in an intensive care unit, require a mobile system of water purification. Mobile water purification systems generally use an approach similar to that used an outpatient dialysis facility, although there are specific concerns related to the prevention of bacterial contamination. (See <a href=\"#H20840487\" class=\"local\">'Water treatment for hospital bedside dialysis machines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Water treatment systems intended for use in home hemodialysis are similar to those used in other settings but reduced in size. In the home dialysis setting, careful attention must be paid to the quality of the feed water and system components sized to ensure that they are able to treat feed water more susceptible to chemical and bacterial contamination.
