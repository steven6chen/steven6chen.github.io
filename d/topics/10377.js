However, the association between HL and pregnancy is uncommon. HL is diagnosed in approximately 1:1000 to 1:6000 pregnancies and accounts for 3 percent or fewer of all patients with HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathologic features, and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>As a result, there are few large series that have evaluated the many issues that must be addressed in such women. This topic will review the clinical presentation and management of HL during pregnancy, the interaction of malignancy and pregnancy, and the effects of treatment on the developing fetus and delivered infant. The diagnosis and management of HL in the nonpregnant adult is discussed separately.

Of importance, some signs and symptoms due to the HL (eg, fatigue, shortness of breath, anemia, thrombocytopenia) overlap with common signs and symptoms seen during pregnancy, potentially resulting in a delay of diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults#H78183236\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Retrospective case series have described the clinical presentation of pregnant women with HL, with generally similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/1,3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-6</a>]. One of the larger series consisted of 48 women (median age 26 years) with 50 pregnancies occurring during active HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The diagnosis of HL was made in 12 patients before conception, in 10 during pregnancy, and in 27 within nine months after delivery or pregnancy termination. Each pregnant woman was matched with three nonpregnant HL controls. The stage at diagnosis did not differ significantly from the controls: stage I, 25 percent; stage II, 46 percent; stage III, 17 percent; and stage IV, 12 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73699\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73699 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults#H78183236\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of B symptoms (ie, fever, night sweats, or weight loss exceeding 10 percent of body weight) is variable. While most patients from North American series have presented without B symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/1,4,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5,7</a>], one report from Mexico described B symptoms in 10 of 14 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Criteria for B symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96544367\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of HL is made based upon the pathologic evaluation of involved tissue, usually a lymph node biopsy. An excisional lymph node biopsy, performed under local or general anesthesia, is preferred and the risk of anesthesia and biopsy is similar to that of healthy pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in adults&quot;, section on 'Tissue biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>The pathologic subtype of HL diagnosed during pregnancy is consistent with that commonly seen in women of reproductive age. As an example, in a series of 40 women with HL during pregnancy, 35 were classified as nodular sclerosis type, two as mixed cellularity type, and three were unclassified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A similar predominance of nodular sclerosis type has been noted in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>].

For women with HL diagnosed during pregnancy, the recommended staging studies have evolved with changing technology and therapeutic options. The goal of staging in this setting is to provide the clinician and patient with enough information to guide management while limiting the risks to the fetus.</p><p>The initial staging evaluation should include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81526\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81526 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single <span class=\"nowrap\">posterior/anterior</span> view chest x-ray with adequate abdominal shielding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies including a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum creatinine concentration, serum liver enzymes, and HIV serology. Of importance, ESR is often significantly elevated during normal pregnancy. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of the abdomen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound</p><p/><p>Evaluation of the abdomen with MRI is generally preferred to ultrasound, as it can evaluate lymph nodes, liver, and spleen with good accuracy. Although there are limited data regarding its safety in this setting, it is thought that MRI is probably safe in the pregnant patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Abdominal ultrasound is known to be safe in the pregnant population, but is much less sensitive than MRI. In contrast, computed tomography (CT) scan exposes the fetus to potentially harmful radiation and therefore is rarely performed if MRI and abdominal ultrasound are available. Positron emission tomography (PET) is contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The use of diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bone marrow biopsy can be safely performed during pregnancy. A unilateral bone marrow biopsy should be performed for patients with B symptoms, clinical stage IIB to IV disease, and for patients with otherwise unexplained cytopenias. In addition, a thorough examination by an otolaryngologist should be performed for patients with stage IA or IIA disease with upper cervical lymph node involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults#H1444841812\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in adults&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>If therapy is deferred until after delivery, a standard staging evaluation may be performed after delivery. In contrast, patients who receive treatment (eg, ABVD, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>) during pregnancy cannot be accurately staged after delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF TREATMENT DURING PREGNANCY ON FETAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both radiation therapy and chemotherapy are potential teratogens. The risk of fetal malformation or death is dependent upon the stage of fetal development, fetal susceptibility, the agent utilized, and the fetal dose of that agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">First trimester</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first trimester is the most critical period for chemotherapeutic drug exposure, as implantation (weeks 1 to 2) and embryogenesis proceed (weeks 3 to 8). The major manifestations of drug toxicity at this time are spontaneous abortions during implantation and major morphological abnormalities during embryogenesis. Some structures, such as the limbs and palate, have limited &quot;windows&quot; of vulnerability during embryogenesis, while other organs, such as the central nervous system, may be affected throughout all phases of embryogenesis, fetal development, and growth.</p><p>With chemotherapy, the placenta plays a pivotal role in drug transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As such, chemotherapy administered inadvertently in the first two weeks of pregnancy (prior to the development of the placenta) will generally be less teratogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In comparison, single agent and combination chemotherapy administered in the remainder of the first trimester results in a risk of congenital malformations of approximately 10 percent and 15 to 25 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The absolute risk is difficult to determine and varies with agent.</p><p>The placental cells have a multidrug resistance phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], which may reduce or prevent transfer to the fetus of such natural products as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>. However, case reports regarding the efficiency of placental transfer of doxorubicin are inconclusive. Fetal drug metabolism and excretion must also consider amniotic fluid recirculation (ie, fetal swallowing of the amniotic fluid). This feature helps to explain the marked teratogenicity of the folate antagonists, aminopterin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, when given at regular chemotherapeutic doses.</p><p>Radiation exposure of the fetus during the first trimester is associated with teratogenesis and an increased risk of childhood malignancy. The incidence of these effects depends upon the fetal dose of exposure, which in turn is dependent upon the radiation dose, radiation field size, and the distance between the radiation field and the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H351935924\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Second and third trimesters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse effects of chemotherapy on the fetus are often more subtle during the second and third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/14,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18,19</a>]. Among the possible toxic effects are low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, premature birth, stillborn fetus, impaired functional development, intellectual disability (mental retardation), and diminished learning capability. In one study, there was limited fetal exposure after the administration of ABVD to baboons in the second and third trimester of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. As described below, chemotherapy for HL has been administered successfully during the second and third trimesters with positive outcomes for both the mother and developing fetus. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>With radiation therapy, increasing uterine fundal height affects total dose exposure from internal radiation scatter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The closer the fetus is to the diaphragm, the greater the possible whole body fetal dose when the mother receives radiation above the diaphragm. However, this effect is potentially counteracted by the larger fetus being more developed and therefore less sensitive to radiation. Older studies have estimated fetal radiation exposure after mantle radiation during the three trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/1,7,21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,21-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The late manifestations of in utero exposure to antineoplastic agents may include impaired growth, diminished neurologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intellectual function, decreased gonadal and reproductive function, mutagenesis of germ-line tissue, and carcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There are limited data that address the risks that may be involved.

The children ranged in age from 3 to 19 years at the time of evaluation and were compared with a case control group of 25 children. In a comprehensive evaluation, all of the 43 children were within the normal range for routine blood work, lymphocyte function, immunoglobulins, cytogenetics, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, school performance, neurologic testing, sexual development, and medical history. Further follow-up of the same cohort with expansion to 26 mothers with HL and a median follow-up of 18.7 years confirmed good health in the children and grandchildren [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF HL DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of HL during pregnancy requires a careful balance between maximizing the chance of cure and minimizing the potential harm to the developing fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. While most pregnant women with HL diagnosed during pregnancy undergo therapy, case series have suggested that treatment can be safely deferred in selected women until fetal development and growth permits safe delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H351936082\" class=\"local\">'Selection of patients for deferred therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The selection of initial treatment during pregnancy depends upon the trimester and the location and stage of disease. In general, therapy should be delayed until at least the second trimester, if possible, since the risks of treatment to the fetus are greatest during the first trimester. Some patients may be candidates for deferred therapy after the first trimester (ie, asymptomatic, stable, nonbulky, supradiaphragmatic disease). However, appropriate therapy should <strong>not</strong> be delayed past the first trimester in patients with symptomatic, bulky, subdiaphragmatic, or progressive HL. In addition, disease that seriously threatens the immediate well-being of the mother (eg, acute airway obstruction, spinal cord compression) requires emergent treatment at any time. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>First trimester</strong> &ndash; For most women with HL diagnosed during the first trimester of pregnancy, we recommend deferral of treatment until the second or third trimester, if possible. Patients with symptomatic or progressive HL that threatens the immediate well-being of the mother require treatment with chemotherapy. For patients who require a rapid tumor response, we suggest combination chemotherapy with ABVD (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a>). For patients who have progressive disease but do not require a rapid tumor response, we also suggest ABVD. Another option for this population is to administer single agent vinblastine with plans to administer combination chemotherapy after delivery. If chemotherapy is necessary within the first trimester, particularly early in the first trimester, termination of the pregnancy may also be discussed, as described below. (See <a href=\"#H1951608\" class=\"local\">'Elective termination of pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Second trimester</strong> &ndash; For most women with limited stage HL diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy, we suggest treatment with combination chemotherapy with ABVD. A subset of patients (ie, asymptomatic, stable, nonbulky, supradiaphragmatic disease) may choose close clinical monitoring with plans to administer chemotherapy after delivery. Radiation therapy may be used for local control of highly symptomatic disease above the diaphragm. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Third trimester</strong> &ndash; For women with HL diagnosed during the third trimester of pregnancy, we suggest deferral of treatment until after delivery, if possible. This allows for a full staging evaluation and selection of appropriate therapy after delivery. However, patients with symptomatic or progressive HL that threatens the immediate well-being of the mother require treatment with chemotherapy. For such patients, we suggest combination chemotherapy with ABVD. </p><p/><p>These treatment choices are described in more detail in the following sections. Despite the increasing availability of guidelines for the treatment of HL, there must remain room for individualization of treatment. In particular, patient preference must be considered with different treatment options, some of which result in a higher recurrence risk at the gain of less toxic initial treatment.</p><p>The issue of pregnancy termination varies with the clinical setting. It is rarely medically indicated with newly diagnosed HL, since even combination chemotherapy (ie, ABVD) has been successfully administered in the first trimester. Similarly, relapse that occurs after radiotherapy alone may be satisfactorily managed with chemotherapy. In contrast, pregnancy termination is often indicated with relapsed HL following combination chemotherapy, since high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support (autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation) is usually the preferred therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1951608\" class=\"local\">'Elective termination of pregnancy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma#H938864865\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351936082\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of patients for deferred therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If possible, therapy for HL should be delayed until at least the second trimester, since the risks of treatment to the fetus are greatest during the first trimester. Some patients may be candidates for further deferral of therapy beyond the first trimester or even until after delivery. This approach is preferred by some clinicians due to the potential teratogenicity of treatment and the indolent clinical nature of many cases of HL. Examples of candidates for further deferral of therapy beyond the first trimester or even until after delivery include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Limited&quot; clinical stage IA or IIA HL presenting during the late second and third trimester (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73699\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73699 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stable &quot;non-urgent&quot; HL diagnosed after 20 weeks gestation</p><p/><p>There have been no prospective trials that have compared deferred therapy with immediate treatment in this setting. It is unknown whether deferral of therapy has an impact on long-term survival rates. Data regarding the safety and efficacy of this approach come from two case series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Stanford group described five women in whom therapy was delayed: three with clinical stage IIA HL, all of whom were in continuous complete remission following successful therapy postdelivery; and two with infradiaphragmatic disease, both of whom died of HL despite therapy postdelivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Canadian group used a minimalist approach to manage 17 women with HL during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Eleven did not require therapy until after delivery and six were managed with single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> during pregnancy. All 17 delivered healthy babies who had a median age of 15 years at last follow-up. Of the 17 women, 13 were alive and in complete remission while four had died (two from HL, one from acute myeloid leukemia, and one from retroperitoneal sarcoma).</p><p/><p>The decision to treat or monitor the pregnant woman with HL must be individualized. Deferral of immediate therapy allows for accurate staging of disease after delivery and treatment based upon disease stage; however, it is unknown whether deferral of therapy impairs disease control and affects survival. If deferral is selected, patients must be monitored closely for progression. Monitoring is easier in patients with disease that is easily assessable with physical examination. Serial abdominal ultrasound can also monitor for the development or progression of subdiaphragmatic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combination chemotherapy offers potentially curative treatment of HL. However, because of concern regarding possible immediate and delayed side effects to the fetus and delivered child, conventional combination chemotherapy has had limited study in the pregnant patient. For most women with HL diagnosed during the first trimester of pregnancy, we recommend deferral of treatment until the second or third trimester, if possible. </p><p>In a comprehensive review of antineoplastic agents and pregnancy, the incidence of fetal malformations was approximately 15 percent after exposure during the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The risk was greatest with alkylating agents and antimetabolites, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> was associated with the lowest risk (one abnormality among 14 patients treated in the first trimester).

Good fetal outcomes were reported following either standard ABVD or single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>. Of these, ABVD was generally preferred because it is a standard of care for patients with HL that appears to have limited fetal toxicity when administered during pregnancy.

Radiation therapy was administered as involved field to the neck (35 Gy) in two, extended field to <span class=\"nowrap\">neck/mediastinum</span> (40 Gy) in three, and full mantle irradiation (40 Gy) in the others. Uterine shielding was maximized by four to five half-value layers of lead. The estimated dose to the fetus was 0.011 to 0.055 Gy with 6 MV photons and 0.10 to 0.14 Gy for cobalt 60. Following delivery, 10 patients had lymphangiography and five underwent staging laparotomy (two with positive findings). Eight patients subsequently had additional radiation therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy. All offspring were reported to be physically and mentally normal and the 10-year survival of the patients was 83 percent.</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a review of 23 patients who received supradiaphragmatic radiation therapy (five in the first trimester) with apparently no harm to the fetus noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Seventeen of these patients (74 percent) had no evidence of HL at the time of the report.</p><p>Fetal outcome following radiotherapy is dependent upon gestational age when radiation is given, whole body fetal dose, and maternal health. A higher frequency of spontaneous abortion and congenital anomaly has not been convincingly demonstrated. Among the series described above, 16 pregnancies resulted in 16 full-term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and 10 pregnancies resulted in one spontaneous abortion in a patient irradiated during the first trimester, three therapeutic abortions, and six normal infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Radiation fields should be designed with measures that will minimize the fetal dose by maximizing the distance between the inferior border of the field and the uterus. Protection of the uterus during radiotherapy should be with 10 HVL shielding. Calculation of the maximal dose to the fetus should be performed prior to treatment and the dose to the fetus should be monitored during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1951608\"><span class=\"h2\">Elective termination of pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to continue or terminate the pregnancy should be individualized and made by a fully informed woman in conjunction with her clinician. Elective termination of the pregnancy is rarely medically indicated with newly diagnosed HL, since even combination chemotherapy has been successfully administered in the first trimester. In contrast, pregnancy termination is often indicated with relapsed HL following combination chemotherapy, since high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support (autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation) is usually the preferred therapy.</p><p>In addition to the usual reasons for pregnancy termination, some factors that should be considered in women with HL during pregnancy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether she is willing to assume a possible risk of fetal toxicity or complications from HL treatment during pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Her prognosis and ability to care for her offspring</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effect of HL treatment on future fertility (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infertility and pregnancy outcome in cancer survivors&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DELIVERY OF THE INFANT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of delivery of the infant must be a joint decision between the obstetrician, hematologist-oncologist, and the patient. Whenever possible, the fetus should be carried to term without compromising the health of the mother or infant. If not, the fetus should be delivered after demonstration of fetal pulmonary maturity and at 34 or more weeks of gestation at which time morbidity of prematurity is relatively low. Cesarean section is not necessary unless obstetrically indicated, and staging laparotomy, performed in conjunction with delivery, is not warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incidence and mortality of the preterm infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The importance of avoiding iatrogenic preterm delivery was illustrated in a multicenter observational study of 70 children who were exposed to maternal cancer staging and treatment during gestation and followed for a median of 22 months (range 17 to 212 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Exposure to chemotherapy during gestation was not associated with increased central nervous system, cardiac, or auditory impairment. However, cognitive development scores were lower for children born preterm, with intelligence quotient increasing by an average of 11.6 points for each additional month of gestation.</p><p>If treatment has been administered prior to delivery, the blood counts of both the mother and the infant should be monitored for the development of cytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/8,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,27</a>]. If possible, no potentially myelosuppressive therapy should be administered within three weeks of delivery. The timing of chemotherapy may also become important prior to delivery since the neonate has a limited ability to metabolize and excrete drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, transient cytopenias have been described in some infants of mothers with lymphoma or leukemia who received chemotherapy within 30 days of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/8,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT AFTER DELIVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have deferred treatment until after delivery can undergo a standard staging evaluation and proceed with treatment as in the nonpregnant patient. Imaging studies performed after chemotherapy or radiation therapy will not provide accurate data regarding the initial stage of disease. As such, patients who receive treatment should proceed with further treatment as if they initially had advanced stage disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>It is recommended that breastfeeding be discontinued once staging and therapy are begun, since contrast and nuclear medicine imaging agents, chemotherapy, and ancillary supportive medications may concentrate in breast milk.
