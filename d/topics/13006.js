The proximate cause is a length-dependent &quot;dying back&quot; axonopathy, primarily involving the distal portions of the longest myelinated and unmyelinated sensory axons, with relative sparing of motor axons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Though distal &quot;dying back&quot; is commonly seen, there is also evidence for proximal nerve dysfunction at the sensory ganglia, which may contribute to this phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, the spinal cord appears to be affected; it is not clear if this is a primary neuropathic involvement of the cord or is due to the diabetes itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is morphologically and functionally indistinguishable from many other &quot;metabolic&quot; neuropathies, including uremic neuropathy and alcoholic neuropathy. However, in diabetic polyneuropathy, morphologic abnormalities of the vaso nervorum are present early in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and parallel the severity of the nerve fiber loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Thus, the morphologic characteristics of diabetic polyneuropathy are consistent with either a vascular or a metabolic etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration and severity of hyperglycemia are major risk factors for the development of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Other investigations have extended the known risk factors to include glycemic variability, age, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>].</p><p>In a clinical trial of 427 patients with diabetic neuropathy, triglycerides were significantly elevated in subjects with progression of their neuropathy over a one year period compared with those whose neuropathy remained stable, independent of glucose control, type of diabetes, or administration of insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These data support the emerging concept that common vascular risk factors are associated with the risk of developing diabetic neuropathy.</p><p>Further evidence of this association comes from the EURODIAB study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among 1172 participants in EURODIAB with type 1 diabetes and no neuropathy at baseline, a distal symmetric polyneuropathy developed over a mean follow-up of 7.3 years in 276 patients (23.5 percent). In addition to duration of diabetes and glycosylated hemoglobin values, the incidence of neuropathy was significantly associated with increased triglyceride levels, body mass index, smoking, and the presence of hypertension at baseline. Several of these risk factors are markers of insulin resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome X)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiovascular disease at baseline was associated with double the risk of neuropathy, independent of cardiovascular risk factors.

This occurs in a fiber-selective pattern that preferentially affects distal sensory and autonomic fibers, leading to the progressive loss of sensation that underlies the clinical manifestations of diabetic polyneuropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71576\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71576 \">table 1</a>). Among the ischemic factors, endothelial dysfunction may be especially important, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism by which lack of glycemic control and cardiovascular factors predisposes to microvascular disease is incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In chronic hyperglycemia, for example, some of the excess glucose combines with amino acids on circulating or tissue proteins. This nonenzymatic process initially forms reversible early glycosylation products and later irreversible advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) via an Amadori rearrangement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F80716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80716 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Serum AGE concentrations are increased in patients with diabetes. These AGE peptides (molecular weight between 2000 and 6000) have strong cross-linking activity with collagen in vitro, which may play a role in the development of diabetic microvascular complications. AGEs bind to the cell surface receptor called RAGE (receptor for AGE). Activation of RAGE is proinflammatory. Other effects of AGEs that also can contribute to vascular injury include increases in vascular permeability, procoagulant activity, adhesion molecule expression, and monocyte influx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Sorbitol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose that enters cells is metabolized in part to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> via the enzyme aldose reductase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81926\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81926 \">figure 2</a>). This process is more pronounced with chronic hyperglycemia. The accumulation of sorbitol within the cells leads to depletion of NADPH, a rise in cell osmolality and a decrease in intracellular myoinositol, all of which interfere with cell metabolism and predispose cells to oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Hexosamine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excess glucose shunts glycolytic intermediates into the hexosamine pathway, producing uridine diphosphate-N-acetyl glucosamine (UDPGlcNAc), a molecule that modifies transcription factors essential for normal cell function.

Oxidative stress provides a unifying mechanism for neural damage and for the onset and progression of diabetic neuropathy. Because different metabolic impairments are tightly interrelated, a vicious feed-forward cycle of altered metabolism, ROS accumulation, and reduced antioxidant defense occurs. This leads to peripheral nerve damage and the signs and symptoms of diabetic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/23,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,36-38</a>].</p><p>In support of a role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy, patients with diabetes who are treated with antioxidants show clinically meaningful improvements in neuropathic symptoms and neuropathic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].

However, the striking predilection of diabetes to damage sensory and autonomic fibers is difficult to explain on the basis of focal endoneurial ischemia.</p><p>These considerations do not exclude an ischemic component to the development of diabetic polyneuropathy, the importance of which is strongly supported by accumulating evidence from animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. As an example, metabolic interventions (eg, inhibitors of protein kinase C activation) that improve nerve conduction also correct the reduced nerve blood flow in diabetic rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Furthermore, retrospective studies have found reduced levels of thrombomodulin and tissue plasminogen activator in peripheral nerve microvessels from patients with diabetes, suggesting that an impairment of antithrombotic mechanisms plays a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic polyneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>Ischemic and metabolic factors may operate together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In addition, there is good evidence that intensive glycemic control reduces the risk of developing diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes and may reduce the risk in patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. In a 2012 systematic review of randomized controlled trials of glycemic control that reported data for the incidence of clinical neuropathy in those without clinical neuropathy at baseline, the following observations were made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In data from two trials involving 1228 subjects with type 1 diabetes, those assigned to enhanced glycemic control had a significantly reduced incidence of clinical neuropathy at five years (8 versus 17 percent, annualized risk difference -1.84 percent, 95% CI -2.56 to -1.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

The ACCORD trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>] contributed approximately 71 percent of the subjects to this analysis.</p><p/><p>The role of glycemic control in the prevention of clinically evident diabetic neuropathy, and in halting its progression, was firmly established for patients with type 1 diabetes by the DCCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/73,74,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74,76</a>]. The DCCT was a multicenter randomized trial that evaluated the effect of intensive versus conventional treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes who did not have advanced diabetic complications. Patients with neuropathy of such severity as to require treatment were excluded from the trial, but patients with abnormal nerve conduction, mild neuropathic symptoms or mild sensory deficits were enrolled. The presence of definite clinical neuropathy was defined by the presence of at least two of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms consistent with diabetic neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory deficits consistent with diabetic neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished or absent reflexes consistent with diabetic neuropathy</p><p/><p>The presence of only one abnormality classified the patient as having possible diabetic neuropathy. The presence of definite neuropathy (two abnormalities) was confirmed by abnormalities in either nerve conduction (abnormalities in at least two anatomically distinct nerves) or cardiovascular autonomic function tests (beat-to-beat heart rate variability or Valsalva ratio).</p><p>At baseline, the patients were stratified into two cohorts based upon the absence (&quot;primary prevention cohort&quot;) or the presence (&quot;secondary intervention cohort&quot;) of background diabetic retinopathy (preproliferative or proliferative retinopathy was an exclusion). Patients in each cohort were evaluated for neuropathy at baseline and randomly assigned to conventional (one to two insulin <span class=\"nowrap\">injections/day)</span> or intensive (three or more insulin <span class=\"nowrap\">injections/day</span> with frequent blood glucose monitoring and follow-up) treatment.</p><p>Neuropathy was reassessed after five years. Intensive insulin treatment, which resulted in hemoglobin A1C values approximately 2 percent lower than conventional treatment, was associated with a 60 to 70 percent reduction in the risk for developing definite neuropathy in patients who did not have it at baseline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70914%7ENEURO%2F50952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70914 graphicRef50952 \">figure 3A-B</a>). This reduction in the development of definite clinical neuropathy was expressed in all three components of this disorder, ie, the clinical examination, nerve conduction studies, and autonomic nerve studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of clinical neuropathy (defined as suggestive findings from the history and physical examination that were confirmed by neurologic testing) was reduced with intensive insulin therapy by 64 percent in the group as a whole (5 versus 13 percent) and 67 percent in the primary prevention cohort (3 versus 10 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive insulin therapy also reduced the incidence of abnormal nerve conduction by 44 percent (26 versus 46 percent) and of autonomic dysfunction by 53 percent (4 versus 9 nine percent).</p><p/><p>Intensive insulin therapy, when initiated early, appears to provide a durable benefit for the prevention of clinically evident neuropathy. The EDIC study followed about 95 percent of subjects in the DCCT cohort after the conclusion of the DCCT study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Subjects who had been in the intensive insulin group of the DCCT were encouraged to maintain intensive therapy, and subjects who had been in the conventional group were encouraged to begin intensive therapy. Despite a narrowing and disappearance of prior glycemic separation, the difference in the prevalence of neuropathy between the DCCT treatment groups persisted over eight years of EDIC follow-up. Prior intensive insulin therapy in the DCCT reduced the odds of neuropathic symptoms and neuropathic signs by 51 and 43 percent, respectively.</p><p>These data clearly establish that improved metabolic control markedly reduces the risk of developing diabetic neuropathy, both somatic and autonomic, in patients with type 1 diabetes. The Oslo study suggested that there was a graded effect of hyperglycemia on disease progression because each 1 percent rise in hemoglobin A1C values was associated with a 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> slowing of nerve conduction at eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, these and other observations suggest, but do not prove, that improved metabolic control would have equally potent effects on the prevention of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>While not as robust, findings from the UKPDS trial support the idea that glycemic control may be important in the prevention of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. In the UKPDS, 3867 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes received either intensive treatment (insulin or an oral agent) or conventional treatment with diet. After 10 years, patients on intensive treatment had a 25 percent risk reduction in microvascular complications (ie, retinopathy and nephropathy). Most of this reduction was driven by the retinopathy endpoint. Trends, but not statistically significant differences, were present in neuropathic endpoints at year 10. However, at year 15, sensory perception in the legs was significantly preserved by intensive versus conventional treatment, with neuropathy present in 31.2 versus 51.7 percent (relative risk reduction 60 percent, 95% CI 0.39-0.94), although this was in a smaller cohort of less than 250 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular risk factor treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association of vascular risk factors with diabetic neuropathy (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above) suggests that treating dyslipidemia and hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors could slow or prevent the progression of diabetic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

The proximate cause is a length-dependent &quot;dying back&quot; axonopathy, primarily involving the distal portions of the longest myelinated and unmyelinated sensory axons, with relative sparing of motor axons. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Morphology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The duration and severity of hyperglycemia are major risk factors for the development of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Additional risk factors include dyslipidemia, hypertension, and smoking. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In diabetes, a complex array of metabolic, vascular, and perhaps hormonal factors shift the balance between nerve fiber damage and nerve fiber repair in favor of the former. This occurs in a fiber-selective pattern that preferentially affects distal sensory and autonomic fibers, leading to the progressive loss of sensation that underlies the clinical manifestations of diabetic polyneuropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71576\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71576 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve ischemia has been invoked in the pathogenesis of diabetic polyneuropathy because of the presence of thickened endoneurial blood vessel walls and vascular occlusions at autopsy. This is supported by morphological and clinical evidence. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Role of ischemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved metabolic control markedly reduces the risk of developing diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes and may be useful for the prevention of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dyck PJ, Kratz KM, Karnes JL, et al.
