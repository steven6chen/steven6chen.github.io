Urothelial (transitional cell) carcinomas of the renal pelvis account for approximately 8 percent of kidney tumors, and other parenchymal epithelial tumors, such as oncocytomas, collecting duct tumors, and renal sarcomas, are rare. Nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor) is common in children (5 to 6 percent of pediatric malignancies).

Either of these findings constitutes stage IV RCC. (See <a href=\"#H1056314147\" class=\"local\">'Advanced RCC'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>An overview of the approach to treatment is presented here; more detailed discussions of specific aspects of treatment are discussed in other topics, as noted below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1056311476\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCALIZED RCC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) present with localized disease, definitive therapy can often be curative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1056311484\"><span class=\"h2\">Definitive treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is curative in the majority of patients with RCC who do not have metastases. Surgery is therefore the preferred treatment for patients with stages I, II, and III disease.</p><p>Treatment may require a radical nephrectomy, although a partial nephrectomy to preserve renal parenchyma is preferred for appropriately selected patients. The choice of surgical procedure depends upon the extent of disease, as well as patient-specific factors such as age and comorbidity. Surgery may be carried out through a conventional approach or by a minimally-invasive approach such as laparoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitive surgical management of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In carefully selected patients who present with a resectable primary tumor and a concurrent single metastasis, surgical resection of the metastasis, in conjunction with radical nephrectomy, may be curative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-surgery-in-patients-with-metastatic-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of surgery in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other ablative procedures (eg, cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation [RFA]) may be an important alternative for patients with relatively small renal masses who are not surgical candidates.

In these situations, we recommend surgery. Proper management should include sparing as much renal parenchyma as possible during the initial therapy and monitoring for the development of additional RCCs.

Although nonsurgical procedures (eg, cryoablation, RFA) may be useful, most small tumors grow slowly and do not become symptomatic or metastasize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].

There are no data on checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy following resection of high-risk RCC, although phase III studies with T cell checkpoint inhibitors are underway.

All patients had pT2 grade 3 or 4 disease, pT3 or T4 disease of any grade, or N1 lymph node involvement, and all were free of metastases. Initially, 403 patients were randomized to pazopanib at a dose of 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or placebo.

At a median follow-up of 5.4 years, DFS, the primary endpoint of the trial, was significantly increased in those receiving sunitinib (median 6.8 versus 5.6 years, 59.3 versus 51.3 percent disease-free at five years, HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.95). At the time of data cutoff, data were not mature enough to evaluate overall survival, a secondary endpoint of the trial, although the number of deaths in the two treatment arms was equal. Toxicity was significantly increased with sunitinib compared with placebo, the most common serious side effects being palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and hypertension. Although sunitinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adjuvant therapy based on these results, its use is not recommended due to the failure to demonstrate improvement in overall survival.</p><p/><p>Another large phase III trial using girentuximab (an antibody targeting carbonic anhydrase IX) failed to demonstrate any benefit in either DFS or overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The response to therapy of patients who relapse is best in patients with a good performance status and a limited tumor burden. Furthermore, some patients who have a solitary recurrence may be cured with surgical metastasectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance for metastatic disease after definitive treatment for renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1056314147\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANCED RCC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) are clinically silent for much of their natural history. Thus, the diagnosis is frequently not made until disease is locally advanced (and unresectable) or has metastasized. In addition, many patients who initially are resectable eventually recur. Systemic therapy (immunotherapy, molecularly targeted agents), surgery, and radiation all may have a role depending upon the extent of disease, sites of involvement, and patient-specific factors.</p><p>The choice of treatment for patients with advanced disease should consider prognostic risk factors. The International Metastatic Renal-Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium prognostic model integrates six adverse factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F116130\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116130 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &lt;80 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time from diagnosis to treatment &lt;1 year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin concentration &lt;lower limit of normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum calcium &gt;upper limit of normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutrophil count &gt;upper limit of normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet count &gt;upper limit of normal</p><p/><p>Patients with none of these risk factors are considered good risk, those with one or two are considered intermediate risk, and those with three or more risk factors are considered poor risk.</p><p>In general, systemic therapy is initiated promptly when unresectable disease, either metastatic or locally advanced disease, is present. However, for asymptomatic patients with a limited disease burden and no poor prognostic features, close active surveillance may represent an alternative for those wanting to defer the initiation of therapy and its attendant toxicity until more compelling disease progression is documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H350647569\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic therapy of clear cell RCC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors and molecularly targeted therapy are the primary systemic modalities for the management of patients whose disease is not controlled by definitive locoregional therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F104172\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104172 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F116262\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116262 \">algorithm 2</a>).
