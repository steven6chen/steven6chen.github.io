Chronic exposure to modest levels of lead, too low to trigger symptoms, can increase risk for hypertension and can accelerate future cognitive and renal decline in adults.</p><p>Clinicians need to take a proactive role in early detection and prevention by screening patients known to work in occupations with possible lead exposure, and need to know what actions to take when excessive exposure is found. The costs and consequences of lead poisoning can be dramatically reduced if not entirely prevented by eliminating and decreasing sources of exposures and by early recognition of elevated lead levels or lead poisoning.</p><p>This topic will focus on occupational lead poisoning, primarily in the United States &#160;.

The 2007 to 2008 survey also reported higher prevalence rates of elevated BLL in adult males compared with females, and among non-Hispanic blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sources of exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of adult elevated BLL come from workplace exposures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53953 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Exposure can occur in numerous work settings, such as manufacturing or use of batteries, pigments, solder, ammunitions, paint, car radiators, cable and wires, some cosmetics, ceramic ware with lead glazes, and tin cans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Primary and secondary lead smelting and refinement are associated with considerable exposure. Mass lead intoxication has been reported for both children and adults living around and working in lead battery <span class=\"nowrap\">manufacturing/recycling</span> plants and artisanal gold mining, particularly in low-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].</p><p>Other sources of exposure include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gasoline</strong> &ndash; An organic form of lead (tetraethyl lead) was added to gasoline to raise the octane level and to serve as an &quot;antiknock&quot; agent in the 1920s. It has been estimated that 90 percent of atmospheric lead originated from automobile exhaust and accounted for the increase in environmental lead concentrations observed between the 1930s and 1960s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60319\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60319 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The introduction of lead-free gasoline in the 1980s contributed to a considerable decrease in air lead levels in the United States and consequently BLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. Use of leaded gasoline has declined worldwide, particularly in the industrialized countries, but it is still used in aviation and racing cars and may still be used in conventional automobiles in some countries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paint</strong> &ndash; The use of lead paint has resulted in lead exposures at work in the construction trades, as well as in the home, thereby posing a lead poisoning risk to children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The lead content of paint in the United States was unregulated until 1977. In 2000, it was estimated that about one million construction workers in the United States were occupationally exposed to lead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition to coating residential properties, lead paint also covers five billion square feet of nonresidential surface area in the United States, including 89 percent of the nation's steel bridges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Lead from paint can also enter the environment and increase soil lead levels when natural disasters destroy homes as in the case of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moonshine</strong> &ndash; In some parts of the United States, illegally distilled alcohol (&quot;moonshine&quot;) is an important source of lead exposure. In a study from an emergency department in Atlanta, the median blood lead level in drinkers of moonshine was significantly higher than in nondrinkers, 11.0 versus 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.53 versus 0.12 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L);</span> the percentage of patients with BLL &ge;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (1.21 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> was higher as well (25.7 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bullets</strong> &ndash; Lead exposure can also occur at indoor and outdoor firing ranges due to the use of leaded bullets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Consuming wild game may also lead to lead exposure if the game was hunted using lead bullets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cosmetics</strong> &ndash; Litargirio (also known as litharge or lead monoxide), a lead-based powder sold and used in some Hispanic communities as an <span class=\"nowrap\">antiperspirant/deodorant</span> and as a folk remedy, has also caused lead poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], as has the use of tiro, an eye cosmetic from Nigeria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Herbal <span class=\"nowrap\">remedies/supplements</strong></span> &ndash; Lead poisoning has occurred in those taking Ayurvedic medications (a tradition of alternative medicine with roots in the Indian subcontinent), including during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. Women who reported using herbal supplements had BLL 10 percent higher than non-users, although mean lead levels were low in both groups (&lt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [0.97 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

A study performed by the Wisconsin Division of Public health found that patients are at risk for substantial lead exposure during a dental radiograph if the office stores the films in these boxes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other</strong> &ndash; Lead has also been found as an adulterant in marijuana [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], candy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], lipstick [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], and other consumer products. Lead contamination is a risk that can be associated with a wide variety of production processes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGIC BASIS FOR DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absorption and tissue distribution</strong> &ndash; Inorganic lead is absorbed from the lungs or gastrointestinal (GI) tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F99977\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99977 \">figure 2</a>). In adults, absorption of lead via the respiratory tract is the most significant route of entry, with an average absorption rate of approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Respiratory exposures can occur with activities such as scraping, sanding, or burning leaded paint from surfaces as well as from various <span class=\"nowrap\">smelting/burning</span> processes. Organic (tetraethyl) lead that is found in gasoline can be absorbed via the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The efficacy of GI absorption of lead in adults is about less than 8 to 10 percent and is increased during fasting or when diets are deficient in calcium, iron, phosphorous, or zinc. Although GI absorption is not the major route for adults, it can be a significant contributor, particularly when working <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eating in a lead-contaminated environment. GI absorption is the predominate route in children and is more efficient, estimated to be around 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once absorbed, lead is distributed to the blood, soft tissues, and skeleton (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F99977\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99977 \">figure 2</a>). In blood, 99 percent of lead is bound to the erythrocyte and the remaining 1 percent is free in the plasma to exchange with soft tissues (kidney, brain, liver, bone marrow) and cross the placenta. Lead in blood is excreted via the kidneys and cleared comparatively fast, with a mean half-life of about 30 days if renal function is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, blood clearance can be slower in people with a long history of lead exposure and large bone stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lead in the skeleton has a half-life of decades and contains approximately 95 percent of the body burden of lead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Lead can be released from this bone reservoir during times of bone turnover, such as during hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], menopause, pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], and breast feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biochemical mechanisms of toxicity</strong> &ndash; Lead is a toxic metal that affects many functions and organ systems in humans, with multiple biochemical mechanisms of toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/2,7,13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,13,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lead is an electropositive metal whose affinity for negatively charged sulfhydryl groups leads to binding to and inhibition of sulfhydryl-dependent enzymes such as delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (delta-ALAD) and ferrochelatase, which are critical to heme synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This disruption of hemoglobin synthesis leads to the production of free erythrocyte protoporphyrins (FEP), which can be measured. Anemia can develop at very high blood lead levels (BLL; usually greater than 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">ug/dL)</span>. In addition, lead inhibition of pyrimidine 5' nucleotidase can cause degradation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) in red blood cells that can lead to the appearance of basophilic stippling on a peripheral smear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Divalent lead may also compete with calcium in several biologic systems, such as mitochondrial respiration and various nerve functions. Lead's interference with several calcium dependent processes and activation of protein kinase C has been implicated as a contributing mechanism in lead neurotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lead alters the permeability of the blood brain barrier and accumulates in astroglia, cells essential for maintenance of the neuronal environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lead can also affect the nucleic acids deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) by mechanisms not yet fully understood.

However, other studies have shown inconsistent polymorphism relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].

The timing of the symptoms, changes in frequency or intensity, and relationship to any changes or recent exposure conditions is helpful information. It is also important to note the past history of lead exposure on previous jobs, or childhood lead poisoning.

Measuring lead in urine, hair, or other media is not as accurate or reliable and does not correlate as well with adverse health effects. The BLL is a good indicator of exposure that has occurred within the previous few weeks. A single BLL reflects both recent exposure to exogenous sources and the release of endogenous lead from bone and soft tissue stores. In interpreting the results, it is important to use levels appropriate to adult toxicity, rather than childhood toxicity (which sometimes are the ranges of concern reported by the testing laboratories).</p><p>For routine monitoring of occupational exposure to lead, venous blood sampling is preferable to earlobe capillary blood sampling. Surface skin contamination can result in false elevations in the lead level in sampled capillary blood even after the area is cleaned with an alcohol wipe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p>In research studies, a cumulative blood lead index (CBLI) is sometimes calculated to assess cumulative, chronic exposure to lead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. The test is highly correlated with bone lead levels. However, clinical management of the lead-exposed adult is based on BLL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2474935743\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The other core laboratory tests that measure lead effects are the free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) or zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP), complete blood count with blood smear morphology, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and urinalysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adult-occupational-lead-poisoning/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>].</p><p>We approach laboratory testing (in addition to BLL) as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If BLL is &gt;25, measure the FEP or ZPP. Both measure the effect of lead on inhibition of enzymes involved in hemoglobin synthesis, and therefore either can be used as an indicator of lead exposure (and effect) over the preceding three-month period (determined by the average 120-day lifespan of the erythrocyte). BLL &le;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> does not inhibit the enzymes of hemoglobin synthesis sufficiently to result in much of a measurable increase in ZPP or FEP, which is one reason those tests are no longer used for screening and are also not necessary (unless mandated by regulations) for lower BLL. However, if there is concern that recent past exposure may be higher than the BLL indicates, checking a FEP or ZPP may be reasonable even if BLL is &le;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If either the blood lead or FEP is elevated, additional tests to assess potential effects of lead on blood (complete blood count [CBC] with smear) and the kidneys (serum creatinine, urinalysis) should be performed. Blood smear morphology should also be obtained in the setting of anemia. We generally do not perform smear morphology for routine screening (given that abnormalities in the smear would be associated only with high lead levels and are not specific).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum BUN and creatinine should be measured. However, it is important to note that the serum creatinine is not a sensitive indicator of renal damage since it does not rise substantially in patients with normal baseline values until over 50 percent of kidney function is lost.
