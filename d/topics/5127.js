It affects people with diabetes. It is most common in people who do not control their blood sugar well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10100370\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with diabetic retinopathy have no symptoms until the disease is very advanced. By then, it is usually too late to do anything about the vision loss. That's why it is important to get screened for the condition early. That way, doctors can take steps to protect your eyes before your vision is damaged.</p><p>When symptoms start, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurry vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dark or floating spots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63624\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63624 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble seeing things that are at the center of your focus when reading or driving</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble telling colors apart</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10100377\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for diabetic retinopathy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for diabetic retinopathy, eye doctors can do 1 of 2 main tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dilated eye exam</strong> &ndash; During this exam, the eye doctor gives you eye drops to make your pupils open up. (The drops make it easier for the doctor to see the different parts of the inside of your eye.) After the drops have done their job, the doctor looks at the back of your eye, called the retina. That's the part of the eye that is damaged by diabetic retinopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Digital retinal imaging</strong> &ndash; For this test, a technician takes pictures of the eye with a special camera. Then he or she sends the pictures to an eye doctor, who checks for disease. It is OK to use this test if your past eye tests have all been normal or if you have no eye doctors nearby. Otherwise, you should have a dilated eye exam.</p><p/><p>If either the dilated eye exam or the digital retinal imaging test shows a problem, the eye doctor might suggest other tests, too.</p><p>People with diabetes should have their eyes checked regularly. If you have retinopathy, you will need to get checked at least once a year, maybe more. If not, you might only need to get checked every few years. Your doctor will work with you to decide on a schedule. Ideally, checkups should include a dilated eye exam done by an eye doctor. (People who have had normal eye exams in the past and do not have an eye doctor nearby can instead have digital retinal imaging.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For people with type 1 diabetes, yearly eye exams should start 3 to 5 years after diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For people with type 2 diabetes, yearly eye exams should start right after diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10100384\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you notice any vision loss (or dark spots in your vision), see an eye doctor as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10100391\"><span class=\"h1\">How is diabetic retinopathy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When mild, diabetic retinopathy is not always treated. But people with the condition do need to keep their blood sugar and blood pressure levels as close to normal as possible. This helps keep the condition from getting worse.</p><p>Treatments for diabetic retinopathy can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Photocoagulation</strong> &ndash; This is laser surgery to seal or destroy leaking or growing blood vessels in the retina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vitrectomy</strong> &ndash; This is surgery to remove blood from the part of the eye called the &quot;vitreous humor&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76735\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76735 \">figure 1</a>). Doctors do this surgery if the blood vessels in the retina leak into the vitreous humor. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines</strong> &ndash; Medicines that are injected into the vitreous humor are sometimes used along with photocoagulation or vitrectomy. Your eye doctor will let you know if this type of treatment will help you. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10100398\"><span class=\"h1\">Can diabetic retinopathy be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have diabetes, you can reduce your chances of getting diabetic retinopathy by keeping your blood sugar and blood pressure levels as close to normal as possible. It might also be important to keep cholesterol levels in the normal range.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10100405\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-vision-loss-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Age-related vision loss (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-macular-degeneration-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Age-related macular degeneration (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataracts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cataracts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-angle-glaucoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Open-angle glaucoma (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preventing complications in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
