The incidence of any rejection between discharge and one year has decreased from 30 percent for primary transplants in 2004 to 2006 to 25 percent in 2010 to 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Acute cellular rejection is most likely to occur in the first three to six months, with the incidence declining significantly after this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The diagnosis of acute cellular cardiac allograft rejection is generally made by endomyocardial biopsy performed either routinely or because of suggestive symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">ISHLT grading system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endomyocardial biopsy is graded using the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) nomenclature adopted in 1990 and revised in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

The dose and duration of therapy are discussed below for the different types of rejection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of action of steroids in reversing acute rejection is incompletely understood. The major immunosuppressive action of corticosteroids is to inhibit the synthesis of almost all known cytokines. Steroids appear to act by inducing the synthesis of IkBa, a protein that traps free nuclear factor kappa B, an activator of cytokine genes and mediator of the proinflammatory action of tumor necrosis factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. High-dose &ldquo;pulse&rdquo; corticosteroids may more effectively impair cytokine generation. </p><p>In transplant rejection, steroids act in part by suppressing the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) by macrophages. This in turn leads to diminished production of IL-2 by activated T cells, thereby lessening the entire cellular immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Inhibition of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma may also be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, they induce lymphocytolysis in some animal species; it is not known if this occurs in humans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Antithymocyte globulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antithymocyte globulin is prepared by immunizing rabbits (Thymoglobulin) or horses (ATGAM) with human lymphoid cells derived from the thymus or cultured B cell lines. Antithymocyte globulins reverse rejection through a variety of effects. Most important is cell death by complement-dependent lysis or Fc receptor-mediated lysis and opsonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Disadvantages of using such polyclonal antilymphocyte preparations include lot-to-lot variability, cumbersome production and purification, nonselective targeting of all lymphocytes, and the need to administer the medication via central venous access.</p><p>There are no comparative data of Thymoglobulin and ATGAM in heart transplant recipients. However, trials in renal transplant recipients suggest that Thymoglobulin is preferred because of a significant reduction in the rate of acute rejection and a significant increase in allograft survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults#H1591813566\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;, section on 'rATG-Thymoglobulin versus IL-2 receptor antibodies'</a>.)</p><p>CD3 count monitoring as a means to adjust antithymocyte globulin dose has been found to result in lower doses and reduced costs in renal transplantation patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and limited data suggest this approach is also helpful in cardiac transplant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The side effects of both Thymoglobulin and ATGAM include allergic and immune reactions and increased susceptibility to infection, especially with cytomegalovirus (CMV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serum sickness reaction, characterized by fever, chills, arthralgias, and, on occasion, frank arthritis, occurs in many patients during the initial infusion. However, anaphylactic reactions, including respiratory distress and hypotension, are exceedingly rare.<br/><br/>To minimize the allergic manifestations, patients are usually pretreated with a cocktail of corticosteroids, antihistamines, and antipyretics. In addition, some centers routinely screen for an allergic response to either drug by administering a skin test one hour prior to administering the full dose if the test is negative. Patients with known allergies to rabbits or horses should not receive Thymoglobulin or ATGAM, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pruritic skin rash (20 percent) and presumed antiplatelet antibody-induced thrombocytopenia of varying severity (50 percent) can occur late in the course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17</a>]. An antibody-mediated leukopenia may also be seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antithymocyte globulins can induce both CMV and herpes infections. These infections are rarely life threatening, and can usually be avoided with prophylactic antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylaxis of infections in solid organ transplantation&quot;, section on 'Cytomegalovirus'</a>.)<br/><br/>Antithymocyte globulins do not generally induce a host antibody response to the rabbit or horse serum (in contrast to the response to the murine monoclonal antibody OKT3). As a result, there is a greater opportunity for successful readministration if necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Monoclonal OKT3 antibody</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OKT3 is a murine monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD3 antigen that closely surrounds the T-cell surface. OKT3 inhibits T-cell function by a number of mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. It appears to clear or downregulate CD3 positive cells by attaching to the CD3-T cell receptor complex, which leads to shedding or internalization of the CD3-T cell receptor complex. The net effect is that these lymphocytes no longer carry T-cell receptors and their response to antigens is blunted. OKT3 can also cause opsonization.</p><p>The use of OKT3 is associated with a number of important side effects and is not generally used in most clinical rejection episodes. These include a cytokine-mediated first-dose reaction and an increased incidence of infection, including lymphoproliferative disease associated with Epstein Barr virus infection, and pulmonary edema. The first-dose reaction includes fever (70 to 100 percent); rigors (30 percent); nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (15 to 20 percent); hypotension and chest pain, dyspnea, or wheezing (10 to 20 percent). Steroids, antihistamines, and antipyretics are usually given prior to OKT3 to minimize these side effects, all of which should decrease with repeated exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR ACUTE REJECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of therapy used to treat an acute rejection episode depends upon the histologic severity, the degree of hemodynamic compromise <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms, and the number of rejections immediately preceding the rejection to be treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic compromise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemodynamic compromise is defined as one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in cardiac output (&lt;4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min)</span> or cardiac index (&lt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> per m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decrease in pulmonary artery saturation (&lt;50 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevation in pulmonary artery or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.</p><p/><p>In addition, the presence of new symptoms of profound fatigue or dyspnea (ie, heart failure symptoms) in association with cellular rejection has often been interpreted to represent hemodynamic compromise as well.</p><p>Therapy varies with the pathologic grade and the presence or absence of hemodynamic compromise. According to the revised 2004 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) grading system, grade 1 R includes grades 1A, 1B, and 2 in the 1990 system; grade 2 R was grade 3A; and grade 3 R was grades 3B and 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'ISHLT grading system'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Grade 1 R</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Grade 1 R rejection (grades 1A, 1B, and 2 in the 1990 system) is generally not treated unless there is concomitant hemodynamic dysfunction since corticosteroid therapy does not increase the likelihood of resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In one study of patients with focal moderate (grade 2 in the 1990 system) rejection, for example, resolution occurred in 85 percent of patients treated with corticosteroids compared to 87 percent of those who were not treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>However, another report suggested that the outcome of grade 2 rejection, even late after transplantation, was not necessarily benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Grade 2 rejection was the strongest predictor of the development grade 3A (now grade 2 R) or higher rejection on a subsequent biopsy, with an odds ratio of 2.4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Therapy for mild or focal moderate rejection associated with hemodynamic compromise includes high-dose corticosteroids or antibody therapy, depending upon the severity of hemodynamic compromise. A typical regimen is to administer oral pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for three to five days) in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; an alternative is intravenous pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for three days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

A typical regimen is to administer oral pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for three to five days) in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; an alternative is intravenous pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for three days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The patient is generally returned to the oral steroid dose he or she was taking after the high-dose regimen is completed. Gradual steroid tapering has been recommended in the past but offers no clinical advantage. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> doses are only changed if the blood levels are subtherapeutic.</p><p>Repeat endomyocardial biopsies are typically obtained on a weekly basis for the subsequent two weeks after the high-dose steroids are given to verify histologic resolution of rejection. Approximately 80 to 85 percent of these rejection episodes respond to the initial corticosteroid regimen. Resolution of rejection was defined as a subsequent biopsy of grade 2 (single focus of dense mononuclear cell infiltrate with myocyte injury) or less in the 1990 system without hemodynamic compromise.</p><p>A second regimen of intravenous pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> may be given for three days if the endomyocardial biopsy shows persistent rejection, but multiple other agents are being evaluated. These include antithymocyte globulin, photopheresis, switching from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, and addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>.

Either antithymocyte globulin or OKT3 can be used. Antithymocyte globulin is generally preferred since there is a less intense cytokine reaction than with OKT3; it is also preferred for those patients who have already received OKT3 induction therapy during the immediate post-transplant period to keep total OKT3 exposure below 75 mg.</p><p>Calcineurin inhibitors and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> <strong>mofetil</strong> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>) are continued at their pretreatment doses if therapeutic levels have been achieved.

Tacrolimus is increasingly used as the primary immunosuppressive. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> at a dose of 500 mg is given as premedication on day one in lieu of standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> doses. Antihistamines and antipyretics are also given on day one.</p><p>This regimen reverses 80 to 95 percent of rejection episodes. Endomyocardial biopsies are usually obtained at the end of the course and then one week later to verify both resolution of rejection and the absence of recurrence. The patient is returned to the usual regimen of routine surveillance biopsies if these goals are achieved. The management of persistent rejection is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Resistant or recurrent rejection'</a> below.)</p><p>Therapy for rejection should be <strong>modified or stopped</strong> prior to completion of the full course of antibody therapy if the patient has a documented infection with resolution of rejection on endomyocardial biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Issues related to use of OKT3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual dose of OKT3 is 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> intravenously for 10 to 14 days. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>) are usually continued at their pretreatment doses if therapeutic levels have been achieved.

Antihistamines, antipyretics, and diuretics are also given as premedications on day one.</p><p>Patients treated with OKT3 should undergo CD3 testing to assess its efficacy. This is usually performed at baseline and then three to five days after the initiation of therapy. OKT3 should lead to a fall in CD3 positive cells in the peripheral blood as determined by flow cytometry. The goal is to reduce the number of CD3+ cells below 5 percent of the total number of leukocytes or below a total absolute number of 50 at four days.</p><p>OKT3 administration induces human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) at titers &gt;1:100 in approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients. The main risk of HAMA is that they may blunt the effect of the drug; allergic IgE-mediated reactions have not been reported. Thus, screening for HAMA should be performed prior to any <strong>recurrent</strong> use of OKT3. The following general recommendations apply to recurrent OKT3 use and HAMA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OKT3 can be given at the usual dose if HAMA are absent or if low antibody titers (&lt;1:100) are present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OKT3 can be given in higher dose (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or antithymocyte globulin can be substituted if higher HAMA titers are obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic and antiviral prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic and antiviral prophylaxis should be given to any patient treated with high-dose steroids or antilymphocyte therapy.

If there are histologic findings of severe AMR <strong>and</strong> immunopathologic findings, the grade is 3 (severe pathologic AMR). </p><p/><p>AMR often occurs during the first month after transplantation, in association with antidonor antibodies, and can occur as early as two to seven days, if the recipient is presensitized to donor HLA antigens, or as late as months to years after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>].</p><p>AMR is typically more severe hemodynamically than the more common T-cell mediated cellular rejection. Graft dysfunction is present in approximately two-thirds of early AMR episodes, with hemodynamic compromise (shock, hypotension, decreased cardiac output, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a rise pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) in approximately one-half of AMR episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/27,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,30</a>]. In comparison, graft dysfunction is uncommon (10 to 15 percent) with late episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>AMR is associated with a worse prognosis than cellular rejection, as illustrated in a review of 587 patients at a single center: 19 percent of rejection episodes were due to humoral rejection alone, 60 percent to cellular rejection alone, and 23 percent to mixed cellular and vascular rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The following findings were noted in the patients with AMR:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significantly higher rate of overall mortality (64 versus 30 and 39 percent with cellular and mixed rejection).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significantly higher rate of graft loss due to acute rejection (15 versus 2.5 and 2 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significantly higher rate of graft loss due to transplant vasculopathy than cellular rejection (15.7 versus 5.7 percent); the rate was also increased (15 percent) in patients with mixed rejection.</p><p/><p>The optimal therapy of AMR is not well defined, and it is not clear whether treatment should only be initiated in those patients with graft dysfunction and histologic features of AMR listed above. A small study suggested that the outcome in patients with antibody-mediated rejection severe enough to produce hemodynamic compromise may be improved by plasmapheresis in combination with corticosteroids and antilymphocyte antibodies (antithymocyte globulin or OKT3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In this study, the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> for maintenance therapy did not prevent further episodes of humoral rejection. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Photopheresis'</a> below.) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a>, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20 that is found on the surface of B cells, is increasingly used in addition to the above therapies, to treat AMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANT OR RECURRENT REJECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to resistant or recurrent acute rejection depends upon the clinical setting. Rebound rejection can occur shortly after OKT3 or antithymocyte globulin; these episodes can be treated with corticosteroids. If the patient fails to respond, then another course of antibody therapy can be given.</p><p>Alternative approaches can be used in the patient who has received two or three courses of OKT3 or antithymocyte globulin. These include photopheresis, total lymphoid irradiation, and changes in the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. Several reports have emphasized the utility of photopheresis for reversal of recalcitrant rejection or reduction of the frequency of rejection, because it is often effective and has few side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Photopheresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photopheresis, also called photochemotherapy, was first developed as immunotherapy for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and has also been applied to the autoimmune diseases scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis. It involves ex vivo separation of leukocytes from erythrocytes and exposure of the leukocytes to 8-methoxypsoralen and ultraviolet light. The leukocytes that are rapidly proliferating (such as T-cells responding to alloantigens) are preferentially damaged. The damaged cells are returned to the patient and presumably induce counterimmune responses such as T-cell vaccination. Photopheresis is usually performed twice per week for four weeks.</p><p>When given to reverse cardiac transplant rejection, photopheresis appears to be as effective as high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> without the side effects of corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Photopheresis has also been successful in several reports in reversing refractory rejection and in reducing the frequency of recurrence of rejection in patients who are frequent rejectors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. One report, for example, described four patients with refractory grade 3A to 4 cardiac allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Three patients showed complete histologic reversal of rejection after photopheresis on two successive days. Complete recovery was more gradual in the fourth patient, occurring after three two-day treatments.</p><p>Photopheresis may also have a role for prophylaxis against rejection when used in combination with other therapies. As an example, one study randomized 60 recipients of primary cardiac transplants to standard triple therapy consisting of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, or triple therapy in conjunction with 24 photopheresis treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. After six months, the number of episodes of acute rejection per patient was significantly reduced by photopheresis compared to conventional therapy alone (0.91 versus 1.44) and significantly more patients in the photopheresis had no or only one rejection (82 versus 52 percent). There was no significant difference in survival at 6 and 12 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Total lymphoid irradiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total lymphoid irradiation (at a dose of 30 Gy) has been used to treat recalcitrant cardiac and renal transplant rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

The regimen is related to the histologic severity of the rejection episode and the patient's hemodynamic status. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'ISHLT grading system'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 R (grade 1A, 1B, or 2 in the 1990 system) cellular rejection episodes are not treated if the patient is hemodynamically stable. Concomitant hemodynamic compromise, as defined above, necessitates treatment with either high-dose corticosteroids or, for profound hemodynamic compromise, antithymocyte globulin or OKT3. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic compromise'</a> above.)<br/><br/>A typical steroid regimen is to administer oral pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for three to five days) or intravenous pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for three days). The patient is generally returned to the oral steroid dose he or she was taking after the high-dose regimen is completed. Gradual steroid tapering to the maintenance dose has been recommended in the past but offers no clinical advantage. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) doses are only changed if the blood levels are subtherapeutic.

If two courses of therapy do not reverse the rejection, then antithymocyte globulin or OKT3 should be administered. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Grade 2 R without hemodynamic compromise'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Antithymocyte globulin is generally preferred since there is a less intense cytokine reaction than with OKT3; it is also preferred in patients who have already received OKT3 induction therapy during the immediate post-transplant period to keep total OKT3 exposure below 75 mg. Corticosteroid premedication with methylprednisolone (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> intravenously) is given on day one in lieu of the standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> doses.
