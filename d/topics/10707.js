Ventilatory strategies vary according to the clinical scenario, and to provide optimal care, emergency clinicians must understand the fundamental concepts of mechanical ventilation.</p><p>This topic review will discuss concepts needed to manage mechanical ventilation in the ED, including ventilator settings, modes of mechanical ventilation, complications of mechanical ventilation, management of ventilated patients in distress, general and disease-specific ventilation strategies, and weaning from ventilatory support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Although useful guidelines are provided, clinicians will need to individualize mechanical ventilation strategies based upon the clinical scenario. Tracheal intubation and other aspects of airway management are discussed elsewhere.

The ventilator or the patient triggers the initiation of inspiration.</p><p>2. The ventilator provides a breath, determined by preset variables (eg, pressure, volume, and flow rate). </p><p>3. The ventilator halts inspiration when a preset parameter, such as tidal volume, inspiratory time, or airway pressure, is reached.</p><p>4. The ventilator switches to expiration and the breath is completed. Expiration occurs when the expiratory valve opens, and generally involves a passive mechanism generated by the recoil of the chest wall, lungs, and diaphragm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">VENTILATOR SETTINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To provide the benefits of mechanical ventilation, emergency clinicians must be familiar with the ventilator apparatus in use at their hospital and understand the various settings that can be modified. In this section, basic ventilator settings of importance to the emergency clinician are described. More detailed discussions of mechanical ventilation settings are found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ventilator settings are adjusted to provide adequate minute ventilation to meet metabolic demand, while minimizing the risk of iatrogenic complications. Minute ventilation (MV) equals tidal volume multiplied by respiratory rate (MV = TV x RR). Normal MV ranges from 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>. The basal ventilatory rate is selected by the clinician. Tidal volume is generally based on ideal body weight and varies according to the ventilation mode chosen. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Modes of ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breath types &ndash; Mechanical ventilators can deliver different kinds of breaths. A mandatory breath is started, controlled, and ended by the ventilator, which does all the work. An assisted breath is initiated by the patient, but controlled and ended by the ventilator. A spontaneous breath is initiated, controlled, and ended by the patient; the volume of the breath delivered by the ventilator is determined by the patient&rsquo;s effort and physiologic reserve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Types of breaths'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triggers &ndash; An assisted breath can be triggered by either pressure or flow. The former requires a demand valve, which senses a negative airway pressure deflection when the patient initiates a breath. A trigger sensitivity threshold of -1 to -3 cmH2O is common. When the threshold is reached, the ventilator delivers a breath. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Trigger'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The flow trigger uses a circuit of gas that flows continuously past the patient. A preset change in flow rate, created when the patient initiates a breath, triggers the ventilator to deliver a breath. A basal flow rate of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> is common, and a trigger sensitivity threshold of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> is frequently used. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Regardless of the trigger mechanism, the threshold must be appropriate. If it is too low, the ventilator will &quot;auto-cycle&quot; (ie, deliver a continual series of breaths), resulting in respiratory alkalosis; if too high, the patient will be &quot;locked out&quot; from ventilator-supported breaths, while expending considerable energy. In both conditions, the mechanically-vented patient will appear to be in respiratory distress, and the work of breathing will increase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory rate &ndash; The clinician determines the minimum number of breaths per minute (ie, respiratory rate) given to the patient by the ventilator. The rate can be adjusted according to the disease process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Respiratory rate'</a> and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Disease-specific ventilatory management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio &ndash; Inspiratory time is equal to tidal volume divided by flow rate (I time = <span class=\"nowrap\">TV/FR)</span>. Decreasing the tidal volume or increasing the flow rate decreases the inspiratory time, and decreases the inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio. The normal I:E ratio is 1:2 or 1:3. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinicians often reduce the I:E ratio to 1:4 or 1:5 in the presence of obstructive airway disease, which requires greater time for expiration. An inverse I:E ratio may be necessary in states of low lung compliance, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Inverse ratio ventilation may improve oxygenation in ARDS without elevating peak alveolar and inspiratory plateau pressures that can lead to further lung injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Inverse ratio ventilation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow &ndash; Flow rates and waves represent additional inspiration variables. Flow rates of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> are standard. Higher flow rates (up to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min)</span> may be required in certain conditions, such as obstructive airway disease (OAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In OAD, higher flow rates deliver the desired tidal volume more rapidly, allowing for increased expiratory time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Volume-limited ventilation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cycling &ndash; Ventilator &quot;cycling&quot; refers to the mechanism by which a breath changes from inspiration to expiration. Common methods for cycling a ventilator are volume, flow, and time. Volume-cycled breaths transition from inspiration to expiration after a preset volume of gas is delivered. This is the most common form. Flow-cycled inspiratory breaths transition after a preset airway pressure is reached, and flow decreases to a particular rate. Time-cycled inspiratory breaths transition after a predetermined inspiratory time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Inspiratory hold can also be included in the cycling mechanism. This function keeps air in the lungs at end-inspiration for longer intervals in order to maximize gas exchange.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive end-expiratory pressure &ndash; Applied or extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPe) can be provided by the ventilator to prevent premature airway closure and alveolar collapse at end expiration. PEEPe allows for improved oxygenation by increasing functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume at which pressure from elastic recoil equals PEEPe. By improving oxygenation, PEEPe can help clinicians reduce the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) being provided to the patient. PEEPe is often initially set with a minimum of 5 cmH2O, a level thought to be equivalent to physiologic PEEPe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &ndash; FiO2 is typically set at 1.0 (ie, 100 percent) when mechanical ventilation is initiated. As soon as possible, clinicians should reduce the FiO2 to nontoxic levels (generally 0.6 or less), provided that an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 90 percent or greater can be maintained (PaO2 above 60mmHg). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MODES OF VENTILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The emergency clinician should be familiar with the following modes of mechanical ventilation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assist-control ventilation (ACV)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure support ventilation (PSV)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV)</p><p/><p>ACV and SIMV are used most frequently in the emergency department. Either ACV or SIMV can be cycled based on the volume of gas delivered or the airway pressure reached. A brief description of the modes of ventilation of greatest relevance to emergency practice is provided here. There is no evidence that either mode of ventilation is superior to the other in terms of patient outcomes. More detailed discussions of the modes and advanced alternative modes of mechanical ventilation are found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-frequency ventilation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assist-control ventilation (ACV) &ndash; With ACV, every breath is fully supported by the ventilator, regardless of whether the breath is initiated by the patient or the machine. The clinician determines a base ventilatory rate, but the patient is able to breathe faster than this preset rate. ACV provides the patient with increased ventilatory support and reduces the work of breathing. Potential dangers include diminished cardiac output and inappropriate hyperventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pathophysiologic-consequences-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">ACV may be volume or pressure-cycled. In volume-cycled (ie, volume-targeted) ACV, the clinician determines the tidal volume, inspiratory flow rate, flow waveform, sensitivity to the patient's respiratory effort (ie, trigger), and basal ventilatory rate. When the patient breathes faster than the preset basal ventilatory rate, auto-PEEP causing excessive peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and subsequent lung injury may result, unless limited by a pressure alarm and &quot;pop-off&quot; valve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In pressure-cycled (ie, pressure-targeted) ACV, the clinician determines the ventilator's sensitivity to the patient's respiratory effort (ie, trigger), and the basal ventilatory rate. Unlike volume-controlled ACV, however, the clinician determines pressure levels and inspiratory time. Tidal volume is not set by the ventilator and is dependent upon airway pressures and the compliance of the lung and chest wall. While this mode allows the clinician to minimize PIP (and associated pressure-induced lung injury), specific tidal volume is not guaranteed, and will vary based upon the patient&rsquo;s airway resistance and lung compliance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) &ndash; In SIMV mode, the patient is allowed intermittent spontaneous breaths between the mandated, preset number of ventilator-supported breaths. Spontaneous breaths above the preset ventilatory rate are not supported by the ventilator. Either the patient or the ventilator can trigger the ventilator-supported breaths.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">SIMV creates less interference with normal cardiovascular function by decreasing auto-PEEP, lowering mean airway pressures, and preserving respiratory muscle function. However, it does increase the patient's work of breathing compared with ACV. SIMV also creates the risk of dyssynchrony between patient effort and ventilator-supported breaths. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pathophysiologic-consequences-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">With volume-cycled (ie, volume-targeted) SIMV, the tidal volume, inspiratory flow rate, flow waveform, sensitivity, and basal ventilatory rate are determined by the ventilator. With pressure-cycled (ie, pressure-targeted) SIMV, airway pressures, inspiratory time, sensitivity, and basal ventilatory rate are determined by the ventilator.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">SIMV is almost always combined with pressure support ventilation (PSV) in order to reduce the amount of work during intermittent spontaneous breaths. Generally, the set respiratory rate should allow 80 percent of breaths to be provided by the ventilator in order to minimize the work of breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure support ventilation (PSV) &ndash; With PSV, each breath must be patient-triggered, so the patient must possess intact respiratory drive. PSV is pressure-cycled and designed to reduce the patient's work of breathing by partially supporting spontaneous breaths. A minimal amount of pressure support is necessary to compensate for the inherent resistance of the endotracheal tube (ETT) and ventilator circuit; the smaller the ETT diameter, the higher the pressure support required. Most modern ventilators automatically compensate for this increased resistance, even when the PSV is set at zero. PSV is used primarily during stable ventilatory support periods and for weaning patients from ventilatory support. It is contraindicated in paralyzed and heavily sedated patients who cannot initiate a spontaneous breath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) &ndash; NPPV includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bi-level positive airway pressure (BLPAP), which is CPAP plus PSV. NPPV is delivered through a nasal or facial mask or a helmet, rather than an endotracheal or tracheotomy tube. CPAP is the noninvasive equivalent of continuous positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP); BLPAP is the noninvasive equivalent of ventilator-supported breathing. Contraindications to NPPV include the need for a definitive airway, high aspiration risk, and inability to tolerate mask ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60442\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60442 \">table 1</a>). In select patients with acute respiratory distress, NPPV has reduced the need for conventional mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical ventilation is associated with a number of pathophysiologic derangements which can lead to injury. Among these are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished cardiac output and hypotension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary barotrauma (eg, pneumothorax)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilator-associated lung injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Auto-PEEP (ie, intrinsic PEEP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated intracranial pressure</p><p/><p>These complications are discussed in detail elsewhere, but are briefly described below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pathophysiologic-consequences-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypotension and ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI), including barotrauma, are among the more important problems that occur after the institution of mechanical ventilation. Hypotension most often results from a combination of sedation, decreased venous return from elevated intrathoracic pressure, and diminished intravascular volume. These complications are often observed immediately after endotracheal intubation; hence, close monitoring during the post-intubation period is imperative. Barotrauma results from elevated pulmonary pressures. Clinicians can reduce the risk of barotrauma by minimizing plateau airway pressures. Reduced airway pressures, as well as reduced tidal volumes, also help minimize the risk of VALI. Clinicians need to be aware that some abnormalities, such as an elevated PaCO2, need not be corrected immediately to achieve physiologic norms or the patient&rsquo;s baseline, and that attempts to do so may increase the risk of VALI.</p><p>Pneumonia is a well-described complication of mechanical ventilation. ED clinicians can reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) simply by elevating the head of the patient's bed by at least 30 degrees, either by inclining the head of the bed upwards (ie, reverse Trendelenburg) or by placing the patient in a semirecumbent position (ie, not laying flat). Other strategies for reducing the risk of VAP are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-and-prevention-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO VENTILATORY MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no single optimal mode of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Diseases and patient condition vary over time, so clinicians should regularly reassess the settings and mode of ventilation. Nevertheless, certain guiding principles should be applied in most instances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize plateau pressures and tidal volumes, allowing hypercapnia if necessary (except in brain-injured patients), to reduce the risk of lung injury.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimize extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPe) to prevent alveolar collapse and improve oxygenation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce inspired oxygen to nontoxic levels (&le;60 percent) as quickly as possible.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) by maintaining the head in an elevated position whenever possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-and-prevention-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Selecting a ventilatory strategy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergency clinicians can select among three fundamental strategies for mechanical ventilation: noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), general invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), and lung-protective invasive positive pressure ventilation (L-IPPV). Below we describe the basic principles, indications, contraindications, and settings for each. Modifications to these basic approaches may be needed in specific disease states and these are described in the section on disease-specific management, as well as in separate UpToDate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Disease-specific ventilatory management'</a> below.)</p><p>Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) has proven most effective in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE). It may also be helpful in the management of immunocompromised patients and select patients with early ARDS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Contraindications to NPPV include the need for a definitive airway, high aspiration risk, and inability to tolerate mask ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60442\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60442 \">table 1</a>). Although NPPV supports the patient's ventilation, it does not secure the airway. The clinician using NPPV must be prepared to perform tracheal intubation if necessary, and acceptable to the patient or health care proxy. Patients should be monitored closely and formally reassessed within 30 minutes of application to ensure improvement or stabilization of respiratory compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>General invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) is the basic approach used in the majority of patients who require invasive ventilation. Such patients may include those with COPD, CPE, intoxication, trauma, and neuromuscular disease. </p><p>Lung-protective invasive positive pressure ventilation (L-IPPV) is the strategy used to prevent ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI), including barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. This is accomplished by using low-tidal volumes and by minimizing airway pressures, even if hypercapnia and mild acidosis result (so-called permissive hypercapnea). Oxygenation is maintained at low normal levels by using extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPe) and adjusting flow rates and the inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio to minimize injurious levels of FiO2. Patients who benefit from this approach include those with ARDS, pneumonia, thoracic trauma (eg, pulmonary contusion), and severe sepsis. Since hypercapnia and acidosis can compromise cerebral perfusion, L-IPPV should generally be avoided in patients with cerebral injury, stroke, or elevated intracranial pressure from other causes. If such patients are at high risk for ARDS, L-IPPV may be used <strong>IF</strong> hypercapnia and acidosis can be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permissive-hypercapnia-during-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permissive hypercapnia during mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Below we discuss some basic principles and the initial ventilator settings for each strategy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3571058\"><span class=\"h2\">Implementing the chosen ventilatory strategy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NPPV is defined and its mechanics described above. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Modes of ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p>The following settings are appropriate when initiating bi-level positive airway pressure (BLPAP), the preferred form of NPPV:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) 8 to 12 cm H2O</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) 0 to 5 cm H2O</p><p/><p>A gradient of at least 5 cm H20 between IPAP and EPAP should be maintained. NPPV is generally started at an <span class=\"nowrap\">IPAP/EPAP</span> of <span class=\"nowrap\">10/5</span> cm H2O. Both values can be increased gradually over approximately 10 minutes to provide greater ventilatory support. IPAP can be increased up to 20 cm H2O, and EPAP up to 10 to 12 cm H2O. Continuous pulse oximetry and end-tidal CO2 monitoring can help to determine NPPV's effectiveness in improving oxygenation and ventilation. Clinicians should reassess the patient within 30 minutes to determine if treatment is successful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">General invasive positive pressure ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients without parenchymal pulmonary disease or risk factors for respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who require intubation are managed using IPPV. Basic IPPV settings are used in patients without severe pulmonary disease or other complications (eg, stroke) obviating the use of lung-protective ventilatory strategies.

This maneuver removes a large number of potential problems and enables the clinician to concentrate on the patient, rather than the ventilator.</p><p>The emergency clinician can then approach the patient like any other intubated patient in respiratory distress, beginning with assessment of the airway, breathing, and circulation. Look for immediate threats to life, such as a dislodged or obstructed endotracheal tube, a tension pneumothorax, disruption of the oxygen supply, or dysrhythmia. Perform a focused history and physical examination including vital signs. The nurse and respiratory therapist may provide important history. Assess trends in ventilator parameters, such as a rising plateau pressure.

By measuring peak and plateau airway pressures, the clinician can localize problems to the airway or alveoli and determine a differential diagnosis, as shown in the following diagram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50510\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50510 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>The combination of elevated peak and plateau pressures reflects low compliance from underlying disease, such as pneumothorax, severe pulmonary edema, pulmonary effusion, hyperinflation, or elevated intraabdominal pressure from ascites or compartment syndrome. The combination of elevated peak pressures with normal plateau pressures suggests an obstruction to air flow within the ventilator circuit (eg, clogged endotracheal tube) or the proximal airways (eg, copious secretions, bronchospasm). Intrinsic peak end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi) should also be measured to determine if dynamic hyperinflation is present. Such patients are difficult to ventilate with a bag. Allowing a prolonged expiration and adjusting settings to prevent PEEPi should resolve this problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SEDATION AND ANALGESIA FOR THE VENTILATED PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once organic causes of distress are addressed, clinicians must ensure that the intubated patient receives adequate sedation and analgesia. A few important principles are mentioned below. The topic is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-control-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain control in the critically ill adult patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The Society of Critical Care Medicine's algorithm for sedation and analgesia of mechanically ventilated patients provides a reasonable approach. We have modified the original version for use in the emergency department (ED) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76559\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76559 \">algorithm 3</a>).</p><p>In the ED, it is often better to use short-acting medications when managing acutely unstable patients whose diagnoses may be unclear. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propofol</a> is an excellent short-acting sedative, and allows the clinician to perform frequent neurological examinations in patients with brain-injury. However, propofol can cause hypotension, and blood pressure support with a vasopressor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a>) may be needed. The use of propofol and other sedative (and analgesic) agents for longer term sedation of the critically ill is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-properties-dosage-regimens-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dosage regimens, and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The addition of analgesics is usually necessary for patient comfort, and reduces the amount of sedative required. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fentanyl</a>, a short-acting analgesic, is often used. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Morphine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> are also effective. Mechanically ventilated patients expected to have a prolonged ED stay are treated with infusions of sedatives and analgesics titrated to achieve targeted goals based upon pain and <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/agitation</span> scales.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">WEANING AND DISCONTINUATION OF MECHANICAL VENTILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the need for critical care services and emergency department lengths of stay increase, emergency clinicians will increasingly be called upon to provide long-term critical care management, including weaning and discontinuation of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Weaning is the process whereby mechanical ventilatory support is gradually withdrawn and the patient resumes spontaneous breathing. Weaning can be separated into two parts: weaning to partial ventilator support, and weaning to discontinuation of support and removal of the endotracheal tube. Aspects of weaning of particular import to the emergency clinician are described below. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult-to-wean adult patient in the intensive care unit&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Before beginning a weaning trial, clinicians should determine whether the patient is ready using the following criteria as a general guide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence for some reversal of the underlying cause of respiratory failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate oxygenation (PaO2 &gt;60 mmHg on FiO2 &lt;0.4; PEEPe &lt;10 cmH2O; <span class=\"nowrap\">PaO2/FiO2</span> &gt;150 to 300)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stable cardiovascular status (HR &lt;140; stable BP; no, or minimal, use of vasopressors)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No significant respiratory acidosis (pH &ge;7.25)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate hemoglobin (generally Hgb &gt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in patients without ischemic cardiac disease, or Hgb &gt;10 in patients with ischemic cardiac disease) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate mentation (arousable; can follow commands reliably; no continuous sedative infusions)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stable metabolic status (acceptable electrolyte levels)</p><p/><p>Clinicians should adapt these criteria to clinical circumstances; some patients will not satisfy all criteria yet be successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation. Over the years, a wide variety of physiologic indices have been proposed to assist in the discontinuation of ventilatory support. Such indices have varying strengths and weaknesses, and different applications. Variables such as respiratory rate, <span class=\"nowrap\">PaO2/FiO2</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(P/F)</span> ratio, and the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) are used.</p><p>RSBI is a commonly used assessment tool to determine readiness to wean and discontinue mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The RSBI measurement consists of a one-minute trial of unassisted breathing with an extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPe) of 0 cmH20 and pressure support of 0 cmH2O. At the end of one minute, the average respiratory rate is divided by the average tidal volume (VT) to obtain the RSBI (ie, RSBI = <span class=\"nowrap\">RR/VT)</span>. A number less than or equal to 105 has been found to be most predictive of successful extubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After an initial assessment of weaning, including calculation of a RSBI, we perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to determine if the patient is prepared for discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. There are three ways to perform an SBT: putting the patient on minimal pressure support and PEEPe, assessing respiratory parameters (so-called &quot;performing mechanics&quot;); using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) alone; or using a T-piece trial, which requires the patient to breathe through the endotracheal tube for a preset period of time with oxygen but without ventilatory support. Institutional approaches vary, but any of the methods described is acceptable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The criteria used to assess patient tolerance during an SBT are the respiratory pattern, adequacy of gas exchange, hemodynamic stability, and patient comfort. Generally, if the patient tolerates an SBT lasting 30 minutes, the mechanical ventilator should be discontinued and the endotracheal tube removed. A longer SBT (up to 120 minutes) may be necessary if the patient's condition is more uncertain.</p><p>Otherwise healthy patients intubated for a transient problem (eg, acute drug intoxication) can often be extubated rapidly following a brief period of observation. Once the problem has resolved and the patient is awake, breathing spontaneously, and manifesting no signs of respiratory or hemodynamic instability, the endotracheal tube can be removed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3570798\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation is performed in the emergency department (ED) to accomplish any of a number of goals, including the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To protect the airway</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To improve pulmonary gas exchange (ie, reverse hypoxemia or acute respiratory acidosis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To relieve respiratory distress (ie, decrease oxygen consumption or respiratory muscle fatigue)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To permit appropriate sedation and neuromuscular blockade</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To perform mechanical ventilation properly, emergency clinicians must be familiar with ventilator settings, modes of ventilation, and potential complications. Potential complications include diminished cardiac output, ventilator associated lung injury, and pneumonia. Ventilator management and additional complications are described in the text.

NPPV has proven most effective in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. L-IPPV is the strategy used to prevent ventilator-associated lung injury, including barotrauma. Each approach, including initial ventilator settings, is described in the text.
