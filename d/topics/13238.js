Violence in the media, intimate partner violence, and child abuse are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Violence is a major cause of death and disability for American children. Violence or witnessing violence has both physical and psychiatric sequelae, including posttraumatic stress disorder, adjustment reactions, severe grief reactions, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Pediatric care providers play an important role in prevention of violence. Universal (primary) prevention centers on screening and anticipatory guidance for the promotion of resilience and the avoidance of risk. Secondary prevention involves treatment, counseling, and referral for children and adolescents who have experienced violence-related injury. In addition, pediatric care providers can advocate for school policies and state and federal legislation to reduce the risk of violence for children. The newer view of violence prevention, discussed below, puts violence squarely in the context of improving individual and family resilience, and positively engaging adolescents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States has the highest youth homicide rate among the 23 wealthiest nations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Homicide is the third leading cause of death among 15- to 19-year-olds and the leading cause of death among black youth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Data describing nonfatal violence come from national surveillance systems and emergency departments. State and national data are available from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsbTa/EL1D6qMQOLvLCiPycazGeKc4VGJ2Bf6wTXf2NMbhYi/S01WWGw+G1gP9n2ZZQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=593\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System</a>. These statistics underestimate the prevalence of nonfatal violence because many victims do not seek medical treatment or because the cause of injury is not coded completely or correctly. Other government agencies track relevant data through surveys:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The United States Department of Education reported 188,000 fights or physical attacks not involving weapons, 11,000 fights involving weapons, and 4000 incidents of sexual assault in schools during the 1996-1997 school year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Nevertheless, schools remain the safest place for children. Vital statistics estimate that less than 1 percent of child and adolescent homicides occur in school (WISQARS), and the overwhelming proportion of assaults that do occur in school are of relatively minor severity (National Pediatric Trauma Registry, unpublished data courtesy of Director Carl DiScala, PhD).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 23 percent of high school students in the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey reported having been in a physical fight in the 12 months before the survey; fights were more common among boys than girls (28 versus 17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assaultive trauma recurs; hospital readmission rates for subsequent assaults and subsequent homicides are as high as 44 and 20 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most violence in the United States occurs between friends, acquaintances, or intimate partners, and the distinction between victim and perpetrator is not always clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. For this reason, violence prevention programs often emphasize conflict resolution skills. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Anticipatory guidance'</a> below and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Schools'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 16 percent of high school students in the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey reported carrying a weapon (gun, knife, or club) on at least one day in the month before the survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Weapon carrying was more commonly reported among boys than girls (24 versus 8 percent), and 4 percent of students reported carrying their weapons to school. The percentage of students carrying weapons decreased between 1991 and 1997 and stabilized between 1997 and 2015 (26 percent and 16 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RESILIENCE FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and from the Vermont Youth Risk Behavior Survey each demonstrate powerful protective effects of youth engagement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The NLSY analyses demonstrated that parental expectations and connectedness with parents and adults and with school protected against violence. The results showed the power of these protective factors, even in the presence of substantial risk factors. Social assets can be measured on a population level using proprietary surveys developed by the Search Institute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. They describe 40 positive attributes that protect young people and their communities. The Vermont Department of Public Health used similar constructs to add to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Their work showed there was an inverse correlation between measured assets and health risk behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>On a community level, the Chicago neighborhood study showed that among neighborhoods in Chicago with similar economic and demographic characteristics, improved neighborhood cohesion and self-efficacy were associated with large decreases in youth violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Programs directed at reducing youth violence are largely based on the positive youth development model, which has evidence of success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Programs for positive youth development are defined by the National Academy of Sciences as programs that seek to [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promote bonding and social, emotional, cognitive, behavioral, or moral competence</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foster resilience, self-determination, spirituality, self-efficacy, clear and positive identity, belief in the future, and prosocial norms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide recognition of positive behavior and opportunities for prosocial norms</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most serious violence-related injuries result when people who have learned to use violence to solve problems have access to weapons. Law enforcement agencies traditionally attempt to assign culpability in cases of violence, determining who was the victim and who was the perpetrator of a particular violent act. However, from a public health perspective, it most often emerges that both victims and perpetrators are caught in a culture of violence. Children and adolescents who fight regularly are at risk of severe injury.</p><p>Several key risk factors for violence and violence-related injury have been identified; they are complex, interdependent, and influenced by individual and societal variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/14,20-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20-29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous history of fighting or violence-related injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Violent discipline</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Access to firearms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol and other drug use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gang involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to intimate partner violence and child abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Media violence</p><p/><p>Children begin to develop aggressive behavior and violent habits of thought in the early years. In one prospective study, eight-year-old children in rural New York were followed for 22 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Television watching and peer-nominated aggression (being described as aggressive by peers) were independently associated with criminal conviction for violent crimes by the age of 30 years. Another study reported long-term follow-up of children observed beginning in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The investigators concluded that children begin to learn to control their innate aggression beginning at age 17 months, supporting the importance of influences in early childhood on subsequent violence and aggression.</p><p>Later in life, experiencing violence (being shot, stabbed, or beaten) among men aged 17 to 29 years was identified as a risk for violent behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Those who reported more serious traumatic experiences, such as incarceration, witnessing violence, or carrying a weapon, had the highest risk of violent assault (odds ratio 10, 95% CI 4-25). Girls, too, are more likely to behave violently if they have been victims of violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Violent discipline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of violent discipline methods teaches children that violence is an appropriate means of shaping behavior. In addition, children whose parents are unable to set effective limits may develop dysfunctional behavior patterns of interaction, particularly if corporal punishment is used extensively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Dysfunctional interaction may lead to poor performance and social isolation in the early school years and, later, association with peer groups that reward violence and antisocial behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Access to firearms and weapon carrying</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is estimated that 2 to 13 percent of children younger than 18 years of age live in households that contain loaded firearms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>], and only 6 percent of families with children surveyed kept their guns unloaded, locked, locked up, or separate from ammunition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Handgun owners typically keep the guns for self-defense. However, deaths caused by suicide, homicide, or unintentional injury outnumber deaths associated with self-defense by 40 to 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Teenagers are five times more likely to die from suicide if there is a gun in the home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Each year, more than 100 American children younger than four years of age die from firearm injuries. The prevention of firearm injuries is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=firearm-injuries-in-children-prevention#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Firearm injuries in children: Prevention&quot;, section on 'Framework for prevention'</a>.)</p><p>The carrying of weapons also increases the risk of violent behavior and violence-related injury by providing a false sense of security that contributes to impulsive behavior. In a 1993 probability survey of more than 3000 high school students in Massachusetts, weapon carrying on school property was associated with increased frequency of physical fights on school property [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. More recent data suggest that youth treated in the emergency department for assault related injuries have high rates of firearm possession [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Overall, firearms-related injuries account for thousands of hospitalizations in children younger than 14 and an estimated 3200 cases of long-term disability in children younger than 18 each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. In 2009, over 7000 American children were hospitalized for nonfatal firearms injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. It is estimated that approximately one-half of these nonfatal injuries are the result of assaults.</p><p>Preventing access to firearms is clearly an adult responsibility, as child-centered programs designed to teach firearms safety to grade-school children do not prevent children from handling real weapons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=firearm-injuries-in-children-prevention#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Firearm injuries in children: Prevention&quot;, section on 'Framework for prevention'</a>). Clinicians may be more successful in preventing firearm injuries when counseling focuses on characteristics of the child, rather than on firearms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol/drug use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Substance abuse, which alters the dynamics and decisions in violent or near-violent episodes, is associated with an increased risk of exposure to violence, carrying weapons, and homicide among adolescents and street gangs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/29,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,52-54</a>]. Early onset of alcohol or drug use increases the risk of abuse-related violence that continues into adulthood. In one survey of more than 40,000 adults between 18 and 44 years of age, those who began drinking alcohol before age 14 years were 14 times more likely to report having been in an alcohol-related fight within the past year than those who began drinking after age 21 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Gang participation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The National Youth Gang Survey (1996-2009) estimates that there are approximately 26,000 gangs and 775,000 gang members in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Children and adolescents who participate in gangs are more likely to promote aggressive attitudes, report victimization experiences, be involved in fights, carry weapons to school, and use drugs or alcohol at school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Witnessing violence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The witnessing of violence by children increases the risk that they will react violently later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. More than one-half of the six-year-old inner-city children in a cross-sectional study of exposure to violence had witnessed some form of violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Violence on <span class=\"nowrap\">television/media</span> typically is socially acceptable, being used by heroes and villains alike. Young children, unable to separate fact from fantasy, are more affected by <span class=\"nowrap\">television/media</span> violence than are adults. Viewing violence can lead to increased aggressive attitudes, values, and behavior, particularly in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Children who view violence on <span class=\"nowrap\">television/media</span> are more likely to experience violence and less likely to intervene in tense situations when they are bystanders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Exposure to <span class=\"nowrap\">television/media</span> violence also may be associated with increased aggressive behavior. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=television-and-media-violence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Television and media violence&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Bullying</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bullying is the repeated infliction of harm on younger, smaller, or less powerful peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Almost 10 percent of students in grades 6 through 12 report having been bullied at school, school activities, or on the way to or from school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. Both the bully and the victim are affected by bullying. Effects on victims include physical injury, difficulty concentrating, physical symptoms (eg, nausea, anorexia), symptoms of anxiety or depression, poor self-esteem, and high rates of school absence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. Bullies, however, often feel powerful and effective. In contrast to the situation in childhood, the long-term outcome (at age 30 years) for bullies themselves is especially poor. They are more likely to be incarcerated and are less likely to be employed, married, or in other stable adult relationships than are their peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Community violence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies conducted in poor urban neighborhoods identified a pattern of violence in which fighting and the willingness to fight are key components of a protective strategy for coping with dangerous environments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Young people who are unwilling or unable to defend themselves are prey to multiple and repeated attacks in the &quot;code of the streets.&quot; Some parents understand this culture and may actually encourage their children to become able fighters to defend themselves. However, parents can play a crucial role in encouraging safe behavior. They can teach their children how to defuse tense situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/51,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,77</a>]. Resources to help parents encourage safe behaviors are available through the American Academy of Pediatrics (eg, the &quot;Talking with your teen: Tips for parents&quot; and &quot;Staying cool when things heat up&quot; brochures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Resources'</a> below.)</p><p>Certain neighborhood factors can mitigate community violence.

The screening questions depend upon the child's age and developmental stage and the cultural background of the family. In most cases, children may be asked directly whether they have been involved in or witness to any violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The assessment of family functioning, family stress, coping mechanisms, and support systems, always a key component of routine health care maintenance, is also an important dimension of preventing violence. Environmental factors, chiefly access to guns, should be assessed periodically. Finally, abrupt deterioration in school performance may indicate violence or a related health risk factor including bullying, depression, substance abuse, intimate partner abuse, or family illness. Emotional and behavioral problems can be assessed using the <a href=\"http://www.massgeneral.org/psychiatry/services/psc_forms.aspx&amp;token=UTg+fSCDj5CTtR8IfrfJSX53zuYrY7E7h9bVn03sTtw6XhqeQzg4NvUPIo6Y+o180P36wt/VuT55m3fYeHziUQp8ZtbepaPb8EomGS6n8sY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=593\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Pediatric Symptom Checklist</a> or the Child Behavior Checklist.

Children visit their health care provider frequently during infancy and early childhood. These visits furnish multiple opportunities for the provider to provide focused interventions toward prevention of violence. The provider can identify and attempt to modulate risk factors for violence. In addition, he or she can attempt to enhance the protective factors (eg, intact family structure, positive peer groups, self-esteem, and confidence). Pediatric health care providers can encourage parents to model nonviolent behavior, anger management, and conflict resolution for their children. In addition, children should be encouraged to participate in activities that are socially acceptable and build useful life skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>Some aspects of violence prevention counseling, such as the presence of guns in the home, media violence, or the need to maintain family relationships, apply to all age groups.

Pediatric care providers play an important role in prevention of violence through screening and providing anticipatory guidance for promotion of resilience and avoidance of risk. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that protect against youth violence include youth engagement (eg, parental expectations, connectedness with parents, adults, and school), neighborhood cohesion and self-efficacy, and programs that promote positive youth development (eg, bonding, social, emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and moral competence, self-determination, spirituality, self-efficacy, belief in the future). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Resilience factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for violence include a history of fighting or violence-related injury, violent discipline, access to firearms, alcohol and other drug use, gang involvement, and exposure to violence in the home, media, school, or community. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric care providers should screen for violence and violence risk factors at routine health care visits. The screening questions depend upon the child's age and developmental stage and the cultural background of the family. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teenagers should be asked directly about violence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57574 \">table 1</a>). Their risk for violence-related injury is stratified according to other factors, including school attendance, performance, violence history, and drug use. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Adolescent screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association recommend violence prevention counseling. Health care visits during infancy, childhood, and adolescence provide opportunities to identify and attempt to modulate violence risk and resilience factors. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Anticipatory guidance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Resources'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary prevention involves treatment, counseling, and referral for children and adolescents who have experienced violence-related injury. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prevention'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wu L, Zhang D, Su Z, Hu T.
