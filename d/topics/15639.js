Congenital sex chromosome abnormalities occur in at least 1 in 448 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Sex chromosome mosaicism involving a normal cell line is not unusual. The two most common forms of sex chromosome mosaicism are <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XX</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XY</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The severity of the phenotype in patients with mosaicism is related to the percentage of abnormal cells among critical tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11420526\"><span class=\"h2\">Monosomy X (45,X or Turner syndrome)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with Turner syndrome have monosomy for the X chromosome with a 45,X karyotype. Other forms of Turner include mosaicism for X chromosome monosomy (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XX)</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XY</span> mosaic with or without a partial deletion of the Y chromosome. The remaining patients have a structural abnormality of the second X chromosome (eg, an isochromosome of the long arm of X or a deletion involving the short arm of one X). Deletions involving the distal portion of the short arm of the Y chromosome are associated with the Turner phenotype because these individuals are missing the so-called &quot;anti-Turner&quot; genes (<em>SHOX</em>, <em>RPSY4</em>, and <em>ZFY</em>). Deletions of the short arm of the X chromosome are also associated with a Turner phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most cases represent sporadic events. (See <a href=\"#H3195118\" class=\"local\">'45,X/46,XX mosaicism'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3195154\" class=\"local\">'45,X/46,XY mosaicism'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3287567\" class=\"local\">'Isochromosome Xq'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3287938\" class=\"local\">'Xp22 SHOX deletions'</a> below.)</p><p>Turner syndrome is characterized by short stature. Dysmorphic features are common and include low and posteriorly rotated ears, webbing of the neck, shield-like chest (broad chest with wide-spaced nipples), cubitus valgus, short fourth metacarpals, and hypoplastic nails. Other frequent findings include lymphedema, pigmented nevi, and congenital heart defects. Lymphedema in the dorsum of hands and feet may be the only clinical feature seen in newborns. The heart defects typically involve the left outflow tract, and coarctation of the aorta is a common finding. In addition, Turner patients develop streak gonads with ovarian failure and pubertal delay. Renal anomalies can also occur (horseshoe kidneys). Individuals with Turner syndrome that carry Y chromosome material (as is seen in some patients with mosaicism) are at increased risk of developing gonadoblastoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-turner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Turner syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients diagnosed with Turner syndrome should have an echocardiogram including views of the aortic arch, cytogenetic studies to determine the presence of Y chromosome material that may increase risk for gonadoblastoma development, renal ultrasound, and referral to an endocrine specialist for later sex hormone replacement and growth hormone treatment. Turner syndrome is discussed in detail separately.

The 47,XXY karyotype results from nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes and can be maternal or paternal in origin. Most cases are detected postnatally and are diagnosed during evaluation for infertility or gynecomastia.</p><p>Male newborns with the 47,XXY karyotype are phenotypically normal, with normal male external genitalia and no dysmorphic features. The major clinical manifestations of Klinefelter syndrome include tall stature, small testes, and infertility (azoospermia) that become noticeable after puberty. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome are at increased risk for psychiatric disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and social problems. Patients diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome should have a neurodevelopmental evaluation and should be referred to an endocrinologist. Klinefelter syndrome is discussed in greater detail separately.

A significant proportion of XYY males require special educational intervention but are generally educated in mainstream school settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. They have normal pubertal development, and most are fertile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The child with tall stature and/or abnormally rapid growth&quot;</a>). Due to the subtlety of the phenotype and lack of associated health problems, many individuals with 47,XYY remain undiagnosed throughout their lifespan.</p><p>In an early report, 47,XYY males were thought to have increased aggressive behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, a subsequent large collaborative study by European and United States geneticists concluded that the increased rate of antisocial behavior in XYY males was related to a lack of judgment and lower socioeconomic status due to a lower mean intelligence quotient (IQ) score (by 10 points), which led them into difficulties with the law and involvement in minor crimes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Higher rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorders are reported in 47,XYY [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A neurodevelopmental evaluation is recommended in patients diagnosed with 47,XYY, given the high prevalence of learning disabilities and behavioral problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11420547\"><span class=\"h2\">47,XXX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>47,XXX (also called triple X) is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most individuals with 47,XXX are diagnosed incidentally on prenatal genetic screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These women do not appear to be at increased risk of having chromosomally abnormal offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A review of 155 females with 47,XXX karyotype found that 62 percent of these individuals were physically normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, it is estimated that most individuals with 47,XXX are never diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. 47,XXX females have a tendency to be tall, with many reaching the 80<sup>th</sup> percentile in height by adolescence, but with an average head circumference between the 25<sup>th</sup> to 35<sup>th</sup> percentile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Puberty and fertility are generally the normal range, but premature ovarian failure can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>]. Another prospective study of 11 47,XXX females identified in a newborn survey at birth reported that their verbal and performance IQ scores were 15 to 20 points lower than those of their siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

There appears to be a direct relationship between the number of additional sex chromosomes and the severity of the phenotype. In addition, a review of tetrasomy and pentasomy of sex chromosomes concluded that polysomy of the X chromosome results in a more deleterious effect than polysomy of the Y chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Studies have shown that the IQ is reduced by 10 points for every extra X chromosome beyond the normal XX or XY complements in females and males, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3287436\"><span class=\"h3\">49,XXXXY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic clinical features of the XXXXY karyotype are low nasal bridge with a wide or upturned tip, wide-set eyes, epicanthal folds, skeletal anomalies (especially radioulnar synostosis), congenital heart disease, endocrine disorders, and severe hypogonadism and hypogenitalism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/24,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28,29</a>]. Severe intellectual disability and moderately short stature are common. Although individuals with this karyotype are often labeled as Klinefelter variant, the characteristic features of XXXXY all point to a distinct phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/24,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3287443\"><span class=\"h3\">49,XXXXX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intellectual disability is always present in females with 49,XXXXX (also called pentasomy X) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

There were two stillbirths and 20 cases with an abnormal phenotype (12 had some features of Turner syndrome, and 8 showed anomalies possibly not related to Turner syndrome). Over 85 percent of cases appeared to result in phenotypically normal females either at birth or at termination. However, the major features of Turner syndrome (eg, short stature and lack of secondary sex characteristics) are only manifested later in childhood or adolescence and would not be detected among infants. <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XX</span> mosaicism is reported in some women with premature ovarian failure who are otherwise phenotypically normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3195154\"><span class=\"h2\">45,X/46,XY mosaicism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mosaicism involving <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XY</span> has a wide phenotypic spectrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In a retrospective series of 151 postnatally diagnosed cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XY</span> mosaicism, for example, 42 percent of patients were phenotypic females with typical or atypical Turner syndrome, 42 percent had ambiguous external genitalia and asymmetrical gonads (ie, mixed gonadal dysgenesis), and 15 percent had a male phenotype with incomplete masculinization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thus, all postnatally diagnosed cases were phenotypically abnormal. However, this can be explained by the fact that children or adults with mosaicism and a normal phenotype are not likely to seek medical attention (ascertainment bias). In contrast, among 80 prenatally diagnosed cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XY</span> mosaicism, 74 (92.5 percent) were grossly normal males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

The <em>SHOX</em> gene is found in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) of the X and Y chromosomes.

LWD is characterized by short stature, more severe in females, and Madelung deformities (focal dysplasia of the distal radial physis). Homozygous deletions of <em>SHOX</em> cause Langer dysplasia, a more severe form of metaphyseal dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. <em>SHOX</em> deletions can also be seen in patients with short stature and no other specific skeletal signs. More than 60 percent of the <em>SHOX</em> rearrangements are gene deletions; therefore, array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) should be considered in the work-up of idiopathic short stature, followed by sequencing to ascertain point mutations if no deletions are found.

There has been much debate about whether this duplication is pathogenic or a benign finding, underscoring the difficulties in determining the consequences of copy number variations (CNVs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. This duplication involves the <em>STS</em> (steroid sulfatase) gene. Deletions of this gene are associated with X-linked ichthyosis in males. This duplication has been reported in patients with intellectual disabilities. However, it has also been seen in the patients' normal relatives as well as in the general population. While duplications of this gene may have no phenotypic consequences, triplications are consistently associated with intellectual disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies can ultimately aid in distinguishing duplications from triplications or multiple copy number gains.

All patients identified with this microduplication had disease onset before five years of age. The G protein-coupled receptor was overexpressed in the patients' pituitary lesions.

Males with this duplication are severely impaired (MIM #300260). The clinical presentation includes early hypotonia, severe-to-profound intellectual disability, speech delay, feeding difficulties, frequent respiratory infections, and seizures (ranging from tonic-clonic type to absence seizures) that are sometimes refractory to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>]. Many patients with this duplication have been diagnosed with autism or autism spectrum disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Similarly to what is seen in Rett syndrome, patients with <em>MECP2</em> duplication experience developmental regression. In addition, they develop ataxia, progressive lower limbs spasticity, and often lose their ability to ambulate. Gastrointestinal problems and severe constipation have been reported. The prognosis is guarded, and most males with this duplication die in their mid-20s secondary to respiratory infections. The gene for interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (<em>IRAK1</em>) is often involved in the duplication and may play a role in the immune abnormalities seen in this group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-chromosome-abnormalities/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Triplication of this region produces an even more severe phenotype in males.</p><p>Screening studies for these patients include an EEG, swallowing studies, and assessment of humoral and cellular immunity. Treatment may include management of hypotonia (PT and OT) and spasticity, ST, gastrostomy tube (g-tube or g-button) for feeding difficulties, and management of respiratory infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8049117\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex chromosome abnormalities can be due to numeric abnormalities (aneuploidies) or structural defects.
