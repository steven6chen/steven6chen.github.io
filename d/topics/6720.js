Although some propose relatively rapid initiation of antihypertensive therapy in this setting, there may be more risk than benefit from such an aggressive regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of severe asymptomatic hypertension (hypertensive urgencies) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, some patients with significantly elevated blood pressure have signs or symptoms of acute, ongoing target-organ damage. Such patients have a hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergencies can develop in patients with or without known preexisting hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In younger (&lt; 60 years of age) people, the diastolic pressure is typically &ge;120 mmHg, but there is no specific threshold since individuals who develop an acute rise in blood pressure can develop symptoms if the previous pressure was normal (such as in a pregnant woman who develops eclampsia or a young adult who develops acute glomerulonephritis).</p><p>The term &quot;malignant hypertension&quot; entered the medical lexicon in 1928 because, at that time, patients with this condition had a prognosis that was similar to patients with many cancers.

In fact, hypertensive encephalopathy is most often a diagnosis of exclusion, confirmed retrospectively when the mental status improves after the blood pressure is lowered into the autoregulatory range. Thus, patients with suspected hypertensive encephalopathy should have their blood pressure lowered by approximately 10 to 20 percent during the first hour of treatment. However, additional lowering should be gradual such that, compared with the initial blood pressure upon presentation, the pressure is reduced by no more than 25 percent at the end of the first day of treatment.

However, some patients with significantly elevated blood pressure have signs or symptoms of acute, ongoing target-organ damage. Such patients have a hypertensive emergency. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history and physical examination in patients presenting with a severely elevated blood pressure (or an acute rise in blood pressure over a previously normal baseline, even if the presenting pressure is <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;180/120</span> mmHg) should seek to identify signs and symptoms of acute target-organ damage; in addition, certain laboratory and, in some settings, imaging studies may be needed. (See <a href=\"#H70455669\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal therapy, including the choice of agent and the blood pressure goal, varies according to the specific hypertensive emergency. It is generally unwise to lower the blood pressure too quickly or too much, as ischemic damage can occur in vascular beds that have reset their autoregulatory threshold to the higher level of blood pressure. For most hypertensive emergencies, mean arterial pressure should be reduced by approximately 10 to 20 percent in the first hour and then gradually during the next 23 hours so that the final pressure is reduced by approximately 25 percent compared with baseline. (See <a href=\"#H70455682\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major exceptions to modest and gradual blood pressure lowering over the first 24 hours are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The acute phase of an ischemic stroke &ndash; The blood pressure is usually <strong>not</strong> lowered unless it is <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;185/110</span> mmHg in patients who are candidates for reperfusion therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50725\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50725 \">table 1</a>) or <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;220/120</span> mmHg in patients who are not candidates for reperfusion therapy.
