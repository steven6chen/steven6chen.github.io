The hallmark of the disorder is a fluctuating degree and variable combination of weakness in ocular, bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles. Weakness is the result of an antibody-mediated, T-cell dependent immunological attack directed at proteins in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction (acetylcholine receptors or receptor-associated proteins). The diagnosis of MG can be established by clinical and serologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the differential diagnosis of MG, including conditions that mimic ocular myasthenia and conditions that mimic generalized myasthenia. The diagnosis of MG is discussed separately, as are other aspects of this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33578208\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF MYASTHENIA GRAVIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of MG is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimal approach to the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis varies with the clinical setting. The first step is to establish that the symptoms and signs are consistent with myasthenia gravis and not another disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The bedside ice pack test can be used to support the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis in patients with ptosis, but it is <strong>not</strong> helpful for those with extraocular muscle weakness. The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a> (Tensilon) test should be used only in those patients with obvious ptosis or ophthalmoparesis, in whom improvement after infusion of the drug can easily be observed. The sensitivity of the Tensilon test for the diagnosis of MG is in the range of 80 to 90 percent, but it is associated with many false-negative and false-positive results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Bedside tests'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of MG should be confirmed, if possible, by immunologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrophysiologic testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77349 \">table 1</a>). Because of its specificity, testing for autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR-Ab) should be performed on all patients. Demonstration of binding antibodies, possible in 80 to 90 percent of patients with generalized disease, provides the laboratory confirmation of myasthenia gravis. If the AChR-Abs are negative, an assay for antibodies to muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) should be performed. Antibodies to MuSK are present in 38 to 50 percent of those with AChR-Ab negative, generalized myasthenia. Seronegative myasthenia gravis, also called antibody-negative myasthenia gravis, refers to the 6 to 12 percent of patients with generalized myasthenia who have a negative standard assay for AChR-Ab and MuSK-Ab. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Serologic testing'</a>.)</p><p>Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) studies and single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) have a diagnostic sensitivity in generalized myasthenia of about 75 percent and 95 percent, respectively. RNS studies should be performed first, followed by SFEMG, if the diagnosis is still uncertain. Electrophysiologic tests usually allow confirmation of the diagnosis in patients who have seronegative myasthenia gravis. They may be helpful in those with positive antibody studies as well, particularly if there are any unusual clinical features or a lack of response to immunotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Electrophysiologic confirmation'</a>.)</p><p>Studies to exclude other diseases in the differential diagnosis of myasthenia gravis are also indicated in selected patients. For those with ocular or bulbar symptoms, an MRI of the brain is appropriate. CT scanning or ultrasound of the orbits is helpful in the differential diagnosis of ocular myasthenia and thyroid ophthalmopathy. Lumbar puncture may be necessary to exclude lymphomatous or carcinomatous meningitis with certain clinical presentations. Blood tests should include thyroid function tests. If there is clinical suspicion of an associated rheumatologic disorder, assays for antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor should also be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Associated conditions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL BY PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differential diagnostic considerations early in the presentation of possible MG depend largely on the initial signs and symptoms. The correct diagnosis can usually be established by other clinical features on examination and the appropriate serologic and electrophysiologic studies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular weakness, manifested by diplopia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ptosis, is the initial feature in about 50 percent of patients with MG. Other disorders to consider include those that mimic ocular MG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bulbar symptoms, such as dysarthria or dysphagia, are the first abnormalities in about 15 percent of patients with MG. Motor neuron disease, obstructive lesions of the oropharynx, brainstem disorders, or multiple cranial nerve palsies may produce similar symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limb weakness as the sole early manifestation occurs in &lt;5 percent of patients with MG. Diagnostic considerations include motor neuron disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and other motor neuropathies, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, and myopathies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated respiratory involvement is rare in MG, but may also occur in motor neuron disease and acid maltase deficiency myopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDITIONS THAT MIMIC OCULAR MYASTHENIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disorders that are likely to be confused with ocular MG involve weakness of both eyelid and oculomotor function, producing diplopia and ptosis. They include the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid ophthalmopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myotonic dystrophy and oculopharyngeal dystrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brainstem and motor cranial nerve pathology</p><p/><p>These conditions are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-myasthenia-gravis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ocular myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDITIONS THAT MIMIC GENERALIZED MYASTHENIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of neuromuscular disorders that can be confused with myasthenia clinically. This should always be kept in mind so that a careful history, physical examination, and laboratory testing can allow the correct diagnosis to be established. Electrodiagnostic studies are particularly crucial in the differential diagnosis of these other neuromuscular disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although fatigable weakness may be a major aspect of MG, it is important to differentiate this from complaints of generalized fatigue or tiredness. This lack of energy, often described as overwhelming fatigue, is not part of MG and is never the sole manifestation. This symptom is generally due to an underlying medical disorder (eg, anemia), progressive deconditioning, or psychological etiology. In myasthenia, the symptoms usually include specific complaints of fatigable weakness. Examples include diplopia or ptosis that develop late in the day, difficulty with prolonged chewing, development of dysarthria or hypophonia with prolonged speech, or neck extensor weakness late in the day, with the inability to keep the head upright.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor neuron disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive disease that, like myasthenia, can involve the bulbar muscles, leading to facial weakness, dysarthria, or dysphagia. However, ptosis or ocular dysmotility producing diplopia as typically seen with MG are NOT features of ALS. Other manifestations that distinguish ALS from MG on clinical grounds are the presence of both upper motor neuron signs (hyperreflexia and Babinski signs) and lower motor neuron signs (atrophy and fasciculations) in ALS, together with its progressive nature. In addition, electrophysiologic studies are useful in differentiating these disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of note, a false-positive Tensilon test can occur in ALS. In addition, a false-positive test for AChR-Ab is seen in approximately 3 to 5 percent of ALS patients, although usually in low titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) shares with MG the involvement of the neuromuscular junction, and it has a similar pathophysiology (an autoimmune disease often associated with malignancy). However, the clinical presentation is different in LEMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is more often confused with myopathies. Proximal leg weakness, making it difficult for the patient to rise from a chair or to climb stairs, is typically the earliest and most prominent symptom. Less dramatic shoulder girdle weakness eventually occurs. Involvement of the bulbar muscles or diplopia is less common in LEMS than in MG, but ptosis is frequently seen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the differences in muscle distribution, there are several other important differences between LEMS and MG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms in LEMS are more likely to be present in the morning and to improve with exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic dysfunction, such as erectile dysfunction in men or dry mouth, is a frequent symptom in LEMS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) at high rates (20 to 50 cycles per second) produces a marked increase in the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude (an incremental response) in patients with LEMS, as does brief exercise. In contrast, there is a lack of an incremental response in MG with high rate RNS or exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately half of patients have cancer, usually small cell lung cancer.</p><p/><p>The typical electrodiagnostic findings of LEMS and detection of serum antibodies to the presynaptic voltage-dependent calcium channels establishes the diagnosis of LEMS. LEMS is associated with specific autoantibodies. Over 95 percent of patients have antibodies against <span class=\"nowrap\">P/Q-type</span> calcium channels; in comparison, less than 5 percent of patients with myasthenia have such antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic syndromes affecting peripheral nerve and muscle&quot;, section on 'Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Occasional patients with LEMS have AChR-Ab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Distinction from MG in this setting is made by the presence of small cell lung cancer (in half), antibodies directed against the <span class=\"nowrap\">P/Q</span> type calcium channels, and the electrophysiological features of a presynaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rarely, a patient will have the clinical, immunological, and electrophysiological features of both disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Botulism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Botulism can be confused with myasthenia because it also prominently affects the bulbar and eye muscles. However, the botulinum toxin produces pupillary paralysis in approximately one-half of affected patients, whereas pupillary function is spared in MG. Botulism is further distinguished from MG by its rapid progression and its usual association with ingestion of food contaminated by Clostridium botulinum. The presynaptic localization of the abnormality in botulism can be confirmed by an incremental response during high-frequency RNS or after brief exercise, similar to that seen in LEMS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neuromuscular-junction-toxins#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neuromuscular junction toxins&quot;, section on 'Botulism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Penicillamine-induced myasthenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 1 percent of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>, usually for rheumatoid arthritis or Wilson's disease, develop an autoimmune myasthenia gravis that shares many of the characteristics of primary MG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This occurs because penicillamine induces the production of AChR antibodies. This effect should not be confused with the exacerbation of MG that may occur due to drugs that pharmacologically interfere with neuromuscular transmission. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Myasthenia induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> usually resolves within 3 to 12 months once the drug is withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, resolution of myasthenia may be quite slow, and treatment for myasthenia may be required if symptoms are severe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Statins and myasthenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Statin treatment may be associated with a myasthenic syndrome or exacerbation of myasthenia symptoms.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular junction disorders in newborns and infants&quot;, section on 'Congenital myasthenic syndromes'</a>.)</p><p>These genetic disorders should be considered when any of the following conditions are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive family history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lack of response to anticholinesterase drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absence of AChR or MuSK antibodies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history dating back to childhood.</p><p/><p>Patients with congenital myasthenic syndromes usually have a long history of illness, often beginning in childhood, followed by slow, steady progression &ndash; a pattern that would be most unusual for autoimmune MG. Certain electrodiagnostic findings (eg, multiple CMAP responses to a single nerve stimulation) are a clue to a few of these disorders. The lack of a family history does not exclude these as a possibility, since there are recessive and sporadic forms.</p><p>Although these conditions are not immune-mediated, they are confused with MG because they also involve dysfunction of the acetylcholine-mediated neuromuscular synaptic transmission. Presynaptic and postsynaptic dysfunction can all lead to varying patterns of weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Some presynaptic forms, usually with infantile onset, have abnormalities in acetylcholine packaging, resynthesis, or mobilization. In other forms of these disorders, the abnormalities are postsynaptic and are due to mutations in the acetylcholine receptor subunits. This results in gated channels that show either increased or reduced sensitivity to acetylcholine stimulation. Congenital end-plate acetylcholinesterase deficiency produces weakness due to depolarizing block from excessive ACh action postsynaptically.</p><p>All of these disorders have electrophysiologic features of a disorder of neuromuscular transmission, similar to MG. This includes decremental responses on repetitive nerve stimulation at 2 to 3 Hertz, as well as increased jitter values on single-fiber electromyography. Some forms (eg, slow channel syndrome and end-plate acetylcholinesterase deficiency) have a characteristic electrophysiologic finding of multiple motor (CMAP) responses after a single nerve stimulation.</p><p>In suspected cases, molecular genetic testing may sometimes confirm the diagnosis. In many, physiologic analysis of an intercostal muscle biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. These studies are not widely available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the disorders that are likely to be confused with myasthenia gravis (MG) involve weakness of the extraocular muscles.
