Hemoptysis has a broad differential, but the cause can be determined in the majority of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96527 \">table 1</a>). It is important to identify the cause and location of bleeding in order to guide treatment. </p><p>The evaluation of nonmassive hemoptysis that is not immediately life-threatening will be reviewed here. The acute evaluation and management of massive (life-threatening) hemoptysis are discussed separately.

In our clinical practice, we define massive hemoptysis as either &ge;500 mL of expectorated blood over a 24 hour period or bleeding at a rate &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. </p><p>Patients with mild-to-moderate hemoptysis and adequate gas exchange generally do not require hospitalization and the evaluation can proceed in a stepwise fashion as described below. Massive hemoptysis requires a prompt response to ensure adequate ventilation, protect the airway, and control the hemoptysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-massive-hemoptysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of massive hemoptysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BRONCHIAL VERSUS PULMONARY VASCULAR ORIGINS OF HEMOPTYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood traversing the lungs can arrive from one of two sources: pulmonary arteries or bronchial arteries. Virtually the entire cardiac output courses through the low-pressure pulmonary arteries and arterioles en route to being oxygenated in the pulmonary capillary bed. In contrast, the bronchial arteries are under much higher systemic pressure, but carry only a small portion of the cardiac output. Bleeding from a bronchial artery is the cause of massive hemoptysis in 90 percent of cases.</p><p>Generally, one or two bronchial arteries supply each lung, typically arising from the aorta and less commonly from the intercostal or vertebral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hemoptysis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These vessels provide the nutritive blood supply to the airways, hilar lymph nodes, visceral pleura, and some portions of the mediastinum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hemoptysis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Despite the quantitatively smaller contribution of the bronchial circulation to pulmonary blood flow, the bronchial arteries are generally a more important source of hemoptysis than the pulmonary circulation. In addition to being perfused at a higher pressure, the bronchial arteries also supply blood to the airways and to lesions within the airways. In some circumstances, such as bronchiectasis, the bronchial circulation becomes hyperplastic and tortuous, and can be a source of massive hemoptysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF HEMOPTYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term hemoptysis typically refers to expectoration of blood originating from the lower respiratory tract. Blood originating from below the vocal cords can best be categorized according to the site of bleeding (ie, airways, lung parenchymal, pulmonary vascular, cryptogenic) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96527 \">table 1</a>). Bronchitis, bronchogenic carcinoma, and bronchiectasis are the most common causes of hemoptysis in developed countries, while infections due to <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and <em>Paragonimus westermani</em> are more common causes in endemic countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hemoptysis-in-adults/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p>Blood from the upper respiratory tract and the upper gastrointestinal tract can also be expectorated and, thus, mimic blood coming from the lower respiratory tract, a situation called pseudohemoptysis.</p><p>In a case series of patients undergoing arterial embolization for hemoptysis, the most common causes of hemoptysis were <span class=\"nowrap\">bronchiectasis/cystic</span> fibrosis (40 percent), lung metastasis (14 percent), lung cancer (12 percent), and fungal infection (7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hemoptysis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Bronchiectasis has a long list of causes, including cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and prior pneumonia. Even though bronchiectasis is typically associated with frequent cough and copious sputum production, the clinical manifestations may be more subtle, particularly in those patients with &quot;dry&quot; bronchiectasis (ie, not associated with sputum production).

Bronchial carcinoid, a highly vascular tumor that is unrelated to smoking, should be considered in a young or middle-aged nonsmoker with recurrent hemoptysis. In patients with AIDS, Kaposi's sarcoma involving the airways <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> the pulmonary parenchyma) is a potential cause of hemoptysis.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Causes of hemoptysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An essential initial step in the evaluation is to determine whether the patient has massive hemoptysis. The term <strong>massive hemoptysis</strong> is reserved for bleeding that is potentially acutely life-threatening. In our clinical practice, we define massive hemoptysis as either &ge;500 mL of expectorated blood over a 24 hour period or bleeding at a rate &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. The evaluation and management of massive hemoptysis is described separately. (See <a href=\"#H277113488\" class=\"local\">'Definition of massive hemoptysis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-massive-hemoptysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of massive hemoptysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Causes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of hemoptysis should begin with the initial history and physical examination and assessment of oxygenation. Important features of the history include age, smoking history, duration and quantity of hemoptysis, and association with symptoms of acute bronchitis or an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis (change in sputum, blood streaking superimposed upon purulent sputum) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96529\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96529 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96530\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96530 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies which may be useful depending upon the particular clinical situation include <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit,</span> platelet count, a coagulation profile, urinalysis, blood urea nitrogen, plasma creatinine concentration, and collection of sputum for microbiologic studies. A plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) may be helpful if heart failure is a suspected contributor, while a D-dimer test would help to screen for pulmonary embolism. (See <a href=\"#H296832427\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important initial study, beyond history and physical examination, for all patients presenting with hemoptysis is a chest radiograph. Abnormal findings may be suggestive of a variety of specific causes of hemoptysis, ranging from primary lung neoplasm to focal infection (tuberculosis, aspergilloma) to mitral stenosis with pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"#H296832458\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No immediate further work-up is indicated if the clinical picture is not suggestive of carcinoma (negative chest radiograph, age less than 40 years, no smoking history, and hemoptysis less than one week duration), particularly if acute bronchitis (blood streaking superimposed upon purulent sputum) seems likely. Such a patient should be treated for bacterial bronchitis (if indicated) and observed for recurrence of hemoptysis following improvement in purulent sputum production. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Patients with a normal chest radiograph'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further evaluation is indicated if the patient has any of the above risk factors for carcinoma or if the hemoptysis is recurrent or associated with radiographic abnormalities. Chest computed tomography, either high resolution or multidetector (HRCT or MDCT), and flexible bronchoscopy are complementary procedures, although CT is often performed first as it is less invasive, has a higher diagnostic rate, and can help direct the selection of sampling procedures and location. HRCT is the preferred next procedure in patients at lower risk for tumor or chronic bronchitis but with a history or radiograph suggestive of bronchiectasis or an arteriovenous malformation. (See <a href=\"#H30863142\" class=\"local\">'Active hemoptysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with recurrent hemoptysis and a normal HRCT scan, flexible bronchoscopy may yield a diagnosis. If bronchoscopy is negative, pseudohemoptysis has been excluded, and the patient is not on anticoagulant therapy, the patient is considered to have cryptogenic hemoptysis. (See <a href=\"#H345735380\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent hemoptysis with normal HRCT'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-hemoptysis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Jean-Baptiste E.
