The cutaneous manifestations of DM may also develop in the absence of detectable muscle disease, and can persist after the successful treatment of DM-associated myositis.</p><p>Patients with DM often present with intensely pruritic areas of confluent, violaceous erythema on the scalp, face, upper trunk, and upper extremities. Pruritus can be disabling. </p><p>Skin lesions of DM are often resistant to photoprotection and topical therapies alone, necessitating the initiation of antimalarial drugs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. Patients who fail to respond to these interventions may require more aggressive immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. </p><p>The initial management of the cutaneous manifestations of DM will be discussed here. The treatment of refractory DM, as well as the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of the noncutaneous manifestations of DM and juvenile DM are reviewed elsewhere.

Violaceous erythema involving the periorbital skin (heliotrope eruption), scalp, V of the neck, shoulders, extensor surfaces of the upper extremities, upper chest, and upper back are additional characteristic findings in DM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F56879%7EDERM%2F68649%7EDERM%2F54230%7EDERM%2F77822\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56879 graphicRef68649 graphicRef54230 graphicRef77822 \">picture 2A-D</a>).

Additional examples of cutaneous manifestations of DM include poikiloderma, calcinosis cutis, prominent periungual telangiectasias, and cuticular hypertrophy.

Similar to findings in lupus erythematosus, significantly reduced minimal erythema doses (MEDs, the minimal irradiation dose required to elicit cutaneous erythema) to ultraviolet B (UVB) light have been detected in patients with DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Patients frequently experience debilitating symptoms of severe pruritus or burning in affected areas, which can result in emotional distress and loss of sleep.

In one systematic review of primarily adult patients with cutaneous DM without myositis, the mean duration of skin disease was 4.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

However, a subset of patients develops characteristic skin findings of DM in the absence of muscle symptoms. This group is often referred to as clinically amyopathic DM (CADM) and contains both patients who lack clinical findings of myositis, but have evidence for myositis on laboratory, radiologic, or electrophysiologic studies (hypomyopathic DM), and patients in whom all signs of muscle involvement are absent (amyopathic DM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is estimated that 9 to 13 percent of patients with CADM for more than six months eventually develop classic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

However, the onset of cutaneous disease can precede the appearance of myositis by up to several months in 30 percent of patients with classic DM, and follows shortly after muscle involvement in 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The term &quot;premyopathic DM&quot; is used to describe patients who have no clinical evidence for muscle disease, but have had cutaneous manifestations of DM for less than six months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2068610\"><span class=\"h2\">Amyopathic DM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, amyopathic DM was known as dermatomyositis sin&eacute; myositis. This variant is considered a distinct form of DM, rather than classic DM in which the onset of muscle involvement is delayed for a prolonged period. Amyopathic DM is diagnosed in patients who lack muscle weakness and have no laboratory or radiologic signs of myositis despite the presence of cutaneous findings consistent with DM for at least six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of note, the use of immunosuppressive drugs for cutaneous DM for two consecutive months or longer within the first six months of skin disease may prevent the development of clinically significant myositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, the presence of drug-induced DM-like cutaneous changes, such as can occur with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a>, must be excluded. </p><p>Approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients with DM seen in academic health centers have amyopathic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The proportion may be higher among patients referred to dermatologists; in one dermatology referral center, approximately 40 percent of patients with DM had the amyopathic variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2068617\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypomyopathic DM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to amyopathic DM, hypomyopathic DM presents with cutaneous findings consistent with DM and the absence of clinically appreciable muscle weakness for at least six months after the appearance of skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In contrast to amyopathic disease, subclinical evidence for myositis is evident through serologic testing for muscle enzymes, electromyography (EMG), muscle biopsy, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p>Hypomyopathic DM is less common than amyopathic DM; among 281 patients with CADM in a systematic review, 37 (13 percent) had hypomyopathic disease, and 197 (70 percent) had amyopathic DM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2068718\"><span class=\"h2\">Postmyopathic DM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In classic DM, cutaneous and muscle disease often have a discordant response to therapy.

However, in patients who present with ambiguous cutaneous findings or cutaneous findings that are suggestive of DM in the absence of clinical signs of muscle disease, a skin biopsy should be performed. </p><p>The histopathologic findings in DM are variable, but typically include an interface dermatitis characterized by vacuolization of basal keratinocytes, a lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis, and dermal mucin. The biopsy is useful for ruling out other disorders that may resemble DM, including seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, polymorphous light eruption, and papulosquamous disorders such as lichen planus or psoriasis.

The histopathologic findings of DM are often indistinguishable from ACLE. Of note, the intense pruritus often associated with DM usually does not occur in patients with ACLE. In addition, ACLE traditionally spares the nasolabial folds, while DM often involves these areas.

Due to the possibility of subsequent development of muscle disease, patients without myositis should be evaluated with a muscle examination and serum creatinine kinase and aldolase levels every two to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Thus, patients should be evaluated and followed for the presence of these disorders. In a systematic review that analyzed 291 adult patients with CADM, 36 (13 percent) developed interstitial lung disease, and 41 cases (14 percent) were found to be associated with internal malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Therapy for cutaneous disease is usually indicated due to the presence of severe pruritus and patient distress over the appearance of skin lesions. It is unknown whether early aggressive treatment of amyopathic DM influences risk for muscle or organ involvement.</p><p>Data on therapies for cutaneous manifestations of DM are limited, and most data regarding this indication are in the form of case reports and retrospective reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The frequent inclusion of patients with different variants of DM within studies (eg, both adult and juvenile DM or both classic and amyopathic DM) and the concomitant administration of immunosuppressive therapies for muscle disease in many studies have made it difficult to interpret the available literature. Data on true monotherapy, particularly in the absence of concomitant topical or systemic glucocorticoids, are virtually nonexistent. </p><p>The historical lack of standardized measures to assess responses to therapy has also compromised the systematic interpretation of published literature. The consistent use of validated, objective measures of response to therapy, such as the Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index, will be useful for interpreting the results of future studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2068757\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A multipronged approach to treatment often is necessary to achieve a satisfactory response in patients with cutaneous DM. </p><p>Our initial approach to patients with cutaneous DM consists of four elements: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive <strong>photoprotection</strong> to reduce the exacerbating effects of ultraviolet light</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antipruritic agents</strong> to manage the associated (and often severe) pruritus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors</strong> for local treatment of skin manifestations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic medications</strong> aimed at attaining sustained control of the disease</p><p/><p>A small subset of patients with mild cutaneous DM can achieve satisfactory improvement with the first three interventions.

Group I topical corticosteroids are often used to treat the hands, extensor surfaces, and scalp, where the risk of corticosteroid-induced cutaneous atrophy is low, while lower potency agents (group VI to VII) are used for disease in areas that are more prone to atrophy, such as facial erythema and the heliotrope eruption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Daily application with occlusion (ie, coverage of the site of application by a bandage, gloves, or other dressing) increases the penetration and potency of topical corticosteroids, and the use of high potency topical corticosteroids under occlusion may be beneficial for refractory hyperkeratotic lesions, particularly those on the dorsal hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-cutaneous-dermatomyositis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

For patients with severe cutaneous disease we favor the addition of methotrexate over the addition of quinacrine as our experience suggests that treatment with hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate typically provides a more substantial response than combination antimalarials in patients with cutaneous DM. Methotrexate also may be used alone for patients who cannot tolerate antimalarial therapy. Therapeutic options for patients who fail to respond to antimalarials and methotrexate are reviewed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H377280\" class=\"local\">'Overview of clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on treatment options for the cutaneous manifestations of DM are limited. Photoprotection, management of pruritus, and topical therapy are important components of management. Most patients also require systemic therapy to achieve control of cutaneous DM. (See <a href=\"#H2068757\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with cutaneous manifestations with DM, we suggest the use of topical corticosteroids for initial pharmacologic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Topical calcineurin inhibitors are an additional option for topical treatment. (See <a href=\"#H13069036\" class=\"local\">'Photoprotection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H377187\" class=\"local\">'Interventions for pruritus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H377239\" class=\"local\">'Topical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who fail to respond to photoprotection, interventions for pruritus, and topical therapy or who cannot be managed with these interventions alone because of prominent cutaneous disease or symptoms, we suggest the initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients who do not improve sufficiently with hydroxychloroquine therapy, we suggest the addition of quinacrine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We prefer the addition of methotrexate for patients with severe cutaneous DM based upon personal experience that suggests a better likelihood of response to therapy with this agent. (See <a href=\"#H11395989\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> also can be given without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>. The drug is an alternative to hydroxychloroquine for patients who cannot tolerate antimalarial drugs. In addition, because methotrexate is effective as a glucocorticoid-sparing agent for muscle disease of DM, the drug is an accepted choice for cutaneous DM in patients who require methotrexate for muscle involvement. (See <a href=\"#H13069078\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic glucocorticoids are not indicated for the initial management of cutaneous DM. The response to systemic glucocorticoids is unpredictable, and the adverse effects associated with long-term therapy limit the use of these drugs for cutaneous DM.
