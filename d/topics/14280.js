The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; will be used throughout this topic as a general term to cover transplantation of hematopoietic cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infection in HCT recipients is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Viruses of major importance in HCT recipients include herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), respiratory viruses (eg, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus), human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Antiviral prophylaxis or preemptive therapy against some of these viruses is recommended for HCT recipients and will be discussed here. An overview of infections following HCT, evaluation for infections before HCT, prophylaxis of other infections in HCT recipients, and immunizations in HCT candidates and recipients are presented separately.

Laboratory testing for evidence of past infectious exposures is performed to detect asymptomatic infection in the HCT donor or candidate. Some tests are recommended for all HCT donors and candidates, whereas others are appropriate in selected individuals with epidemiologic risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56453 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].

The timing and length of interval of each of these phases may vary according to the source of stem cells, degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and minor histocompatability antigen match, the type and intensity of conditioning regimen used, and any manipulation the graft has had prior to transplant, immunosuppressive therapy (especially glucocorticoids), and the presence of graft-versus-host disease. In general, allogeneic HCT recipients are at risk for infection during all three periods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52716 \">figure 1</a>), whereas autologous transplant recipients are typically only vulnerable to infection during the pre- and immediate postengraftment periods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64491\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64491 \">figure 2</a>). During each of these time periods, patients can develop bacterial, fungal, viral, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parasitic infections, although during each period certain pathogens tend to cause disease more than others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50318\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50318 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The timeline for infections is discussed in greater detail separately.

The goal of preemptive therapy is to avoid progression to invasive disease. Preemptive therapy may be favored over prophylaxis when the antimicrobial therapy is particularly toxic (eg, for cytomegalovirus).

Prophylactic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> preemptive strategies are employed for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and -2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1058289478\"><span class=\"h2\">Herpes simplex virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We test all HCT candidates for HSV-1 and HSV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies prior to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. HCT recipients who are seropositive for HSV-1 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HSV-2 should receive antiviral prophylaxis during the early transplant period. The usual approach involves starting an antiviral agent when the conditioning regimen is started and continuing it until engraftment or until mucositis resolves, whichever is longer; most patients require HSV prophylaxis for approximately 30 days following transplantation. We give a longer course to patients with a history of frequent recurrences of HSV. It should be noted that VZV prophylaxis is necessary for a substantially longer period, as discussed below. Some centers do not routinely check HSV antibodies in patients who are VZV-seropositive since all VZV-seropositive patients require antiviral prophylaxis and a large proportion of patients are VZV seropositive. (See <a href=\"#H1058289500\" class=\"local\">'Varicella-zoster virus'</a> below.)</p><p>Acceptable options for HSV prophylaxis include intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 12 hours or 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> IV every 12 hours) or, if tolerated, oral acyclovir (800 mg twice daily) or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> (500 mg twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/1,2,5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5-9</a>].

A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials of antiviral prophylaxis (mostly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>) compared with placebo during the preengraftment period in HCT recipients demonstrated a reduction in HSV disease rates in those who received prophylaxis (relative risk 0.19, 95% CI 0.11-0.31), but no reduction in overall mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Most VZV infections after HCT are due to reactivation of endogenous virus in seropositive patients.

Some clinicians recommend continuation of prophylaxis for six months after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy, but this has not been adequately studied. If VZV reactivation occurs beyond the period at risk, a treatment course should be completed and prophylaxis should then be resumed and continued for at least six months after all T cell suppressive therapies have been stopped.</p><p>VZV prophylaxis following allogeneic HCT has been shown to be effective in VZV-seropositive patients in at least two randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In the larger of these trials, 77 allogeneic HCT recipients were randomly assigned to receive oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> (800 mg twice daily) or placebo given from one to two months until one year following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Acyclovir significantly reduced VZV infections at one year (hazard ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.04-0.74), but it did not reduce mortality. There was no difference between the groups in VZV-specific T helper cell responses, indicating that antiviral prophylaxis does not impede the development of protective immune responses. Post-study VZV disease primarily occurred in patients with continued need for systemic immunosuppression, suggesting that continuation of prophylaxis beyond one year might be beneficial in such patients.</p><p>The potential benefit of a longer course of VZV prophylaxis was addressed in a retrospective population-based study of three sequential cohorts of 2635 VZV-seropositive patients who were undergoing allogeneic or autologous HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The first cohort received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> from the day of transplantation until engraftment, the second cohort received acyclovir or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> for one year, and the third cohort received acyclovir or valacyclovir for one year or for six months after immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued, whichever was longer.</p><p>The following findings were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consistent with the findings in the randomized trials, prophylaxis for one year or longer significantly reduced VZV disease compared with prophylaxis only through engraftment (8.8 versus 25 percent in allogeneic HCT recipients; 8.2 versus 22 percent in autologous HCT recipients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The magnitude of benefit after one year of prophylaxis persisted after drug discontinuation compared with patients who received prophylaxis only through engraftment.

Hence, all HCT recipients should avoid exposure to potentially contagious individuals who have been exposed to VZV, particularly between days 10 to 21 after that individual's exposure or until all skin lesions have crusted. Because individuals infected with the VZV are contagious for 24 to 48 hours before the typical rash develops, it is difficult to prevent transmission of VZV to susceptible hosts.</p><p>VZV-seronegative HCT recipients who were transplanted within the previous 24 months, as well as those transplanted &gt;24 months earlier requiring continued immunosuppression (eg, for chronic GVHD), should be given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella-zoster immune globulin</a> (VariZIG) within 10 days of contact with a person with either chickenpox or shingles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>]. In addition, VZV-seronegative patients undergoing conditioning for HCT who are exposed to an individual who has a varicella-like rash following varicella vaccination should receive VariZIG. Close contact for adults is defined as continuous household contact, hospital contact in the same two- to four-bed room, or prolonged face-to-face contact with an infectious individual.</p><p>HCT recipients who were seropositive prior to transplantation <strong>and</strong> who are highly immunosuppressed due to high-dose glucocorticoid therapy or a T cell-depleted allograft <strong>and</strong> who are exposed to an individual with chickenpox, shingles, or a post-vaccine varicella-like rash should also receive VariZIG.</p><p>If VariZIG is not available, postexposure <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> (1 g orally three times daily) should be given from exposure until day 22 following exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Details regarding formulation and dosing of VariZIG and antivirals are discussed separately.

Although some autologous HCT recipients reactivate CMV, the incidence of CMV disease is low in these patients. The risk of posttransplant CMV infection and CMV disease is significantly influenced by both donor and recipient CMV serostatus, which is determined before transplant; serostatus is used to help determine the appropriate prophylaxis or preemptive strategy. The lowest risk of posttransplant CMV is in CMV-seronegative recipients given grafts from CMV-seronegative donors. Hence, selection of the donor with the most appropriate CMV serologic status is a key preventive measure in an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling setting. However, when performing transplantation from an unrelated donor, the HLA match (especially an antigen-matched donor for HLA-A, B, or DR) supersedes CMV serostatus. Umbilical cord blood grafts contain few memory T cells and, hence, generally offer no protection against CMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A CMV match should generally be prioritized over other factors such as blood group or age.</p><p>Recipients who are CMV-seropositive are at greatest risk for the development of CMV disease after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This is especially true when given grafts from CMV-seronegative donors due to lack of donor-transferred CMV-specific immunity during host reactivation of endogenous latent CMV. Accordingly, CMV-seropositive patents should be monitored closely for CMV reactivation and either given CMV prophylaxis or preemptive therapy as discussed below.</p><p>Donor selection for HCT is discussed in greater detail separately.

To prevent transfusion-transmitted CMV disease in CMV-seronegative recipients whose donor is also CMV-seronegative, blood products that are CMV safe (either obtained from CMV-seronegative donors or leukocyte depleted) should be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Intravenous immunoglobulin and CMV-specific immunoglobulin prophylaxis have limited, if any, effect on the prevention of primary CMV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]; we recommend against their use.</p><p>It is important to prevent CMV disease in CMV-seropositive recipients who receive grafts from either CMV-seronegative or CMV-seropositive donors and in CMV-seronegative recipients who receive allografts from CMV-seropositive donors.

There is no consensus on the most appropriate approach, and the decision of whether to give prophylactic or preemptive therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the risk profile of each patient.

It is important to note that although survival improvement in individual ganciclovir trials was not seen, the trials were underpowered to detect survival differences. However, in an observational study, patients who received prophylactic ganciclovir had a survival benefit compared with patients who did not receive either antiviral prophylaxis or preemptive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=letermovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Letermovir</a> is an anti-CMV agent with a novel mechanism of action; it inhibits the viral terminase subunit pUL56, a component of the terminase complex involved in DNA cleavage and packaging that has no equivalent target enzyme in the human body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The reduction in incidence of all-cause prophylaxis failure was dose dependent. All-cause prophylaxis failure was defined as discontinuation of the study drug because of virologic failure or for any other reason (eg, an adverse event, nonadherence, or withdrawal of consent). The incidence of all-cause prophylaxis failure was 29 percent with 240 mg of letermovir, 32 percent with 120 mg of letermovir, 48 percent with 60 mg of letermovir, and 64 percent with placebo; the difference between letermovir and placebo was statistically significant for the 240 and 120 mg doses but not for the 60 mg dose. UL56 genotyping was performed on the blood of 12 patients enrolled in the trial who had virologic failure; a letermovir-resistance mutation, UL56 V236M, was identified in the blood of one patient who received 60 mg of letermovir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This mutation likely arose by mutation of a replicating wild-type virus at a suboptimal letermovir dose.</p><p>In a multicenter phase III trial, 495 CMV-seropositive allogeneic HCT recipients with undetectable CMV viral loads received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letermovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letermovir</a> 480 mg daily (or 240 mg daily if receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> given drug-drug interaction) for CMV prophylaxis or placebo beginning within the first 28 days after HCT and continuing through week 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. By 24 weeks following HCT, fewer patients receiving letermovir developed clinically significant CMV (defined as CMV disease or CMV viremia leading to preemptive therapy) compared with those who received placebo (37.5 versus 60.6 percent). Among those who developed clinically significant CMV infection, most had CMV viremia rather than CMV disease. CMV viremia resulting in preemptive therapy occurred in 52 of 325 patients receiving letermovir (16.0 percent) and 68 of 170 patients receiving placebo (40.0 percent). CMV disease occurred in 5 of 325 patients receiving letermovir (1.5 percent) and 3 of 170 patients receiving placebo (1.8 percent) and involved the gastrointestinal tract in all patients. One patient had breakthrough CMV viremia during letermovir treatment; CMV genotyping revealed that the CMV isolate had the letermovir-resistance mutation, UL56 V236M. </p><p>All-cause mortality at week 24 following HCT was lower in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letermovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letermovir</a> recipients compared with placebo recipients (10.2 versus 15.9 percent), a difference that was statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. All-cause mortality at week 48 following HCT was lower in letermovir recipients (20.9 versus 25.5 percent), but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no statistically significant mortality difference in either the high-risk or the low-risk subgroup at week 48. The prevention of clinically significant CMV infection by letermovir was consistent in high-risk and low-risk patients, but the lower mortality in letermovir recipients was more pronounced in high-risk patients than low-risk patients. High-risk patients were defined as those having a related donor with at least one mismatch at one of the specified three HLA gene loci (HLA A, B, or DR), having an unrelated donor at one of the specified four HLA gene loci (HLA A, B, C, or DRB1), having a haploidentical donor, receiving umbilical cord blood as the stem cell source, receiving a T cell-depleted allograft, or having GVHD of grade &ge;2 that led to the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (or its equivalent) at a dose of &ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day.</p><p>Time to engraftment was similar in those who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letermovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letermovir</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Letermovir was associated with a modestly higher incidence of vomiting (18.5 versus 13.5 percent) and edema (14.5 versus 9.4 percent) than placebo. Acute kidney injury occurred in 9.7 percent of letermovir recipients and 13.0 percent of placebo recipients. Atrial fibrillation or flutter was reported in 4.6 percent of patients receiving letermovir compared with 1.0 percent of patients receiving placebo, but further analysis did not show a relationship with letermovir exposure.</p><p>There are several considerations that should be kept in mind. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letermovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Letermovir</a> appears to avoid the myelosuppressive effects and other toxicities of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a>, a significant advantage. Letermovir has important interactions with commonly used immunosuppressive drugs due to effects on cytochrome P4503A and organic anion transporters. Letermovir increases <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> exposure, and the levels of these drugs should be monitored and the dose reduced as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Additionally, there are interactions with drugs that are inhibitors of organic transporters, including some anti-cancer drugs, particularly tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which may be used after HCT in some patients. There are many other drug interactions described in the package insert and likely even more will be identified with more study (and use) of this drug over time. These pharmacologic attributes are important to consider for the safe use of this drug.</p><p>There are several other important caveats. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letermovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Letermovir</a> is active against CMV but does not have activity against other herpesviruses, including HSV and VZV. Thus, clinicians will need to provide prophylaxis against these viruses when indicated. The letermovir prophylaxis trial used a lower threshold of CMV DNAemia (&gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> for high-risk patients and &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> for low-risk patients through week 14 after HCT; &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> for all patients thereafter) than most centers use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The results for CMV DNAemia were reported in <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL;</span> 1 international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/mL</span> in the assay used corresponded to 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>. There was no difference in CMV disease between the two groups. While mortality was higher at 24 weeks in the placebo group, the mortality at 48 weeks was not significantly different. The study's definition of high-risk versus low-risk patients is likely to be a subject of debate. For example, it is not clear why antithymocyte globulin (ATG) use was not deemed to confer high risk, and some would argue that haploidentical HCT recipients receiving post-transplant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (as opposed to T cell depletion of the donor graft) are not at high risk for CMV disease. However, letermovir appeared to have an antiviral benefit in both patients given ATG and in haploidentical transplant patients (although using different preemptive trigger thresholds). Given these considerations, a clear recommendation is difficult to make as to the merits of letermovir prophylaxis versus preemptive therapy. As noted above, for centers that use CMV prophylaxis in high-risk patients, we would favor letermovir for safety reasons over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a>.</p><p>The following investigational agents have been evaluated for CMV prophylaxis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brincidofovir (CMX001)</strong> &ndash; Brincidofovir is an investigational orally bioavailable lipid acyclic nucleoside phosphonate that is converted intracellularly to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cidofovir</a>; unlike cidofovir, brincidofovir is not concentrated in the renal proximal tubules and is therefore not nephrotoxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Brincidofovir is approximately 400 times more potent than cidofovir in vitro against CMV, including ganciclovir-resistant strains. In a multicenter phase II trial, 230 CMV-seropositive allogeneic HCT recipients were randomly assigned to receive brincidofovir (dosed orally at 40 mg weekly, 100 mg weekly, 200 mg weekly, 100 mg twice weekly, or 200 mg twice weekly) or placebo starting between 14 and 30 days following HCT and continuing until week 13 post-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-viral-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

There was also a trend toward higher mortality in the brincidofovir group. Both the failure to prevent CMV infections and the trend toward increased mortality in the brincidofovir group appeared to be driven by confirmed cases of GVHD, which resulted in a significantly higher use of glucocorticoids than in the control group.

HCT donors should also be tested for HCV antibodies. HCV antibody-positive individuals should be further assessed for the chronic hepatitis C with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for HCV RNA. As with hepatitis B, hepatitis C-infected HCT candidates should undergo evaluation for chronic liver disease because it can increase transplant-related morbidity and mortality. If HCV RNA testing is negative, then the candidate has cleared HCV infection and is not at risk for HCV-related complications. If the HCV RNA is detectable, the candidate has chronic HCV infection. The HCV genotype should be determined in such patients. Assessment of the degree of liver fibrosis with noninvasive serologic and radiographic tests (eg, FibroSure test and ultrasound-based elastography) should be performed in all HCV-infected patients since this will impact decisions related to the HCT conditioning regimen and HCV treatment regimen.
