As the largest articulation and the one most frequently affected by chronic inflammation, the knee is the joint most often selected for synovectomy. Open surgical, chemical, radiation, and arthroscopic synovectomies are all options for removing potentially damaging synovium from the knee.</p><p>There are various disorders that are indications for synovectomy. Among them are chronic inflammatory arthritides (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Lyme arthritis), benign neoplastic disorders (eg, osteochondromatosis, tenosynovial giant cell tumor [formerly pigmented villonodular synovitis]), and recurrent hemarthrosis (eg, hemophilia). (See appropriate topics.)</p><p>Surgical debridement of synovial tissue, either open or arthroscopic, is also indicated for the treatment of some joint infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The role of synovectomy in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory arthritis of the knee is reviewed here. Synovectomy has a limited role in treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, and the use of arthroscopy in that setting is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical therapy of knee and hip osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In chronic inflammatory arthritis of the knee, microbiologic and histopathologic examination of synovium may be useful in diagnostic and prognostic studies. Arthroscopically guided synovial biopsy is an attractive alternative to closed needle biopsy techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Synovial biopsy and joint examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthroscopic synovial biopsy, as well as articular and synovial examination, may provide useful prognostic information concerning disease progression among patients with inflammatory arthritis. Establishing the stage in the progression of changes from effusion and synovial proliferation with hyperemia through pannus formation with cartilaginous erosions to bony erosions allows some prediction of the efficacy of treatments, such as arthroscopic debridement or synovectomy, and of the likelihood of the need for eventual joint replacement. As an example, one study of 26 knees in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (five knees), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (18 knees), or psoriatic arthritis (three knees) used arthroscopy and clinical examination to assess the efficacy of open synovectomy in the knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Arthroscopy included synovial biopsy for immunohistologic evaluation. The absence or low incidence of immunoglobulin A (IgA)-positive plasma cells in biopsies of knee synovium, as well as the amount of fibrin in the superficial layer 12 months after the synovectomy, suggested a less aggressive disease process and predicted a more reliable outcome after synovectomy. However, preoperative biopsies and those done six months after synovectomy were not predictive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYNOVECTOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Open synovectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The beneficial role of open synovectomy of the knee has been clearly demonstrated for inflammatory arthritis, hemophilic synovitis, tenosynovial giant cell tumor (formerly pigmented villonodular synovitis), and synovial chondromatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. By ablating the synovial joint lining, this operative technique reduces inflammation, thereby reducing pain, swelling, and loss of joint motion. Synovectomy should be considered when medical management for a minimum of six months fails to control synovitis and pain. However, open synovectomy of the knee may result in significant morbidity; it is also associated with prolonged hospitalization and rehabilitation and may cause significant blood loss.</p><p>The long-term results of multiple studies of open synovectomy indicate that the procedure, although effective in temporarily relieving pain, is primarily palliative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/1-3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report evaluated the efficacy of synovectomy in 78 knees among 55 patients with rheumatoid arthritis followed for a minimum of 10 years after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Seventy-five of the knees had moderate or severe pain preoperatively. Surgery resulted in significant pain relief, as only 24 of the 75 knees continued to have moderate or severe pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Symptom relief was more reliable in patients who underwent surgery prior to the development of significant radiographic evidence of degenerative change. However, surgery failed to halt disease progression; no significant difference in joint space narrowing was observed between the two knees of patients in whom surgery was performed on only one knee.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The failure to delay the deterioration of secondary degenerative changes leads to knee replacement in many patients within a few years after synovectomy. In one study of 83 cases of knee synovectomy for rheumatoid arthritis, over 50 percent had undergone an osteotomy or total knee replacement at five years after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective five-year clinical follow-up study of open synovectomy in chronic inflammatory joint disease employed arthroscopic examination of the joint before, six months after, and 12 months after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients were found to have decreased pain and swelling for up to six months after the procedure. The amount of wear on visual examination of the articular cartilage was the best predictor of good outcome, and those with recurrent synovitis at 12 months did worse at five-year follow-up. Patients with absent or low numbers of immunoglobulin A (IgA)-positive plasma cells on histologic examination of the synovium had better clinical scores at five years.</p><p/><p>In light of the temporary nature of the procedure and the high cost and complication rate of the open synovectomy technique, additional techniques have been introduced to avoid the open procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Arthroscopic synovectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthroscopic synovectomy, in the hands of a skilled arthroscopist, produces results comparable to open synovectomy, but with decreased morbidity and with considerably decreased cost. The procedure is associated with a decreased rate of infection, causes little if any loss of motion of the knee as long as early range of motion is encouraged, and can usually be performed in the outpatient setting, unless medical conditions require inpatient observation postoperatively.</p><p>Arthroscopic synovectomy is performed under general or spinal anesthesia, and a tourniquet is used. The knee is distended using a pressure irrigation system. The procedure requires considerable patience and a systematic approach to ensure that as much synovium as possible is removed. A specialized suction shaver and use of multiple portals, including posterior portals, facilitate a more complete excision. The posterior portals have significant associated risks of neurovascular damage, particularly to the saphenous vein and nerve. Care must be exercised to ensure that the excision is not too deep since this may promote scarring and subsequent loss of motion.</p><p>Because the excision, particularly posteriorly, may be incomplete, an open synovectomy using anterior and posterior incisions is recommended in the treatment of tenosynovial giant cell tumor when there is a significant bulk of abnormal tissue. Otherwise, recurrence will lead to an early resumption of symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antineoplastic therapy for miscellaneous benign diseases affecting soft tissue and bone&quot;, section on 'Tenosynovial giant cell tumor'</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of arthroscopic synovectomy was evaluated in one study of 96 patients with a variety of inflammatory arthritic disorders who underwent arthroscopic synovectomy because of at least six months of persistent synovitis and effusion of the knee that did not respond to medical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Preoperatively, 56 percent had knee pain. At four years after the procedure, only 21 percent had pain, and 24 percent had a synovitis.</p><p>This study group was subsequently enlarged to 211 synovectomies and was followed over a period of 2 to 10 years after arthroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 112 rheumatoid knees responded better (80 percent characterized as good or excellent) than the 32 knees with other inflammatory arthritides, such as psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis (60 percent characterized as good or excellent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrence occurred in only 2 of 19 cases of tenosynovial giant cell tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no recurrences in 17 patients with synovial chondromatosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 31 knees with nonspecific or posttraumatic synovitis showed decreased synovitis, but only one-half had reduced pain and improved function.</p><p/><p>Arthroscopic synovectomy of the knee in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is, therefore, indicated after failure of an adequate trial of medical management for six months in a patient with persisting synovitis, with little or no degenerative changes on radiographs, and with functional class of I or II according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients with a greater functional impairment are usually candidates for more extensive surgery.</p><p>Arthroscopic or open synovectomy can also play a role in the management of the arthritic complications of hemophilia. One study of synovectomy in 13 knees in 11 patients (eight open and five arthroscopic) showed a reduction in recurrent hemarthroses at an average follow-up of two and eight years for the arthroscopic and open groups, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In most cases, arthroscopic synovectomy increased the range of motion, and open synovectomy reduced or did not affect the range of motion. The roentgenographic progression of disease decreased but did not stop after synovectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemarthrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemarthrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Laser synovial ablation may prove to be a useful modality in this setting. The effectiveness of a holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (holmium:YAG) laser system was assessed in 17 patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Symptomatic improvement was more likely in those with less severe joint space narrowing (Larsen grade I or II). The proper role for this technique requires further study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19430830\"><span class=\"h2\">Open versus arthroscopic synovectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthroscopic synovectomy may be associated with a greater risk of disease recurrence and radiologic progression than open synovectomy, although they appear to result in a comparable degree of pain relief. These techniques have not been compared in randomized trials, but they were compared indirectly in a 2011 meta-analysis of 58 studies involving 2589 patients (with mean follow-up of 6.1 years) who underwent open or arthroscopic synovectomy for rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Those undergoing arthroscopic synovectomy in the knees had a statistically significant lower risk of progression to total joint arthroplasty compared with those undergoing open synovectomy (11 versus 19 percent). Radiographic progression was statistically significantly less frequent in the elbow and knees in patients who underwent the arthroscopic procedures (66 versus 28 percent and 75 versus 55 percent, respectively). However, the proportion of patients reporting less pain was similar for the two groups in each of the joints studied (mean of 75 percent). Limitations of the analysis included the performance of the majority of the studies prior to the availability of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and the tendency of the arthroscopic studies to have been performed more recently than many of the open synovectomy studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81273043\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemical synovectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemical synovectomy utilizing intraarticular injection of osmium tetroxide (osmic acid) or alkylating agents has been used to perform a &ldquo;medical synovectomy&rdquo; in patients with synovial inflammation due to various disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, tenosynovial giant cell tumor, and ankylosing spondylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, concerns about potential mutagenicity of alkylating agents have limited enthusiasm for their use.</p><p>The possible value of osmium tetroxide synovectomy was illustrated in an uncontrolled consecutive series of 65 patients with various diseases causing persistent knee inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Aspiration of the symptomatic knee, with removal of as much fluid as possible, was followed by the injection of local anesthetic (10 mL of 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>). After the local anesthetic had taken effect, 10 mL of an aqueous solution of osmium tetroxide (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/10</span> mL) was instilled. Then, 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> hexacetonide were injected, and the needle was removed. Knee immobilization and bed rest for 24 hours were employed to reduce the risk of leakage. The following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Responses to the injections were good to excellent in 86 percent of patients when assessed six weeks following the injection. However, recurrence of synovitis occurred gradually, and 80 percent of injected knees were again inflamed three years following the initial injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse effects of osmium tetroxide chemical synovectomy included immediate postinjection pain in 12 percent of injections, skin burns at the site of needle insertion in 3 percent, and early &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; effusion that required aspiration.</p><p/><p>While chemical synovectomy with osmium tetroxide appears to be a generally safe technique for controlling synovitis of the knee that has not responded to other medical therapy, it is performed at only a few tertiary centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81273086\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation synovectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation synovectomy with the use of short-acting dysprosium-165-ferric hydroxide macro aggregates is an effective alternative to open synovectomy. One study, for example, found that 39 of 59 patients with rheumatoid arthritis at two-year follow-up had complete or almost complete relief of pain, a small or no effusion, and improved or no loss of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>By contrast, despite initial suggestions of efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], radiation synovectomy utilizing another radioisotope (yttrium-90) combined with intraarticular glucocorticoid injection may be no more effective than intraarticular glucocorticoids alone. This was illustrated in a study that randomly assigned the knees of 97 patients with chronic sterile synovitis to yttrium plus glucocorticoid (20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> hexacetonide or 40 mg of triamcinolone acetonide) and assessed a composite measure of clinical response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Yttrium plus glucocorticoids did not produce a greater response than intraarticular glucocorticoids alone (48 percent responded in each group), nor were the responses more durable. A subsequent study comparing the use of yttrium-90, phosphorus-32, or rhenium-188 with triamcinolone alone suggested comparable efficacy; however, a longer duration of pain relief was observed in the radiation synovectomy groups as compared with the triamcinolone group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Limited geographic availability and the experimental nature of this procedure in many locales limit the consideration of radiation synovectomy as a general solution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13884240\"><span class=\"h2\">Combined arthroscopic and radiation synovectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data from one study suggest that combined surgical and radiation synovectomy with yttrium-90 lead to a stable improvement in knee function for up to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, the combination of arthroscopic and radiation synovectomy has not been compared with either strategy alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81272601\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synovectomy refers to the destruction or surgical removal of the membrane (synovium) that lines a joint.
