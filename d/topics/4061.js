This was shown in a series of 93 consecutive clotted fistulas in which 100 percent had an underlying stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

For screening, noninvasive assessment is preferred to first identify fistulas with a high likelihood of stenosis.

Clinical monitoring may include routine examination of the fistula, monitoring for problems with dialysis, and monitoring <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. The effectiveness of these methods is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606472440\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2006 National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guidelines recommend that routine physical examination be performed on all mature fistulas on a weekly basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Such monitoring is also recommended by the 2008 Society for Vascular Surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Abnormalities of physical examination, such as extremity edema, alterations in the pulse, thrill, or bruit, may signal a problem with the fistula. Some experts suggest that failure of the fistula to collapse when the arm is elevated and lack of pulse augmentation are particularly suggestive of underlying stenosis; however, it is unclear whether the accuracy of these tests in detecting stenosis is reproducible at all dialysis centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Pulse augmentation may be more useful in relatively new fistulas compared with mature fistulas that are relatively more rigid.

Unlike clinical monitoring, each of the fistula surveillance methods requires specialized equipment or specially trained staff. Each relies upon the observation that progressive stenosis increases intra-fistula pressure (normalized for systemic blood pressure) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreases access blood flow rate. Thus, the theoretical advantage of access surveillance over clinical monitoring is that it is more likely to be consistent and reproducible. However, implementing an access surveillance program requires additional cost, which is not currently reimbursed in the United States. To justify the added expense, surveillance methods must prove that their use is associated with improved patency. The effectiveness of surveillance methods is reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606471854\"><span class=\"h2\">Intra-access flow rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flow monitoring is the optimal surveillance method for fistula stenosis due, most likely, to the fistula being a low pressure system. Methods to monitor flow rate are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring and surveillance of hemodialysis arteriovenous grafts to prevent thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Intra-access blood flow monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>In a randomized trial, the positive predictive value of flow monitoring for fistula stenosis was twice as good as that obtained with clinical monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The optimal threshold of access flow for detecting stenosis appears to be lower (approximately 450 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> for fistulas compared with grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. As an example, in one study, an access flow of 465 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> was associated with a sensitivity and false-positive rate of 0.89 and 0.32, respectively, for predicting fistula stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. We use an access flow rate less than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> as suggestive of underlying stenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627747979\"><span class=\"h2\">Duplex ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are only very limited data concerning the use of duplex ultrasonography in fistulas. Most of the studies have primarily evaluated patients with AV grafts, but data also suggest that duplex flow measurements may be useful for patients with native AVFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In a systematic review, four randomized trials evaluated access flow-based monitoring in native AVFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although access blood flow screening with Doppler ultrasound prevented access thrombosis in AVFs (relative risk 0.45, 95% CI 0.28-0.77), it did not reduce the risk of access loss or extent of resource use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606471860\"><span class=\"h2\">Static dialysis venous pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Static dialysis venous pressures have a lower positive predictive value for stenosis in fistulas as compared with grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. We do not consider static dialysis venous pressures to be useful for fistulas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of evidence concerning the effectiveness of clinical monitoring and surveillance for AVFs. Because thrombosis is much less common in fistulas than in grafts, it is more difficult to demonstrate a reduction in the rate of thrombosis or show a definitive improvement in patency rates.</p><p>In general, clinical monitoring, most commonly by dialysis nurses, is less accurate for AVFs compared with grafts to detect stenoses, although the evidence is conflicting. This may be due in part to the lower frequency of stenosis in AVFs than in grafts. Thus, negative fistulograms are not uncommon among patients referred for the study based upon abnormal clinical monitoring.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated 543 fistulograms in 358 grafts and 185 fistulas, which were prompted by abnormalities of clinical monitoring detected by dialysis nurses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The positive predictive value for greater than 50 percent stenosis was only 39 percent for fistulas as compared with 69 percent for grafts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The findings of a preprocedure physical examination were compared with results via angiography in a prospective trial of 142 consecutive patients with AVF dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of physical examination for outflow stenosis were 92 and 86 percent, respectively, and, for inflow stenosis, 85 and 71 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The examinations were performed by a nephrologist who was experienced in clinical access assessment, and it is unclear whether comparable results can be obtained by less experienced clinicians or dialysis nurses.</p><p/><p>Observational and nonrandomized studies are conflicting concerning any benefits for surveillance methods such as blood flow rate monitoring on fistula thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. On the other hand, the only randomized trial reported a significantly lower fistula failure rate in patients undergoing flow monitoring with preemptive angioplasty than in patients without surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In this trial, 79 patients with fistulas with a proven stenosis were randomly assigned to preemptive angioplasty, surgical revision, or a control group in which intervention was deferred until there was a decrease in <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> or the fistula clotted. Cumulative fistula survival was significantly higher in the intervention group. However, these findings may be limited because it was a single-center study, and the type of intervention may be important as the same group reported better patency with surgical revision than with angioplasty. Further study may be required to better understand the role of flow monitoring in patients with fistulas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606473275\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR ANGIOGRAPHY REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of high-quality evidence to guide clinical practice, our approach is consistent with the 2006 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) work group guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Multiple lesions can be detected in at least one-third of cases. In addition to defining the anatomy of the fistula, immediate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with or without stenting can be performed, if indicated, or the angiogram can serve as a guide for surgical revision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Monitoring of hemodialysis fistulas may involve routine clinical assessment or more elaborate surveillance programs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clinical monitoring falls into the following three broad categories: abnormalities of physical examination, problems noted during the dialysis session, or an unexplained decrease in the delivered dialysis dose <span class=\"nowrap\">(Kt/V)</span> on a constant hemodialysis prescription. Although not clearly reproducible, some experts suggest that failure of the fistula to collapse when the arm is elevated and the lack of pulse augmentation when the outflow vein is occluded transiently are particularly suggestive of underlying stenosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The three major types of access surveillance are intra-access blood flow monitoring, static dialysis venous pressure, and duplex ultrasound. Flow monitoring is the optimal surveillance method for fistula stenosis due most likely to the fistula being a low pressure system. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is insufficient evidence to support complex surveillance programs, and there is general agreement that simple clinical monitoring of fistula performance by dialysis center personnel is preferred. Given the lack of evidence suggesting efficacy with surveillance, the dialysis staff at our center performs physical examination of the fistula weekly and notes any abnormalities during the dialysis session. Routine clinical assessment should be supplemented with noninvasive testing prior to angiography. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiography should be reserved for patients with physical findings or other noninvasive evidence of probable fistula abnormalities. Similarly, an unexplained (&gt;0.2 units) or persistent decrease in <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> should prompt angiography.
