For most children, vascular changes, if present, are mild and can be minimized with adherence to a healthy lifestyle. However, in some children, the atherosclerotic process is accelerated because of the presence of identifiable risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109927 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-child-at-risk-for-atherosclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Identification of children who are at risk for accelerated atherosclerosis may allow timely intervention to decrease the atherosclerotic process, thereby preventing or delaying CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-the-child-at-risk-for-atherosclerosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>An overview of the management of the child identified as being at risk for atherosclerosis will be presented here.

As a result, intensive glycemic control is recommended for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes with age-specific goals for A1c levels. Similar recommendations are made for children with type 2 diabetes, particularly as these children are more commonly overweight and some believe their CVD risk may be higher.

Although data are available to estimate the risk-benefit of intervention for individual adults, such information for children is not currently available. In particular, the decision to intervene in children with multiple risk factors is challenging because evidence is often indirect, and the desire to limit the use of medications must be balanced against the benefits of global risk factor reduction. In addition, the thresholds for initiation of pharmacologic management of one risk factor may vary depending upon the severity of other risk factors, for example, the need for more stringent management of dyslipidemia in children with type I diabetes. Nonetheless, intervention is warranted in certain clinical circumstances, such as in children with very high low-density lipid (LDL) levels, as seen in familial hypercholesterolemia, or severe hypertension. In summary, therapeutic choices are based on the medical judgment of care providers based upon the best available data and the clinical setting, and the preference of patients and their families.

These risk factors include dyslipidemia, hypertension, overweight or obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, and smoke exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109927 \">table 1</a>).

Therapy includes nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions. The initiation and aggressiveness of the therapy are generally based upon the number of CVD risk factors and their severity (ie, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and overweight), and the preference of patients and their families.
