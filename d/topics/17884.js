Two species are recognized to cause paracoccidioidomycosis: <em>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</em> and <em>Paracoccidioides lutzii</em>. The fungus has a geographic distribution limited to Central and South America, and paracoccidioidomycosis is the most frequent systemic endemic mycosis in this region. Primary infection is usually transient and almost always devoid of clinical manifestations. If the infection is not contained by the host, the disease may evolve into one of two patterns: the chronic form, which represents reactivation of the primary infection and is most common, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">acute/subacute</span> form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paracoccidioidomycosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The treatment of paracoccidioidomycosis will be reviewed here. The mycology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis are discussed separately.

Only two randomized trials have been published, neither of which had sufficient power to assess response or cure rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paracoccidioidomycosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Itraconazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Itraconazole</a> has been used extensively in the treatment of paracoccidioidomycosis and results in high response rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> was first shown in a single-center noncomparative study in which 47 patients (45 with chronic disease) received itraconazole for a median duration of six months (range 3 to 24 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paracoccidioidomycosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The overall response rate (complete resolution or marked improvement) was 91 percent. Of 15 patients who were followed for 12 months post-therapy, none had a relapse.</p><p>In a randomized trial that included 42 patients with paracoccidioidomycosis (35 with chronic disease, 7 with acute disease), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> capsules (50 to 100 mg per day) were compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a> (200 to 400 mg per day) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfadiazine</a> (100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paracoccidioidomycosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. One of these agents was given for four to six months as determined by clinical response, followed by slow release sulfa (sulfamethoxypyridazine) until serologic testing became negative. The mean duration of therapy with the initial antifungal agent was 170 days for the itraconazole group, 164 days for the sulfadiazine group, and 154 days for the ketoconazole group. The mean total duration of therapy (including maintenance sulfa therapy) was 24, 28, and 31 months, respectively. Clinical responses were observed in all patients receiving itraconazole or sulfadiazine, and in all but one patient receiving ketoconazole.

Absorption of the capsule formulation is highly variable, requires gastric acidity, and is enhanced when the agent is taken with food. Thus, in patients who receive concomitant medications that decrease gastric acidity, blood levels are reduced. In contrast, the liquid formulation has better bioavailability, does not require an acidic environment, and is taken on an empty stomach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;, section on 'Pharmacokinetics'</a>.)</p><p>The factors that affect <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> pharmacokinetics, including drug interactions, absorption, and drug formulation, are discussed in detail separately.

Thirty-five patients with paracoccidioidomycosis received voriconazole (400 mg twice daily on the first day and 200 mg twice daily thereafter) and 18 received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> capsules (100 mg twice daily). All but one patient had the chronic form of paracoccidioidomycosis. The median duration of treatment was 169 days for patients treated with voriconazole and 200 days for patients treated with itraconazole. The response rates were similar in patients who received at least one dose of treatment (89 percent with voriconazole versus 94 percent with itraconazole) and in patients receiving &gt;6 months of treatment (100 percent in both groups). Thus, voriconazole appears to be as effective as itraconazole for the treatment of chronic paracoccidioidomycosis, although the small size of the study limits these findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common toxicities of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> include hepatotoxicity, photosensitivity skin rash, and transient visual disturbances.

In addition, several retrospective studies have found that more prolonged treatment is required with TMP-SMX (usually two years) compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paracoccidioidomycosis/abstract/1,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8-10</a>].

The groups were comparable with regards to age, gender, and the form of disease (acute or chronic). The cure rates were similar (94 and 95 percent for patients receiving TMP-SMX and itraconazole, respectively), but the median duration of treatment was shorter in patients receiving itraconazole (7 versus 24 months).

Amphotericin B deoxycholate is often avoided due to nephrotoxicity and the availability of less toxic agents. However, amphotericin B is the drug of choice for treating patients with sepsis due to <em>Paracoccidioides </em>spp (occasionally seen with the acute or subacute form of paracoccidioidomycosis) and patients with respiratory failure.

For children who cannot swallow capsules, the oral solution of itraconazole (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> once daily) or TMP-SMX (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day based on the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> component divided into two daily doses) should be used.

An alternative is intravenous TMP-SMX (8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of the TMP component divided into three daily doses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paracoccidioidomycosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Other options for severe disease are intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day). However, there are few data on the use of these agents for the treatment of severe paracoccidioidomycosis. Although the optimal dose of voriconazole has not been determined for the treatment of severe paracoccidioidomycosis, it would be reasonable to use doses similar to those used for other invasive fungal infections in patients with contraindications to the other possible agents, or for step-down therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;, section on 'Dosing'</a>.)</p><p>Patients treated initially with an intravenous drug can be switched to an oral agent once significant improvement in the clinical condition has been observed (resolution of hypotension, reduction of ascites, improvement of respiratory function and nutritional status). Such improvements are usually achieved after 20 to 40 days of intravenous therapy. The transition to an oral regimen should be made cautiously in patients with extensive abdominal involvement because oral absorption can be impaired due to edema of the intestinal wall, involvement of abdominal lymph nodes and fibrosis.

Patients with severe disease often require longer courses of therapy (&gt;2 years), even when itraconazole is used. Patients with central nervous system involvement, as well as immunocompromised hosts (eg, HIV infection, cancer, transplantation) may also require a longer duration of therapy.</p><p>The main therapeutic challenges in the management of paracoccidioidomycosis are the long duration of treatment, and the high frequency of relapse and sequelae (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Relapse'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-paracoccidioidomycosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic paracoccidioidomycosis&quot;, section on 'Sequelae'</a>). In addition, patients may have comorbidities that complicate the management of the disease. These include tuberculosis (in approximately 8 percent of patients with paracoccidioidomycosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paracoccidioidomycosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], enteric parasitic diseases, and others.</p><p>Treatment is usually continued until the clinical and radiological signs of paracoccidioidomycosis have improved substantially or resolved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64929\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64929 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61380\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61380 \">image 2</a>) and until there has been a significant reduction in antibody titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-paracoccidioidomycosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the presence of sequelae may complicate the interpretation of clinical and radiologic findings.

However, antibodies titers do not always correlate with either the clinical status of the patient or with response to therapy. As an example, some patients exhibit a transient increase in antibody titers after starting antifungal therapy, in spite of a good clinical response. Thus, serologic testing should be used in combination with other factors such as clinical and radiographic improvement in order to determine the treatment response and total duration of antifungal therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for laboratory studies during therapy depends upon the organs involved and the therapy used.
