Because <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> is easily visualized on Gram stain, which is classically the primary mode of evaluating urethral discharge in men, urethritis is traditionally classified as gonococcal versus nongonococcal in settings where microscopy is performed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22228515\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonococcal urethritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> is a relatively common cause of urethritis in the United States and Europe, especially in urban areas and sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics. </p><p>In a study of 768 men screened for sexually transmitted infections at 11 different clinic settings in the United States, the prevalence of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> ranged from 21.6 percent among symptomatic to 1.4 percent among asymptomatic men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The overall incidence of gonorrhea cases among men reported in the United States increased 22 percent in 2015 and 2016, with a rate of 170.1 cases per 100,000 men. These rate increases may be secondary to increased transmission, more comprehensive screening (ie, extragenital screening), or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, incidence varies substantially by race and geographical region. As examples, gonorrhea rates are disproportionately higher among black non-Hispanic men compared with white non-Hispanic men and are generally highest in the South compared with other regions in the country. </p><p>The burden of gonococcal urethritis may be even higher in certain regions of the developing world. As an example, in a study from South Africa, <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> was detected in 62 percent of men with symptoms of urethritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Of note, coinfections with other sexually transmitted pathogens are common. In a study of more than 3800 heterosexual men and women attending an STI clinic, chlamydial coinfection was demonstrated in 20 percent of men and 42 percent of women with gonorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p><em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> has also been reported as a cause of symptomatic urethritis clinically and microscopically similar to gonococcal urethritis in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In such cases, the source of the infection may be from asymptomatic carriage of the organism in the throat of an oral sex partner.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22228523\"><span class=\"h2\">Nongonococcal urethritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. trachomatis</em> is generally the most commonly identified cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), with <em>M. genitalium</em> the second most common; however, almost half of all cases of NGU do not have a specific etiology. Some studies suggest an association between NGU in men who have sex with men (MSM) and the bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Sexual practices may contribute to differences in causative agents of NGU in MSM compared to men who have sex with women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, the incidence of <em>C. trachomatis</em> in men has increased every year between 2000 and 2016, with the exceptions of 2012 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A 9.2 percent increase in the rate was reported for 2015 to 2016. The increases are likely due in part to more widespread (and comprehensive, including extragenital) testing with improved diagnostic tests. However, among NGU cases for which a pathogen is identified, the proportion caused by <em>C. trachomatis</em> appears to be decreasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Historically, <em>C. trachomatis</em> was estimated to be responsible for approximately 50 percent of cases of NGU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, subsequent studies using both culture and sensitive nucleic acid amplification testing methods have reported that chlamydia accounts for only 15 to 30 percent of NGU cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. This observation is likely a reflection of the use of a more diverse and sensitive set of diagnostic assays to detect other urethral pathogens, such as <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em> and <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>. </p><p>Although testing for <em>M. genitalium </em>is not universally available, it is estimated to cause approximately 15 to 20 percent of nongonococcal urethritis cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The proportion of cases of NGU attributable to different organisms varies by study and geographical region. In a study of 329 men in Australia with symptoms of urethritis, <em>C. trachomatis</em>, <em>M. genitalium</em>, adenoviruses, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) were detected in 20, 9, 4, and 3 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Of note, a pathogen was not identified in 65 percent of cases. In a trial of 305 men with symptomatic NGU in the United States, much higher prevalences were reported for <em>C. trachomatis</em>, <em>M. genitalium</em>, and <em>T. vaginalis</em> (43, 31, and 13 percent of men, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. <em>T. vaginalis</em> is an important cause of NGU in Africa, where the organism has been reported in up to 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>Certain pathogens may be associated with specific demographic or behavioral features. As examples, in the Australian study described above, HSV and adenovirus were detected more frequently among men who have sex with men and in association with a history of insertive oral sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/15,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21</a>]. In contrast, <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>M. genitalium</em> were associated with sex with women and unprotected vaginal sex. Insertive oral sex was also a significant risk factor in pathogen-negative NGU, suggesting that the oropharynx may be a significant source of other bacterial and viral pathogens.</p><p>Other organisms that can infrequently cause symptoms of urethritis include <em>Treponema pallidum</em>, as an endourethral syphilitic chancre may also lead to clinical urethritis, and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, which could be transmitted through respiratory secretions from a carrier during oral sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The role of <em>Ureaplasma urealyticum</em> and <em>Ureaplasma parvum</em> as urethral pathogens is unclear since these organisms can also be found as commensals in hosts with no evidence of disease. Several studies have identified an association between <em>Ureaplasma </em>spp and NGU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>], but others have not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/15,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,27</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections#H725181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections&quot;, section on 'Non-gonococcal urethritis'</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1458217\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysuria, or painful urination, is usually the chief complaint in men with urethritis and is reported in the majority of men with gonorrhea and over half of patients with nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Other complaints include pruritus, burning, and discharge at the urethral meatus. Urethral discharge can range from mucoid or watery to frankly purulent and may be present throughout the day or may be scanty and only present on the first morning void. Some men notice grossly visible mucous threads in their morning urine stream. The incubation period is variable, but is typically four to seven days after exposure for gonococcal urethritis and five to eight days for NGU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>However, not all men with laboratory evidence of urethritis have symptoms. Five to 10 percent of cases of gonococcal urethritis and up to 42 percent of NGU are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>On exam, discharge may be grossly evident or may only be detectable after gentle &quot;stripping&quot; or &quot;milking&quot; of the penis. The meatus may appear inflamed or edematous. Gram stain of the urethral discharge typically demonstrates an elevated number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56547\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56547 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H350862\" class=\"local\">'Gram stain of urethral sample'</a> below.)</p><p>Certain clinical features can suggest distinct microbial etiologies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An acute presentation of a frankly purulent urethral discharge is suggestive of gonorrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with dysuria alone are more likely to have chlamydial infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysuria that is accompanied by painful genital ulcers is most likely due to genital herpes simplex virus (HSV); patients with primary HSV infection may also complain of fever, tender local inguinal lymphadenopathy, and headache. </p><p/><p>Nevertheless, the syndromes of gonococcal and nongonococcal urethritis often overlap and cannot be reliably distinguished on clinical grounds only. Additionally, urethritis due to HSV can present without evident ulceration. (See <a href=\"#H350775\" class=\"local\">'Determining the microbial etiology'</a> below.)</p><p>A small minority of patients with urethritis, particularly due to <em>C. trachomatis</em>, may develop a reactive arthritis triad.

Many clinical sites may not have ready access to Gram staining or microscopy. In such settings, the presumptive diagnosis of urethritis can likewise be made based on the presence of symptoms, risk factors, or a positive leukocyte esterase on dipstick on first-voided urine. (See <a href=\"#H312870497\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below.)</p><p>Once urethritis is suspected or confirmed, additional testing to identify the involved pathogen(s), ideally with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), is warranted. (See <a href=\"#H350775\" class=\"local\">'Determining the microbial etiology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H350862\"><span class=\"h3\">Gram stain of urethral sample</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gram stains performed on male urethral swabs still play an important role in defining nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) and guiding empiric therapy as a point-of-care test, especially in public sexually transmitted infection clinics in the United States and in resource-poor settings worldwide. A specimen for Gram stain can be collected from expressed urethral discharge or from inside the urethra. A swab should be inserted gently at least 2 cm into the urethra and rotated 360 degrees, with care not to force the tip past an obstruction. The swab can then be rolled across a clean microscope slide for air drying and Gram stain evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-gram-stain-and-culture-results-in-the-microbiology-laboratory#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to Gram stain and culture results in the microbiology laboratory&quot;, section on 'Procedure'</a>.)</p><p>The Gram stain should be examined for the presence of WBCs (also specified as polymorphonuclear neutrophils [PMNs]) and any organisms. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lowered the threshold for urethritis diagnosis from 5 to 2 WBC per high power field (hpf), which is more sensitive for urethritis caused by <em>C. trachomatis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/1,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32,33</a>]. In a retrospective study that compared over 13,000 urethral Gram stain findings to NAAT results in men presenting with suspected urethritis, the rate of <em>C. trachomatis</em> positivity by NAAT increased with increasing number of WBC observed (5 percent for 0 <span class=\"nowrap\">WBC/hpf</span> to 44 percent for 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">WBC/hpf)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Using a threshold of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">WBC/hpf</span> would have missed 16 percent of men with <em>C. trachomatis</em>, whereas a threshold of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">WBC/hpf</span> misses only 7 percent. Of the men with <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, only 2 percent had &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">WBC/hpf</span>. Guidelines from other locations may use different diagnostic criteria. As an example, European guidelines continue to recommend a threshold of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">WBC/hpf</span> for the diagnosis of urethritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. </p><p>The presence of PMNs without any visible organisms is consistent with NGU (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56547\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56547 \">picture 1</a>), whereas gonococcal urethritis may be diagnosed by the demonstration of gram-negative intracellular or extracellular diplococci in the urethral exudate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50351\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50351 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p>Using a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentian-violet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentian violet</a></span> stain can also identify WBC and gonococcal forms on urethral swab specimens and can be performed more rapidly than the Gram stain. Results correlate with those of a Gram stain, although <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> appear as dark purple on the methylene <span class=\"nowrap\">blue/gentian</span> violet stain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H350870\"><span class=\"h3\">First-void urine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urethritis is suggested by a positive leukocyte esterase on dipstick or the presence of &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">WBC/hpf</span> on microscopy of first-void or first-catch urine. Inspection for WBCs can be performed by spinning 10 to 15 milliliters of urine and examining the sediment microscopically. This urine sample is also used for nucleic acid amplification testing for identification of the involved pathogen. (See <a href=\"#H350775\" class=\"local\">'Determining the microbial etiology'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal urine sample is the first-void urine, which refers to the initial portion of the first urinary stream after awakening, collected without pre-cleaning the urethral meatus. However, collection of the first-void urine at the point-of-care is impractical, so most practitioners request a first-catch urine, which refers to the initial portion of the urinary stream (generally the first 10 to 20 mL), collected without pre-cleaning the urethral meatus and ideally at least one hour after the previous micturition. Some small studies suggest that urine collected 20 minutes post-void has near-equivalent sensitivity for <em>C. trachomatis</em> by nucleic acid amplification testing as one hour post-void samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>The volume of urine collected appears to affect the microbial sensitivity. In one study, a device that allowed collection of 4 to 5 mL of first-catch urine yielded a specimen with a sixfold higher <em>C. trachomatis</em> organism load by NAAT compared with urine collected in a 50 mL cup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H312870497\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urethritis should be suspected in any sexually active man who presents with symptoms consistent with urethritis, in particular, dysuria, urethral pruritus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urethral discharge (see <a href=\"#H1458217\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above). In general, the diagnosis and treatment of urethritis should occur at the time of the presenting visit.

However, in situations where there is high suspicion for gonorrhea, we suggest that presumptive therapy for gonococcal urethritis be given rather than waiting for urine NAAT results.

These patients should be treated for urethritis with therapy that provides coverage for both gonococcal and chlamydial infections. If the presumptive diagnosis is made on the presence of urine leukocyte esterase or WBC alone, the possibility of urinary tract infection or prostatitis should also be considered, although this should not delay empiric therapy for urethritis among sexually active young men.

For men who are at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (ie, more than one partner, age &lt;25 years) <strong>and</strong> who are unlikely to return for follow-up, empiric treatment for gonococcal urethritis before availability of NAAT results is reasonable. Otherwise, treatment can be deferred and selected based on NAAT results. Among men without sexual risk factors, other causes of dysuria should be considered.

In the United States, both chlamydia and gonorrhea are reportable diseases, and a specific microbial diagnosis might facilitate treatment of the partner(s). Testing for other possible pathogens, including <em>T. vaginalis</em>, depends on the local availability of sensitive diagnostic tests and the suspicion for involvement of these additional organisms based on epidemiology or clinical findings.</p><p>NAAT of a first-catch urine is highly sensitive and specific and is the test of choice for identification of pathogens most commonly associated with urethritis. Urine based diagnostic testing also decreases costs and time to test completion and avoids the patient discomfort associated with urethral sampling, thereby potentially improving patient acceptance of diagnostic testing. Diagnostic testing for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em> are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection in adults and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections#H22688671\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of chlamydial infections'</a>.)</p><p>Because a urethral Gram stain that demonstrates intracellular diplococci is highly specific for gonococcal urethritis, a confirmatory NAAT for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> is not necessary in men if this finding is present. However, NAAT for <em>C. trachomatis</em> is still indicated because the two infections can coexist. When intracellular diplococci are not seen on Gram stain or if Gram stain is not performed, testing for both <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em> is indicated. </p><p>The identification of <em>T. vaginalis</em> in the setting of urethritis is somewhat difficult. NAAT performed on urine or urethral specimens for <em>T. vaginalis</em> is the optimal diagnostic test, as it is highly sensitive (74 to 100 percent, depending on the specimen and reference standard) and specific (97 to 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. If available, NAAT for <em>T. vaginalis</em> is useful when the local prevalence of the organism is high, among men with recurrent or persistent urethritis, and among sexual partners of women with trichomoniasis. However, NAAT is expensive, not FDA-approved in the United States for use on male urine, and may not be widely available, and other diagnostic tests for <em>T. vaginalis</em> are less useful in men. Although wet mount preparations for trichomonads can be useful in women, microscopy is very insensitive in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Endourethral culture and cultures of the first-void urine sediment also have low sensitivity in men. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>NAAT is the only accurate diagnostic test for <em>M. genitalium</em> infections, but is not widely accessible. In the United States, a PCR-based test is commercially available, but it has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Some laboratories have developed an internally validated NAAT for this purpose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women#H11966311\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma genitalium infection in men and women&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Culture, molecular, or serological testing for HSV and serological testing for syphilis is warranted in patients with symptoms of urethritis who also have genital ulcers on exam.

In such cases, NAAT for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, if performed, is negative despite the presence of intracellular diplococci on Gram stain.

Men with urethritis should be questioned about and evaluated for the presence of fever, testicular pain and swelling, obstructive urinary symptoms (dribbling or hesitancy), perineal or pelvic pain, which may suggest involvement of the epididymis or prostate. Gentle digital rectal exam is warranted in men who have symptoms suggestive of underlying prostatitis.

Patients should be questioned about oral or rectal sexual exposures and these sites should be tested if exposed. If available, NAAT is the test of choice at these sites. While NAAT for <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> have not been explicitly approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing of nongenital sites, many laboratories have met testing validation requirements for NAAT of such sites under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) regulations.

Clinical findings such as growth of uropathogens from urine culture or acute scrotal pain suggest these other processes. However, these conditions may also coexist with urethritis, so even if findings are consistent with one of these alternate diagnoses, the possibility of urethritis is not necessarily ruled out. These conditions are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

When microscopic evaluation of urethral specimens is not available, sexually active men with suspected urethritis should be empirically treated for gonococcal urethritis. The preferred regimen for gonococcal infections is a single intramuscular dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (250 mg) and a single oral dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (1 gram).

We prefer azithromycin since it can be given as a single, observed dose. Additionally, it is more effective against other potential causes of nongonococcal urethritis, such as <em>M. genitalium</em>, although cure rates for this pathogen are not optimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, if there are cost <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tolerance issues, doxycycline is an acceptable alternative.

In one of these trials, 606 men with NGU confirmed by evident urethral discharge on exam or consistent urethral specimen Gram stain findings were randomly assigned to the above doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> in addition to placebo for the other agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Among patients who returned for follow up (about 70 percent in each group), the overall clinical cure rates were similar with azithromycin and doxycycline-containing regimens (80 and 76 percent cured, respectively). However, the microbiologic cure rates following azithromycin or doxycycline therapy differed by pathogen (86 and 90 percent for <em>C. trachomatis</em>, 75 and 69 percent for <em>U. urealyticum</em>, and 40 and 30 percent for <em>M. genitalium</em>, respectively). In a separate trial of 305 men with NGU, azithromycin-based regimens were less effective than doxycycline-based regimens for microbiologic clearance of <em>C. trachomatis</em> (77 versus 95 percent cure), but more effective for <em>M. genitalium</em> (67 versus 31 percent cure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethritis-in-adult-men/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Involvement of other pathogens that are not routinely tested for can also affect cure rates.

They furthermore recommend using a five-day dosing regimen of azithromycin rather than the single oral dose if azithromycin is administered. These recommendations are based on evidence suggesting greater microbial efficacy of doxycycline compared with azithromycin for <em>C. trachomatis</em> and concern that the single dose azithromycin regimen could promote resistance in <em>M. genitalium</em>.

(See <a href=\"#H1457979\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysuria, or painful urination, is usually the chief complaint in men with urethritis. Other complaints include pruritus, burning, and discharge at the urethral meatus, which can be variable in presentation. An acute presentation with frankly purulent discharge suggests <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, the presence of dysuria alone suggests <em>C. trachomatis</em>, and the presence of painful genital ulcers suggests HSV. However, the syndromes of gonococcal and nongonococcal urethritis often overlap and cannot be reliably distinguished on clinical grounds only. (See <a href=\"#H1458217\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urethritis should be suspected in any sexually active man who presents with dysuria, urethral pruritus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urethral discharge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F102369\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102369 \">algorithm 1</a>). If point-of-care testing is available, the diagnosis of urethritis can be confirmed by the presence of one of the following findings: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mucopurulent or purulent discharge on examination </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&ge;2 white blood cells (WBC) per oil immersion field from the Gram stain (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentian-violet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentian violet</a></span> stain) of a urethral swab; the presence of intracellular diplococci confirms gonococcal urethritis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Positive leukocyte esterase (&quot;dipstick&quot;) or the presence of &ge;10 WBCs per high power field of the first-void or first-catch urine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If none of these findings are present or if point-of-care testing is not available, a presumptive or suspected diagnosis of urethritis can be made in sexually active men with suggestive symptoms. If urethritis is suspected or confirmed, testing for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em>, ideally with nucleic acid amplification testing, is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H1458293\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3479419\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, testing for other possible pathogens, such as <em>T. vaginalis</em> and HSV, depends on the local availability of diagnostic tests and the suspicion for involvement of these additional organisms based on epidemiology or clinical findings. Nucleic acid amplification tests performed on first-void urine are the most sensitive diagnostic tests for most sexually transmitted pathogens associated with urethritis. (See <a href=\"#H3479419\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other infectious diagnoses to consider among men presenting with dysuria include cystitis, epididymitis, and prostatitis. These conditions can also coexist with urethritis. Noninfectious etiologies that can lead to inflammation of the urethra include chemical irritation and repeated vigorous stripping of the urethra by the patient. (See <a href=\"#H1458429\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial antimicrobial treatment of urethritis is typically empiric at the point-of-care. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In men with symptoms of urethritis who have microscopic evidence of gonococcal urethritis (ie, gram-negative intracellular diplococci in the urethral exudate) or high clinical suspicion of gonococcal infection, treatment is as outlined for uncomplicated gonococcal infections. This regimen consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (250 mg intramuscularly once) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (1 gram orally once). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections#H278540\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of uncomplicated Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections&quot;, section on 'Preferred regimen for urogenital infection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with nongonococcal urethritis, when there is no microscopic, laboratory, or clinical evidence of <em>N. gonorrhea</em>, we suggest a single oral dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (1 gram) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> (100 mg orally twice daily for seven days) is also an effective alternate for <em>C. trachomatis</em> but is less effective against <em>M. genitalium</em>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the event that results of microbial diagnostic testing are available prior to the patient&rsquo;s receipt of an empiric regimen, antimicrobial treatment can be directed towards the identified pathogen(s). (See <a href=\"#H351041\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections#H77502526\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of uncomplicated Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections&quot;, section on 'Cephalosporins'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women#H11966325\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma genitalium infection in men and women&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent or persistent symptoms are common following therapy for urethritis. Possible causes include poor adherence to the regimen, reinfection, antimicrobial resistance (particularly in the case of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>), and involvement of other organisms inadequately treated by the empiric regimen (in particular, <em>M. genitalium</em>). (See <a href=\"#H273970\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent or persistent symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In order to decrease the risk of transmission, men with infectious urethritis should be instructed to refrain from sexual activity for at least seven days following the initiation of therapy. Men with documented <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> or <em>C. trachomatis </em>infections should undergo repeat testing three to six months after treatment to evaluate for reinfection. A test of cure at one to three weeks following therapy is not necessary for men with urethritis treated with first-line regimens for these pathogens, but is indicated when alternate regimens are used. Sexual contacts of patients diagnosed with urethritis warrant evaluation and treatment for sexually transmitted pathogens.
