Beryllium is an alkaline earth metal that is used in a number of different industrial applications. CBD shares many clinical and histopathological features with sarcoidosis and was first described in 1946 when 17 fluorescent lamp workers presented with a syndrome of advanced pulmonary granulomatous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis, sources of exposure, clinical and laboratory findings, diagnosis, and treatment of CBD will be reviewed here. The evaluation of the adult with interstitial lung disease and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of sarcoidosis are discussed separately.

Exposure to beryllium may occur among workers in the following industries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy beryllium-using industries: metal and metal alloy (beryllium-copper) machine shops, electronics, defense industry, and beryllium extraction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other beryllium-using industries: automotive, ceramic, computer, aerospace, metal reclamation, electronics and computer recycling, jewelry making, and dental <span class=\"nowrap\">alloy/appliance</span></p><p/><p>The exact exposure-response relationship for CBD is unclear. Both the dose and duration of beryllium exposure appear to be associated with an increased risk of sensitization and disease, with rates as high as 20 percent in certain higher exposure work tasks (eg, beryllium ceramics, machining, rod and wire production) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/8,10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10-14</a>]. However, the relationship does not appear to be linear, and the overall rate of CBD appears to be between 1 and 5 percent, according to cross-sectional studies of beryllium-using workplaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/8-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-21</a>]. </p><p>The current US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) industrial exposure limit for airborne beryllium is 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> time weighted average exposure for an eight hour day with a short term exposure limit of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> over a 15 minute sampling period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. While this revised OSHA standard should prevent a number of cases of CBD, it will likely not prevent all, as CBD still can occur at exposure levels lower than that currently proposed in the new OSHA standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. </p><p>The prior level of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> over eight hours was not protective against CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/7,9-12,14,17-19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-12,14,17-19,21</a>]. Some individuals develop clinically significant illness even at extremely low levels of exposure or after an exposure as short as three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Examples include those working in decontamination and decommission of old buildings in which beryllium had been used, construction trade workers, security guards, and secretaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/8,9,16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,16,20</a>]. It is estimated that between 134,000 and 800,000 current and former workers have been exposed to beryllium in the United States, although this number is likely an underestimate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The problem is not confined to the United States; cases of CBD have also been reported elsewhere in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Community acquired chronic beryllium disease has also been described in a small number of residents living within five miles of beryllium manufacturing facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a community survey of residents without occupational exposure to beryllium, disease manifestations sometimes developed 19 to 52 years after community-based exposure had ceased and were associated with substantial morbidity. Non-occupational cases of CBD have been described in family members of beryllium workers, through second-hand exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of CBD appears to involve a combination of an immunologic response to beryllium exposure and an underlying genetic susceptibility, although the reasons for persistence and progression of lung disease following cessation of exposure are less clear. Inhaled beryllium particles can be retained in the lungs and founded in increased numbers within CBD granulomas as much as nine years after cessation of beryllium exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with CBD and in beryllium-sensitized patients, beryllium elicits an immunologic reaction with characteristics of a cell-mediated or delayed hypersensitivity reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development#H1231136\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;, section on 'T cell development'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T helper subsets: Differentiation and role in disease&quot;, section on 'T helper subsets in disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>). These characteristics include beryllium-specific sensitization of T cells, proliferation of T cells upon reexposure, production and release of proinflammatory cytokines, and granulomatous inflammation. As the lungs are the typical portal of entry of beryllium, it is not surprising that the immune response is most strongly evident in the lungs.</p><p>Studies of peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from patients with CBD have shown that reexposure to beryllium in vitro typically induces a proliferative response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This proliferative response is specific for beryllium and is not induced by other metals. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test'</a> below.)</p><p>Similarly, studies of mononuclear cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from patients with CBD support the immunologic role of beryllium in the pathogenesis of CBD. The BAL cells were found to be relatively rich in CD4+ T cells that proliferated when cultured in vitro with beryllium salts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This T cell proliferative response could be abrogated with antibodies directed to major histocompatibility complex [MHC] II, but not MHC I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Genetic susceptibility'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage-in-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of bronchoalveolar lavage in diagnosis of interstitial lung disease&quot;, section on 'Constituents of BAL in ILD'</a>.)</p><p>Studies to identify the peptide(s) that bind to beryllium and facilitate recognition by T cells are in progress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These studies suggest that when beryllium is bound to proteins, such as ferritin and others, it can be taken up by antigen presenting cells. The resulting complex elicits a response from sensitized lymphocytes at concentrations five to six logs lower than the concentration of beryllium sulfate (BeSO<sup>4</sup>) typically required to induce proliferation. Enhanced antigenic potency of beryllium protein complexes provides a potential mechanism to explain how extremely low environmental levels of beryllium exposure in the workplace can induce sensitization and disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Lung mononuclear cell inflammation and granuloma formation are presumably maintained by the accumulation in the lung of large numbers of CD4+ memory T cells specific for either beryllium itself, beryllium associated with human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-DP or HLA-DR, or beryllium bound to an exogenous or endogenous peptide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Beryllium sensitization is predominantly a Th1 response involving interferon gamma and interleukin-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, cells collected by BAL from patients with CBD express increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. These cytokines (in conjunction with T cell cytokines) are thought to be important in the initiation and maintenance of the human granulomatous response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>Several hypotheses have been developed to explain why CBD persists and progresses after removal from exposure to beryllium. One possibility is that the metal antigen is retained in the lung due to the solubility of beryllium and its ability to cause macrophages to undergo apoptosis and re-release previously phagocytosed beryllium particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/29,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,41</a>]. Another potential explanation for the persistence of the immune response comes from the identification of a deficient and dysfunctional population of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the BAL fluid obtained from patients with CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The impaired functional capacity of the Treg cells may decrease the suppression of CD4+ T cell proliferation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T helper subsets: Differentiation and role in disease&quot;, section on 'Modulation by regulatory T cells'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;, section on 'Suppression'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HLA disease associations and susceptibility to abnormal immune reactions are believed to reflect changes in the HLA molecule hypervariable regions critical to antigen presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In this regard, the HLA-DPbeta1 (HLA-DPB1) gene comprises six hypervariable coding regions. Eighty-five percent of patients with CBD (compared to 40 to 45 percent of controls) have an HLA-DPB1 variant, which contains a glutamate for lysine substitution at position 69 at one of the hypervariable regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/23,44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,44-48</a>]. This variant along with other amino acid changes in the antigen binding pocket results in a markedly increased risk of CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. More recently, HLA-DRB1 variants with similar negatively charged amino acids (glutamate at position 71) in the antigen binding pocket have been shown to be associated with CBD risk, particularly in those individuals who do not have the HLA-DP DPB1 glutamate 69 variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;, section on 'Class II region'</a>.)</p><p>At present, these genotypes are markers for susceptibility to beryllium sensitivity and CBD among exposed individuals. However, they are not appropriate screening tools given the relatively high prevalence of these genotypes in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/44,45,47,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45,47,50,51</a>]. Similarly, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha polymorphisms have been associated with beryllium-induced expression of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein by CBD patients' blood and bronchoalveolar lavage cells, but not with CBD or risk of beryllium sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. Additional genetic factors are likely involved in the risk of beryllium sensitization, progression to CBD, and more severe disease, although these are unclear at this time. Studies of gene by environment interactions demonstrate that both beryllium exposure and HLA-DPB1 genotype contribute to the odds of developing beryllium sensitization and CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/24,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of CBD are nonspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Common symptoms include dry cough, shortness of breath, fever, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/9,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,42</a>]. Bronchial involvement can produce symptoms similar to those of asthma. The latency period between initial beryllium exposure and onset of symptoms varies from three months to 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Cutaneous nodules can develop, especially if beryllium has penetrated the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81104\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81104 \">picture 1</a>). These nodules tend to be located on exposed areas of skin, such as fingers and forearms and are generally smaller than the cutaneous nodules seen in sarcoidosis. Pulmonary examination typically reveals bibasilar crackles; more advanced disease may be associated with signs of cor pulmonale and digital clubbing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H621415692\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of patients with suspected CBD includes identifying beryllium sensitization of peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar cells with beryllium lymphocyte proliferation testing, assessing the severity of disease with pulmonary function testing, determining whether the pattern seen on chest imaging is compatible with CBD, and confirming the diagnosis with histopathologic analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271805197\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of routine laboratory tests are typically nonspecific. Measurement of the serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level is not helpful, as it does not discriminate between patients with CBD, beryllium sensitization, beryllium exposure, or sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Among 23 patients with CBD, only 22 percent had an elevated serum ACE level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Early in the course of CBD, the pulmonary function abnormalities, if present at all, include mild airflow limitation and abnormal gas exchange at rest or during exercise (manifested as worsening hypoxemia with increasing exercise). Diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is commonly diminished, although this test is less sensitive than arterial blood gas analysis at rest and exercise. As the disease becomes more clinically apparent, spirometry shows airflow limitation, restriction, or a mixed pattern. Pure restriction is a relatively late finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

As an example, it is estimated that up to 6 percent of all patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis may actually have CBD, although the exact proportion depends on the clinic's referral population and the degree of clinical suspicion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Note that even seemingly minor, historically-remote exposures to beryllium or its alloys can be significant (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Exposure'</a> above). When histopathology is unavailable, the diagnosis can be made based on the history of exposure, a positive BeLPT, and imaging that shows abnormalities consistent with CBD. As a general approach to diagnosis, all patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of lung disease or an occupational or environmental history of beryllium exposure should be evaluated for CBD.

Repeated testing with the BeLPT is used to detect workers who may develop sensitization or CBD over time and is recommended for monitoring of those with ongoing exposure. The BeLPT is also used to correct misdiagnoses of sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In the BeLPT assay, mononuclear cells from peripheral blood or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are exposed in vitro to three different concentrations of beryllium salts (eg, beryllium sulfate) for two different time intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Cell proliferation is measured by the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into the DNA of dividing cells. The cutoff value for a positive test is laboratory-dependent. If none of the six resultant tests show increased lymphocyte proliferation, the test is normal. If one of the six incubations shows increased uptake, the test is borderline. If two or more of the incubations show increased uptake the test is abnormal. The specificity of in vitro generated beryllium-reactive cells can be demonstrated by the lack of response to other metals and by the normal stimulation index of those exposed to beryllium without evidence of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/34,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,64,65</a>].</p><p>The sensitivity of a single peripheral blood BeLPT is 0.683 and the specificity 0.96 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. To improve the sensitivity of the testing and to resolve borderline test results, all negative and borderline tests are generally repeated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. If the second test is either positive or borderline, the patient is considered to be sensitized to beryllium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Among patients with a positive blood BeLPT, 20 to 100 percent will have evidence of CBD based on BAL or transbronchial biopsy results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/7,12,14,15,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,14,15,67</a>]. This wide range is likely related to variations in the magnitude of beryllium exposure in the workplace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p>On the other hand, if both rounds of BeLPT testing are negative, the patient may still have CBD, as the probability of having two false negative results is estimated to be between 7 and 10 percent. Thus, for an individual with clinical evidence of lung disease and a history of exposure to beryllium, even at very low levels, further testing for CBD (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage, tissue biopsy) would be indicated even if the blood BeLPT is negative. &#160;</p><p>If BeLPT testing is not available locally, blood and BAL samples are sent to a reference laboratory (eg, <a href=\"https://www.nationaljewish.org/for-professionals/diagnostic-testing/adx/tests/beryllium-lymphocyte-stimulation,-blood&amp;token=+gFY7cw0AHvQNfYVj13Tb/aGOH+zo7yEdvq04V9Mh9KCrMm34jUzclshQsazynnbduYlSGixru2AU8dmd4JqBCe9Hi6RxNZn0w9DIpNapZaicFqlg+a3hzVZ8t0QbqqQVa6UI7Zpdu5iVXRVKvYzhA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4367\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Jewish Health</a>) or <a href=\"https://orise.orau.gov/worker-health/beryllium/testing-laboratory.html&amp;token=YeaCL2fypkWJrAR6tA+IKLNOCxRh1K2jrU3JqvgOeeAGLE4YbKlyR9g4IVA+uoQbPcVPNWeSwl+aYO+OsxldwVJsOxEb0w79CuAOFY/WTEc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4367\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ORISE Beryllium Testing Laboratory</a>.</p><p>Experimental variations on the BeLPT have been developed in an effort to improve detection of lymphocyte proliferation.

A separate investigational approach monitors in vitro macrophage production of neopterin following beryllium stimulation, as an indicator of beryllium-induced TNF-alpha and gamma interferon activation. Although this modification of the blood BeLPT may eventually help differentiate beryllium sensitization from CBD, it requires further investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Another experimental approach to distinguishing between beryllium sensitization and CBD without invasive procedures, called a beryllium ELISPOT test, assesses the number of beryllium-specific CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood. Patients with CBD tend to have higher numbers of these circulating beryllium-specific T cells than subjects with sensitization alone; however, the accuracy and predictive value of the beryllium ELISPOT test remain under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6629538\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchoalveolar lavage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have a positive peripheral blood BeLPT or a clear history of exposure to beryllium, we perform bronchoscopy with a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to obtain cell counts and a sample of BAL mononuclear cells for BeLPT testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A portion of the BAL fluid is also sent for cytology and cultures (eg, actinomycosis, nocardia, mycobacterial, fungal). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage-in-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of bronchoalveolar lavage in diagnosis of interstitial lung disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of bronchoalveolar lavage&quot;, section on 'Processing the lavage specimen'</a>.)</p><p>The technique for obtaining BAL fluid for BeLPT testing differs from the usual BAL technique due to the requirement for a large number of cells. The exact specifications for preparation and transportation of the BAL cells for BeLPT may vary between laboratories and should be confirmed with the laboratory prior to performing the BAL. During bronchoscopy, we perform the BAL prior to any biopsy procedures to avoid contamination of the fluid with blood from a biopsy. After wedging the bronchoscope in an area of lung believed to have active disease based on the high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), we typically do four successive 60 mL saline lavages to a total instilled volume of 240 mL. If the lung is diffusely involved, we perform the BAL in either the lingula or right middle lobe. If the return from the lavage is less than 50 percent, an additional lavage may be performed in a separate site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of bronchoalveolar lavage&quot;, section on 'Technique'</a>.) </p><p>After samples for other studies have been set aside, the BAL fluid is centrifuged at approximately 1200 RPM for 10 minutes. The supernatant is discarded and the cells are resuspended in a plastic centrifuge tube with a mixture of RPMI 1640 (or similar tissue culture medium), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> sulfate or <span class=\"nowrap\">penicillin/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a></span> (0.5 percent by volume), and pooled AB positive serum or the patient's own serum at 10 percent by volume. The final concentration of cells in the media should be approximately 5 to 10 million cells per mL. The sample is kept at room temperature and transported immediately to the laboratory performing the BeLPT test, which must be notified prior to obtaining and sending the specimen. </p><p>Approximately 10 to 35 percent of patients with beryllium sensitivity have a negative BeLPT test on peripheral blood, but a positive test on BAL mononuclear cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. One explanation for this observation is that cells obtained from BAL generally yield higher peak stimulation responses to beryllium salts than cells from peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. However, occasionally BAL proliferation assays give false negative results due to a significant excess of alveolar macrophages in the lavage, which is a common finding among cigarette smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Processing BAL fluid for BeLPT is more complicated than processing peripheral blood, and is not available in most medical centers.

Endobronchial biopsies are useful because noncaseating granulomas have been identified in the bronchial wall in approximately thirty percent of patients with CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Four to six endobronchial biopsies are typically obtained from a site where the mucosa appears erythematous; if the mucosa appears normal throughout, endobronchial biopsies are obtained from the main carina and a secondary carina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

The typical pathologic findings of CBD are noncaseating granulomas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mononuclear cell infiltrates in the bronchial wall or lung interstitium. In some patients, the same pathology can be detected in the regional lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/76,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,79</a>]. Biopsies of beryllium-induced skin nodules also typically demonstrate noncaseating granulomas. While it is possible to measure beryllium inside granulomas using mineral analytic methods that can demonstrate increased levels of beryllium within granulomas, this testing is not commonly used to diagnose CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Among patients with clinical evidence of CBD based on exposure history and pulmonary function testing or high resolution computed tomography, approximately 5 to 10 percent have false-negative biopsies and require either repeat bronchoscopy or video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy. False negative results should be suspected if the lavage lymphocyte percentage is elevated (eg, &gt;20 percent in nonsmokers) and the beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT) is positive on either the blood or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>When the BeLPT on BAL lymphocytes is positive, but transbronchial biopsies are inadequate or cannot be obtained, BAL lymphocytosis may be used as a surrogate marker for underlying pathology.

However, BAL lymphocytosis is not specific for CBD, unless the BeLPT is performed using the BAL cells. For patients with BAL lymphocytosis and a negative BAL BeLPT, further evaluation for other causes of BAL lymphocytosis is needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69908 \">table 2</a>).

If no improvement in symptoms or physiologic parameters has occurred after six months, a decision is made whether to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy or add another immunosuppressive agent. If there has been a lag time of several years between the onset of symptoms and initiation of therapy or if the chest radiograph and HRCT suggest a greater proportion of fibrotic change, the patient likely does not have reversible disease and glucocorticoid therapy can be tapered and stopped.

However, only one small clinical trial has been conducted. Similar to the findings in sarcoidosis, this trial suggests that those with more severe disease may experience improvement in quality of life and potentially also lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

Among 348 untreated patients with CBD, 28 percent died, although the number of years between disease onset and death was not recorded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Other published mortality rates range from 6 to 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/81,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,88</a>]. The variability appears to depend on the industrial setting, the duration of beryllium exposure after development of CBD, individual variation, and the duration of clinical follow up. As an example, beryllium extraction workers appear to have a lower mortality rate than those working with beryllium alloys or ceramics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The reason for this observation is not known.</p><p>Among patients with beryllium sensitization without CBD (ie, a positive blood beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test [BeLPT], but no lung pathology), the risk of progressing to CBD is clearly increased, compared with non-sensitized workers. The magnitude of risk was evaluated in a longitudinal study of 55 sensitized individuals, 17 of whom (31 percent) developed CBD within a median follow-up of 3.8 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In a separate surveillance study, progression from beryllium sensitization to CBD occurred in 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>Whether the disease will be mild or fulminant is not predicted by the duration of exposure or the degree of positivity of the peripheral blood BeLPT. However, the type or intensity of exposure may influence progression as suggested by a surveillance study that found a higher rate of disease progression among machinists than non-machinists based on pulmonary function and gas exchange testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In addition, a higher percentage of lymphocytes in the BAL correlates with a greater severity of the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Tobacco use does not seem to predict a worsened clinical course, and in some studies smokers with beryllium sensitization of peripheral blood lymphocytes were less likely to have CBD at the time of bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/9,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,76</a>]. </p><p>For patients with CBD who receive treatment with glucocorticoids, stabilization or improvement in symptoms and pulmonary function is likely, as long as glucocorticoid therapy is maintained. However, some patients experience progressive deterioration in lung function and development of pulmonary fibrosis, despite cessation of beryllium exposure and maintenance glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/42,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,82</a>]. </p><p>Beryllium has been suspected of increasing the risk of lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]; however, studies with careful adjustment for the risk attributable to cigarette smoking have not supported a significant increase in risk due to beryllium exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/92-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">92-95</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271806542\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The previous permissible limit for occupational exposure (PEL) to beryllium that was designed to prevent CBD was 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup>,</span> as an eight hour time weighted average. However, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has published a 10-fold lower PEL of 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> with a short term exposure limit of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> over a 15 minute sampling period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. As noted above, this new OSHA standard is likely to prevent some, but not prevent all cases of CBD, as CBD still can occur at exposure levels lower than the proposed new OSHA standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Exposure'</a> above.)</p><p>The lines of evidence to support a new, lower permissible exposure limit are thoroughly described in the 2017 OSHA Final Rule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. As an example, in a study of workers in a beryllium machining facility, workers who developed beryllium hypersensitivity or CBD were exposed to beryllium concentrations in the ambient air above 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> (95th percentile) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Among workers at the facility who developed CBD, 90 percent were exposed to concentrations greater than 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> within a given year of their work history. Based on this analysis, it was suggested that maintaining exposure levels below 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/m<sup>3</sup></span> for 95 percent of the time might prevent beryllium sensitization and CBD. Further work is needed to determine a level of exposure to beryllium that is safe for all workers, including those with a greater susceptibility or genetic predisposition, as they appear to develop disease at a level lower than others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/24,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,48</a>]. </p><p>In the meantime, there are also a number of ways to minimize occupational exposure to beryllium. These include having companies use safer metals, improving ventilation systems to reduce dust, administrative controls such as minimizing the number of workers allowed into beryllium areas, providing personal protective equipment (eg, respirators) when exposures cannot be adequately controlled, and educating workers in how to reduce the risk of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Dermal exposure can also contribute to risk of beryllium sensitization; therefore, measures should be taken to protect skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. Use of the beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT) in the workplace can potentially identify areas associated with a greater risk for CBD or sensitization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271806246\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic beryllium disease (CBD), also called berylliosis, is caused by exposure to respirable beryllium metal or alloys and is characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in the lungs. CBD shares many clinical and histopathological features with pulmonary sarcoidosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beryllium exposure occurs in various industries, including beryllium and beryllium alloy (beryllium-copper) machining, the aerospace, automotive, ceramics, computer, defense, and electronic industries. Community acquired chronic beryllium disease has also been described. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Exposure'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CBD requires all three of the following findings: a history of beryllium exposure, a positive beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT), and the presence of noncaseating granulomas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mononuclear cell interstitial cell infiltrates on lung biopsy. However, if biopsies are not available or are nondiagnostic, the diagnosis can be made based on the history of exposure, a positive BeLPT, and imaging that shows abnormalities consistent with CBD. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with a history of beryllium exposure, the diagnosis of CBD should be suspected in the presence of dyspnea, cough, or a chest radiograph showing hilar adenopathy or reticular and nodular lung opacities. A high resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scan is usually obtained to characterize the radiographic pattern and to identify the areas of greatest involvement for bronchoalveolar lavage or potential biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Chest imaging studies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of berylliosis includes sarcoidosis, other granulomatous lung diseases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and asthma. (See <a href=\"#H271805890\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood BeLPT is the initial diagnostic test of choice for patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of lung disease and an occupational or environmental history of beryllium exposure. This test can also be used periodically to screen exposed workers for CBD. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a positive blood BeLPT or a strong clinical suspicion for CBD despite a negative blood BeLPT, the next test is usually fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endobronchial biopsy, and transbronchial biopsy. To obtain an adequate number of cells for BeLPT, a BAL volume of at least 240 mL of saline (in 4 aliquots) and up to 480 mL, is used. BAL fluid is also sent for cell and differential counts and also microbiologic and cytologic analyses. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who meet criteria for beryllium sensitization, but not CBD, we advise cessation of exposure to beryllium, due to the high rate of developing CBD if exposure continues. (See <a href=\"#H6629594\" class=\"local\">'Supportive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients who meet criteria for CBD, we recommend cessation of exposure to beryllium (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For those who have minimal to no symptoms and mild or no impairment in physiologic testing, we reassess symptoms and lung physiologic testing at periodic intervals and initiate therapy in the event of disease progression. (See <a href=\"#H6629594\" class=\"local\">'Supportive therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H271806535\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with bothersome cough or dyspnea, initial values for forced vital capacity, total lung capacity, or diffusing capacity that are below 70 percent of predicted, or a decline of greater than 10 percent during an observation period, we recommend treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Typically, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is initiated at a dose of 0.5 to 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (approximately 40 mg) per day. Tapering of prednisone is guided by the clinical response. Usually after six to eight weeks, prednisone is tapered to 20 mg daily (or 40 mg on alternate days) and after several months to 5 to 10 mg daily (or 10 to 20 mg on alternate days). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who fail to respond to glucocorticoids or experience severe side effects from glucocorticoids, other immunosuppressive agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>) may be tried, although clinical trials supporting this practice have not been published.
