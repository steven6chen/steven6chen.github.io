A systematic approach is necessary to reach a correct diagnosis and to identify serious underlying etiologies. The patient&rsquo;s age, underlying disease conditions, visual history, and history of possible injury must be determined. The extent of the visual impairment, the rapidity of its onset, and the association with other systemic findings are vital pieces of information. </p><p>This topic will review the causes of vision change (eg, diplopia, blurry vision). The approach to a child with vision loss is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute vision loss in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23489632\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF DIPLOPIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a child complains of diplopia, a prompt evaluation should be initiated. Younger children may not be able to complain of diplopia. Instead, they may squint, cover one eye with their hand, or tilt their head to one side. Diplopia may be binocular or monocular (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diplopia#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diplopia&quot;, section on 'Diplopia'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Binocular diplopia is present with both eyes open and absent when either eye is closed. Binocular diplopia reflects conditions in which the visual axes are misaligned. In general, most patients will close the eye with the dysfunctional muscle unless that is the eye with the much better vision. Binocular diplopia will be discussed here.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monocular diplopia is present if the diplopia occurs when either eye is closed. This condition is very rare in children and is typically caused by local eye disease or refractive error.</p><p/><p>The orbital muscles are innervated by cranial nerve III except for the superior oblique (cranial nerve IV) and the lateral rectus (cranial nerve VI) muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62010\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62010 \">figure 1</a>). Any condition that results in palsy of the third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerves can cause binocular diplopia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-pediatric-patient-with-vision-change/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Other potential etiologies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions associated with transient loss of supraoptic control of eye movements (eg, ocular migraine, seizures, drug intoxication [eg, ethanol, benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotic medications])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mass lesions of the orbit (eg, orbital tumors, hematoma, or infection)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular muscle weakness or malfunction (eg, myasthenia gravis, tick paralysis, botulism, orbital floor fracture with entrapment) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21270644\"><span class=\"h2\">Third cranial nerve palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Third nerve palsy in children often is congenital (intrauterine or birth-related events) but may occur after postnatal trauma, infection, inflammation, tumor, or childhood migraine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71965\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71965 \">table 1</a>).

Children with congenital third nerve palsies may not complain of diplopia because they ignore or suppress the second image or because they have superimposed amblyopia; often they are brought to medical attention by their parents, who have noticed ptosis or strabismus. Patients with third nerve palsy may have one or more of the following findings (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ptosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59305\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59305 \">picture 1</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary position exotropia (eye turned out) which worsens with gaze toward the paretic medial rectus muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55347\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55347 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ipsilateral hypertropia (eye is turned up)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete third nerve palsies usually are associated with a large-angle exotropia and hypotropia (eye is down and out)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21270681\"><span class=\"h2\">Fourth cranial nerve palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of fourth nerve palsies in children are congenital, traumatic, and idiopathic.

Objects viewed in primary position or especially in down-gaze may appear double (eg, when going down a flight of stairs so that the child does not know which step to select). </p><p>On examination, an ipsilateral hypertropia (the involved eye is deviated upward) is present because the action of the superior oblique muscle (to move the eye down and in) is weak. The deviation is greater when gaze is in the direction toward the weak muscle. Thus, a right fourth nerve palsy causes greater hypertropia in left gaze. The deviation is greater in ipsilateral head tilt. The patient may adopt an anomalous head position to avoid diplopia because torsional and vertical diplopia often improve with head tilting to the side opposite the paralyzed muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63202 \">picture 2</a>).

The lesions may be congenital or acquired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80526\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80526 \">table 3</a>).

However, children may not complain of diplopia. Early in the course, strabismus may be present only in the gaze toward the paralyzed side, but with time, the strabismus (ie, esotropia) may be present when gazing straight ahead (in primary position). The degree of esotropia and abduction deficit are markers of severity of the paresis or palsy. </p><p>The ocular examination typically reveals a primary position esotropia (eye turned in), worse in gaze toward the paretic muscle (lateral incomitance), and an ipsilateral abduction deficit. The face often is turned toward the paralyzed side to avoid the gaze toward the symptomatic lateral rectus muscle. Other manifestations depend upon the location of the lesion along the course of the nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55159\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55159 \">table 4</a>).

Ophthalmoplegic migraine, which occurs primarily in children, affects the third cranial nerve causing ptosis, pupillary dilation, diplopia, and blurred vision. It can take days to weeks to resolve. Basilar migraine are typically occipital, associated with visual disturbances and accompanied by blurred or tunnel vision, dizziness, ataxia, diplopia, and vomiting. Headache and nausea after such an episode are the rule, but occasionally may be absent.

The clinical manifestations vary from subtle blurring of vision to severe diplopia. Weakness of the eye muscles in MG can also produce ptosis, the degree of which is variable, switching from one eye to the other on separate examinations and occasionally increasing with sudden exposure to bright light. Most patients with MG do not complain of eye pain or headache. Fatigability and variability of clinical findings are characteristic.</p><p>Physical examination may reveal unusual eye movements that do not conform to the anatomy of one nerve or muscle. The pupils are always spared in MG, helping in the differentiation from other disorders, such as botulism. The diagnosis and treatment of myasthenia gravis is discussed separately.

The tick species that cause most cases of human tick paralysis in the United States and Canada are Dermacentor andersonii (the Rocky Mountain wood tick), and D. variabilis (the American dog tick). Tick paralysis occurs four to seven days after a female tick has been feeding on the human host. Paralysis may involve the ocular muscles causing diplopia. It is typically associated with paresthesias, fatigue, and muscle weakness, which progresses to unsteady gait and ascending complete paralysis. However, unilateral and isolated paralysis has also been described.

Conjunctivitis in children is most commonly infectious. Etiologies commonly include non-typable Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and adenovirus. Onset is variable, but usually occurs over one or two days, and vision is not greatly impaired. Infectious conjunctivitis may be associated with corneal abrasions due to eye rubbing. Conjunctivitis must also be differentiated from infectious keratitis (inflammation of the cornea).

Some patients may not be able to recall a specific event. A younger child may just start crying and holding the eye. Contact lens wearers are at increased risk for developing infectious keratitis. Corneal abrasions may be caused by superficial ocular foreign bodies that are trapped under the eyelids, particularly the upper lid, and cause injury during blinking.
