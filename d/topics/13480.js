Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs in response to multiple abnormalities that initially stem from decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients is discussed at length elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD)&quot;, section on 'Overview'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with mild disease, secondary hyperparathyroidism resolves after renal transplantation, as a more normal GFR is restored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. However, persistent hyperparathyroidism is reported to occur in approximately 15 to 50 percent of patients following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/4,5,9-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,9-19</a>]. This is because of the persistence of structural changes in the parathyroid, such as hyperplasia and adenoma formation, despite removal of the initial stimuli for hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/4,5,9,10,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,9,10,20-23</a>].</p><p>Because of the normal or near-normal GFR among transplant recipients, the clinical manifestations of persistent hyperparathyroidism in the transplant recipient differ from those associated with hyperparathyroidism in nontransplant CKD patients. In the transplant recipient, the clinical manifestations resemble primary hyperparathyroidism and are characterized by hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H635254359\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.) By contrast, nontransplant CKD patients with hyperparathyroidism typically have hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD)&quot;, section on 'Disorders of calcium balance'</a>.)</p><p>Factors additional to hyperparathyroidism contribute to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia in transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Increased calcitriol production and resorption of soft-tissue calcium phosphate deposition can cause hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/4,15,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15,24</a>]. Some patients have an increase in total plasma calcium because of an increase in the plasma albumin concentration (which is often due to better nutrition after transplantation). However, the increase in total calcium due to an increase in albumin is generally mild and of no clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Increased serum albumin raises the total plasma calcium concentration by increasing the albumin-bound fraction but has no effect on the physiologically important free or ionized calcium concentration. High-dose glucocorticoids may mask hypercalcemia due to effects to limit gastrointestinal calcium absorption, with hypercalcemia manifesting during tapering of the glucocorticoid dose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=relation-between-total-and-ionized-serum-calcium-concentrations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypophosphatemia after transplantation is caused by both persistent hyperparathyroidism and excess FGF-23 production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/16,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,25-28</a>]. FGF-23 is secreted by bone osteocytes and osteoblasts in response to calcitriol, increased dietary phosphate load, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. Patients with CKD have increased FGF-23 concentrations due to decreased phosphate clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Markedly elevated FGF-23 levels before renal transplantation may persist after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], but more commonly FGF-23 concentrations decline rapidly following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The relative contribution of excess PTH and FGF-23 to phosphate wasting after transplantation depends on the timing of onset after transplantation. Both hyperparathyroidism and hyperphosphatonism may contribute to phosphate wasting during the early posttransplant period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. Persistent hyperparathyroidism, but not increased FGF-23, likely causes phosphate wasting that persists beyond one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors may contribute to hypophosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], though not all studies have shown this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Higher doses of glucocorticoids have been associated with higher levels of FGF-23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H635254359\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary manifestations of persistent hyperparathyroidism after transplantation include hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/8,13,14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,14,19</a>].

The optimal treatment of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those on dialysis, is discussed elsewhere.

The approach to nontransplant candidates with refractory hyperparathyroidism is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Refractory hyperparathyroidism and indications for parathyroidectomy in dialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Potential indications for parathyroidectomy'</a>.)</p><p>There is variability among transplant centers in the recommended approach for transplant candidates who have refractory hyperparathyroidism prior to transplantation. Almost all experts suggest parathyroidectomy for transplant candidates who have refractory hyperparathyroidism and moderate to severe symptoms, particularly if transplantation is not imminent. This approach is the same as the approach for nontransplant ESRD patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Refractory hyperparathyroidism and indications for parathyroidectomy in dialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic patients'</a>.)</p><p>Transplant nephrologists have differing recommendations for transplant candidates who have only mild or no symptoms. Prior to transplantation, independent of the absence or presence of symptoms, we generally refer for subtotal parathyroidectomy all transplant candidates who have an intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) &ge;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> despite medical therapy. PTH concentrations &gt;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> have been associated with a &gt;80 percent risk of graft failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Intact PTH values above this threshold are unlikely to respond to vitamin D or active vitamin D derivatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/20,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,46</a>]. In addition, as noted above, severe hyperparathyroidism is associated with delayed graft function, <span class=\"nowrap\">hypercalcemia/hypercalciuria,</span> hypophosphatemia, and decreased patient and allograft survival after transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H635254359\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H635254561\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p>However, some transplant nephrologists do not perform subtotal parathyroidectomy prior to transplantation among asymptomatic patients, since, as noted above, hyperparathyroidism resolves in many, though not all, patients after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/7,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,47,48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H635254353\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Parathyroidectomy may be safer if performed prior to transplantation.

(See <a href=\"#H998153134\" class=\"local\">'After transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p>For potential recipients of deceased-donor kidneys, but not living-donor kidneys, the decision regarding parathyroidectomy may depend on the anticipated time on the waiting list, which will vary based upon the geographic region. The indications for parathyroidectomy for patients who are expected to have a prolonged wait on the deceased-donor waiting list are the same as for patients who are not awaiting transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Refractory hyperparathyroidism and indications for parathyroidectomy in dialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic patients'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients#H267003420\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Refractory hyperparathyroidism and indications for parathyroidectomy in dialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Asymptomatic patients'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cinacalcet</a> is commonly used among nontransplant-candidate ESRD patients who have refractory hyperparathyroidism. However, we generally do not use cinacalcet in transplant candidates, unless parathyroidectomy is contraindicated. The use of cinacalcet prior to renal transplantation has been associated with rebound hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia when cinacalcet is discontinued at the time of transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].</p><p>Patients who are being treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> should have cinacalcet stopped prior to transplantation, at least temporarily, in order to assess the severity of hyperparathyroidism off cinacalcet. This approach may identify patients who might benefit from pretransplant parathyroidectomy and minimize the number of cinacalcet-treated patients who have rebound hypercalcemia posttransplantation.

Other clinicians, however, do not use cinacalcet in any transplant recipients and refer all patients who have hyperparathyroidism and persistent hypercalcemia for parathyroidectomy, although this approach may lead to surgical treatment of hyperparathyroidism that may resolve with long follow-up. In some posttransplant clinical trials, for example, cinacalcet corrected elevated serum calcium levels and did not adversely affect kidney function in the short term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/55-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-61</a>].</p><p>The interaction between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> and immunosuppressive therapy has been evaluated in 14 renal transplant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

It has been associated with increased mortality and decreased allograft survival. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H635254353\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H635254561\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary manifestations of persistent hyperparathyroidism include hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Symptoms observed in nontransplant chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients such as bone pain, pruritus, and myopathy are rare. (See <a href=\"#H635254359\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all transplant recipients, we monitor serum calcium, phosphorus at each visit during the first year and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase quarterly. Thereafter, PTH and alkaline phosphatase can be monitored annually. (See <a href=\"#H24881652\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring after transplant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate treatment of hyperparathyroidism prior to transplantation is generally the safest approach to prevention of persistent hyperparathyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H998152965\" class=\"local\">'Before transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that all transplant candidates who have an intact PTH &ge;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> despite medical therapy be referred for parathyroidectomy prior to transplantation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). PTH values above this value have been associated with increased graft failure and are unlikely to respond to vitamin D or active vitamin D derivatives. Some transplant nephrologists do not perform parathyroidectomy prior to transplantation among asymptomatic patients, since, as noted above, hyperparathyroidism resolves in many, though not all, patients after transplantation. We generally do not use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> in transplant candidates, unless parathyroidectomy is contraindicated. (See <a href=\"#H998152965\" class=\"local\">'Before transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After transplantation, hypercalcemia from any cause is treated by ensuring adequate fluid intake and avoiding drugs that can cause hypercalcemia. Patients with hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia despite these measures may be treated with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> or subtotal parathyroidectomy. The optimal approach is not known and often varies between transplant centers. (See <a href=\"#H893094414\" class=\"local\">'Hypercalcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal approach to hypophosphatemia is not known. The treatment of mild or moderate hypophosphatemia (defined as 1 to 2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> depends on the PTH level. Among patients who have an increased PTH concentration (ie, approximately two to three times the upper limit of normal), we first treat the hyperparathyroidism. If hypophosphatemia persists following successful treatment of high PTH, we increase the intake of phosphate-rich foods. Among patients with severe hypophosphatemia (&lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> most clinicians give oral phosphate supplements regardless of the PTH or calcium concentration. Vitamin D derivatives can also be used to raise phosphorus in this setting if patients are not hypercalcemic. Patients with severe hypophosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism may be referred for parathyroidectomy. (See <a href=\"#H893094013\" class=\"local\">'Increased parathyroid hormone without hypercalcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We treat all patients with isolated elevations of PTH concentration. The optimal treatment is not known and varies between centers. Our approach is based upon experience and expert opinion and not randomized trials of transplant recipients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We follow a stepwise approach that includes vitamin D and vitamin D derivatives, such as calcitriol. A subtotal parathyroidectomy or addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> is not indicated to treat elevated PTH in the absence of hypercalcemia.
