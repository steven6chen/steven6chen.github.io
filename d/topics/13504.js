The event is referred to as SCA (or aborted SCD) if an intervention (eg, defibrillation) or spontaneous reversion restores circulation, while the SCD terminology is employed if the patient dies. However, the use of SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest often persists by convention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of SCA consists of acute resuscitation using standardized advanced cardiac life-support protocols, followed by therapy to prevent recurrent arrhythmias and SCD. Patients who survive SCA caused by <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> not due to a reversible cause generally receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Antiarrhythmic drugs are used in select patients as adjunctive therapy, or as primary therapy when an ICD is not indicated or refused by the patient. This approach, endorsed by numerous professional societies, is based on the significant survival benefit of patients receiving an ICD compared with antiarrhythmic drugs alone or no therapy.</p><p>This topic will review the role of pharmacologic therapy in survivors of SCA, with an emphasis on the role of antiarrhythmic drugs. Issues related to the acute management of SCA, the evaluation of survivors, and the utility of an ICD, arrhythmic surgery, or radiofrequency ablation are discussed separately.

Because an ICD treats, but does not prevent, arrhythmias, patients who have arrhythmias with symptoms or device discharges may require adjunctive antiarrhythmic therapy.</p><p>In addition to ICD therapy for survivors of SCA, there are three main indications for concomitant antiarrhythmic drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-in-survivors-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To reduce the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with frequent ICD shocks. In one analysis, the occurrence of frequent ICD shocks was the primary reason for adding an antiarrhythmic drug (64 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-in-survivors-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To suppress supraventricular arrhythmias that may cause symptoms or interfere with ICD function, potentially resulting in &quot;inappropriate&quot; shocks. &quot;Inappropriate&quot; shocks result from non-life-threatening arrhythmias which meet the programmed parameters for ICD therapy, primarily based upon rate (eg, atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response exceeding the programmed threshold for delivering a shock). &quot;Inappropriate&quot; shocks have been reported in up to 29 percent of ICD patients and can have a substantial impact on the patient&rsquo;s quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-in-survivors-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These shocks are caused by a variety of arrhythmias including sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-in-survivors-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

On occasion, therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mexiletine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mexiletine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> may be useful. In general, the class I antiarrhythmic drugs are not used as the majority of patients with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) have structural heart disease, and these drugs are not recommended in patients with structural heart disease. </p><p>Pharmacologic therapy, in the form of beta blockers and antiarrhythmic medications, can be helpful in controlling arrhythmias in survivors of SCA. Virtually all patients who have survived SCA should be considered for beta blocker therapy. However, due to the efficacy of the ICD in treating sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and improving mortality, antiarrhythmic drugs are generally reserved for use in select patients as adjunctive therapy, or as primary therapy when an ICD is not indicated or refused by the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Empiric versus guided pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Empiric pharmacologic therapy for SCA survivors, primarily with beta blockers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an antiarrhythmic drug, is an effective approach for survivors of SCA who have refused ICD placement or are not candidates for an ICD. Beta blockers have some efficacy with relatively few side effects, while for most patients <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is the most efficacious antiarrhythmic drug for preventing recurrent ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p>In the past, the choice of antiarrhythmic drug was guided by objective criteria based upon either noninvasive (ambulatory electrocardiogram [ECG] monitoring) or invasive testing (electrophysiologic studies). An effective drug, identified by either technique, was noted to prevent recurrent arrhythmia and potentially improve survival compared with no therapy or an ineffective drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-in-survivors-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. In current practice, however, when pharmacologic therapy is administered to a patient with or without (because of refusal or noncandidacy for) an ICD, empiric treatment with beta blockers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is the preferred approach. Other antiarrhythmic drugs (for example <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mexiletine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mexiletine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>) are considered if there is recurrent arrhythmia despite therapy with amiodarone <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a beta blocker.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H780749578\"><span class=\"h2\">Beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all patients who have survived SCA should receive a beta blocker as part of their therapy. Beta blockers are not generally considered to be adequate monotherapy and should be used in conjunction with an antiarrhythmic drug for most patients resuscitated from SCA due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). However, the associated anti-adrenergic effects of beta blockers may be effective at reducing both arrhythmias and SCA when no specific antiarrhythmic treatment is given. In an analysis from the AVID trial, patients who were discharged from the hospital on a beta blocker had a mortality reduction compared with those patients not receiving a beta blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-in-survivors-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Most SCA survivors will have multiple indications for a beta blocker (eg, post-myocardial infarction, heart failure, etc) from which they derive clinical benefit. Beta blockers reduce the incidence of sudden death and total mortality in patients with a recent myocardial infarction and in those with symptomatic heart failure or congenital long QT syndrome. However, even in the absence of any additional indications, beta blockers should be used as part of the medical regimen following SCA due to <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myocardial infarction: Role of beta blocker therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and management of congenital long QT syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Beta blockers can potentiate the effects of class I antiarrhythmic drugs by preventing the effect of sympathetic stimulation on reversing the depressant effect on slowing conduction.

We prefer empiric therapy with amiodarone for treatment immediately following SCA in patients with recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well as for those who have refused (or are not candidates for) ICD placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-in-survivors-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Following stabilization of the patient, if there are concerns about potential toxicity related to amiodarone, particularly for anticipated long-term use, mexiletine, sotalol, or dofetilide may be considered.

Beyond reducing the likelihood of ICD shocks, however, antiarrhythmic drug therapy may impact the efficacy of ICD therapies by potentially altering defibrillation thresholds and by slowing the ventricular rates of any recurrent sustained tachyarrhythmias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20200220\"><span class=\"h2\">Alterations in DFTs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any antiarrhythmic drug can potentially alter the defibrillation threshold (DFT), although the effect has been most pronounced with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> and its major metabolite desethylamiodarone, which increase the DFT in a dose-dependent fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-in-survivors-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. DFT testing has historically been performed at the time of ICD implantation, although the routine necessity for this evaluation with the current generation of ICDs has been questioned. However, repeat DFT testing may be warranted after the initiation of amiodarone if there is concern about rising DFT thresholds (as may occur in certain clinical situations, including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and left ventricular hypertrophy).</p><p>In the report on the efficacy of routine ICD testing discussed above, 71 patients had an ICD test due to the initiation or dose-adjustment of an antiarrhythmic drug (primarily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>), and the ICD failed to defibrillate only two patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-in-survivors-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The role of ICD testing after the initiation of antiarrhythmic therapy was more directly assessed in a substudy of the OPTIC trial, in which 94 patients underwent serial ICD testing to determine the impact of each of three drug regimens (beta blockers, amiodarone plus a beta blocker, and sotalol) on DFTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-in-survivors-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 60 days after drug initiation, the mean DFT decreased from baseline in the patients assigned to beta blockers or sotalol (8.8 to 7.1 and 8.1 to 7.2 joules, respectively), while among patients taking amiodarone there was a nonsignificant increase in the mean DFT from 8.5 to 9.8 joules. Given the relatively small number of patients in each arm of this study, the small mean increase in DFT does not preclude the possibility that there may be a larger increase in some patients. Thus, the necessity for ICD testing after the initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs, primarily amiodarone, remains uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20200233\"><span class=\"h2\">VT rate slowing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients receiving chronic antiarrhythmic drug therapy, the rate of recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) is often slower than the rate seen during the index arrhythmia. This slower ventricular rate can have both positive and negative impacts on the delivery of ICD therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antitachycardia pacing is often more effective for the treatment of VT with a slower ventricular rate. When antitachycardia pacing effectively terminates the VT, the ICD does not deliver a shock and many patients will have no knowledge of the event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slower ventricular rates during VT may result in the VT falling below the previously defined rate thresholds for the ICD to detect and treat the arrhythmia. As a result, if no ICD programming changes are made, and the VT is hemodynamically significant (ie, resulting in syncope, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, or even SCA), the patient may not receive an appropriately-indicated therapy.</p><p/><p>Thus, it is common practice to lower the VT detection cutoff when initiating antiarrhythmic drug therapy, with the specific detection threshold individualized based on the specific data available from prior events in the individual patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2398151693\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Antiarrhythmic drugs can be considered as the primary therapy when an ICD is not indicated or refused by the patient. (See <a href=\"#H780748951\" class=\"local\">'Indications for pharmacologic therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearly all patients who have survived SCA should receive a beta blocker as part of their therapy, which may also provide additional antiarrhythmic benefits. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Empiric versus guided pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because an ICD does not prevent arrhythmias, patients who have arrhythmias with symptoms or device discharges may require adjunctive antiarrhythmic therapy or consideration of catheter ablation. The three main indications for concomitant antiarrhythmic drug therapy are (see <a href=\"#H780748951\" class=\"local\">'Indications for pharmacologic therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To reduce the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with frequent ICD shocks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To suppress other arrhythmias that cause symptoms or interfere with ICD function (eg, causing &quot;inappropriate&quot; shocks).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To reduce the ventricular rate of VT so that it is better tolerated hemodynamically and more amenable to termination by anti-tachycardia pacing or low-energy cardioversion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an ICD who require adjunctive antiarrhythmic therapy due to ongoing arrhythmias, we recommend treatment with the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> plus a beta blocker rather than treatment with amiodarone alone or other antiarrhythmic agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This approach is especially preferred in patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction who require adjunctive antiarrhythmic therapy, since amiodarone does not exacerbate heart failure and is less proarrhythmic than other agents. (See <a href=\"#H109254618\" class=\"local\">'Choice of pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse effects related to antiarrhythmic medications include increased defibrillation thresholds (DFTs) and slowing of the tachycardia rate, which may preclude its recognition by the ICD.
