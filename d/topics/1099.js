It rarely occurs as an isolated lesion, as it is usually associated with aortic stenosis or a ventricular septal defect. The latter disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvar aortic stenosis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All forms of AR produce a similar hemodynamic abnormality. The inability of the aortic valve leaflets to remain closed during diastole results in a portion of the left ventricular stroke volume leaking back from the aorta into the left ventricle. The added volume of regurgitant blood produces an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume; according to Laplace's law, the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume causes an elevation in wall stress. The heart responds with compensatory myocardial hypertrophy, referred to as eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy is characterized by elevated left ventricular mass, but normal mass to volume ratio, and returns wall stress towards a normal level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The combination of hypertrophy and chamber enlargement raises the total stroke volume. The net effect is that forward stroke volume and therefore cardiac output are initially maintained despite the regurgitant lesion. Although the left ventricular volume is increased, end-diastolic pressure is normal due to an increase in ventricular compliance. Thus, the heart initially adapts well to chronic AR, functioning as a very efficient and compliant high output pump.</p><p>Severe AR results in increased end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, and in the eventual failure of compensatory hypertrophy to maintain normal wall stress in the face of increasing volumes and decreased systolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Reduced aortic diastolic pressures from excessive runoff, especially during exercise, may impair coronary perfusion, while increased left atrial pressure may lead to pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many etiologies of AR (AR), which rarely occurs as an isolated lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A bicuspid aortic valve is a common cause. AR also occurs in children with Marfan syndrome, but, as described below, is more common in adults in association with progressive aortic root dilation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;</a>). Rheumatic heart disease was an important etiology in the past, but is now uncommon in developed countries. Other associations include Turner syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, subaortic stenosis, prolapse of an aortic leaflet through a ventricular septal defect (typically membranous or subpulmonary), tetralogy of Fallot, and truncus arteriosus.</p><p>AR may be an acquired lesion, following an episode of infectious endocarditis or intervention for aortic stenosis (AS), such as surgical or balloon valvuloplasty. Among patients with congenital valvar AS who are treated with balloon valvuloplasty, most have new or increased AR that, in one report, was moderate to severe in 13 percent after the procedure and in 38 percent at almost four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The risk is increased in patients undergoing repeat balloon valvuloplasty. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvar aortic stenosis in children&quot;, section on 'First-line treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination in children with AR is often subtle because most have mild disease. In addition, some of the classic findings in adults are seldom found in children, even in those with moderate to severe AR. Nevertheless, it is useful to review the classic findings that are seen in more severe disease because they can often establish the clinical diagnosis.</p><p>Both examination of the peripheral pulses and auscultation of the heart are particularly important. The increased stroke volume results in abrupt distension of the peripheral arteries and an elevation in systolic pressure. Regurgitation back into the left ventricle then leads to a rapid decline in pressure with quick collapse of the arteries, and a low diastolic pressure that can fall below 30 mmHg in severe disease.</p><p>The net effect is a wide pulse pressure, which is manifested on examination as a &quot;water hammer&quot; or Corrigan pulse. This finding may be best appreciated by palpation of the radial or brachial arteries (exaggerated by raising the arm), or the carotid pulses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;, section on 'Water hammer pulse'</a>.)</p><p>Other findings are associated with a hyperdynamic pulse:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>De Musset's sign &minus; A head bob occurring with each heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traube's sign &minus; A pistol shot pulse (systolic and diastolic sounds) heard over the femoral arteries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duroziez's sign &minus; A systolic and diastolic bruit heard when the femoral artery is partially compressed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quincke's pulses &minus; Capillary pulsations in the fingertips or lips</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mueller's sign &minus; Systolic pulsations of the uvula</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Becker's sign &minus; Visible pulsations of the retinal arteries and pupils</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hill's sign &minus; Popliteal cuff systolic pressure exceeding brachial pressure by more than 60 mmHg</p><p/><p>Exaggerated or bounding pulses and these physical signs are not specific for AR, since they can be seen in any condition associated with a marked increase in stroke volume, other aortic runoff lesions, or a hyperdynamic circulation. Causes of a hyperdynamic circulation include anemia, fever, thyrotoxicosis, large arteriovenous fistula, patent ductus arteriosus, and severe bradycardia.</p><p>The combination of left ventricular enlargement and forceful systolic function results in the apical impulse being displaced laterally and inferiorly, and being diffuse and hyperdynamic. A prominent pulsation (and occasionally a thrill) may be felt at the sternal notch due to concurrent dilatation of the ascending aorta.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac auscultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic AR is associated with changes in the heart sounds and a distinctive murmur. The heart sounds typically have the following characteristics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>S1 may be soft, often reflecting a long PR interval</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>S2 is variable; it may be soft, absent, or single</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A2 is often soft or absent, while P2 may be normal, but obscured by the diastolic murmur</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systolic ejection sound may be due to abrupt aortic distension caused by the large stroke volume</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third heart sound (S3 gallop) is heard when left ventricular function is severely depressed</p><p/><p>Mild or more AR is invariably accompanied by a diastolic murmur. In a review of the literature, the presence of an early diastolic murmur, as heard by a cardiologist, was the most useful finding for establishing the presence of AR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The diastolic murmur of AR begins immediately after A2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77962\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef77962 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76340\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76340 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56371\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56371 \">movie 3</a>). It is high pitched, often blowing in quality, and may be sustained in intensity or decrescendo. It may be soft and barely audible, often appreciated only when the patient is sitting up, leaning forward, and holding his or her breath in expiration.</p><p>The intensity of the murmur does not correlate well with the severity of AR. However, the timing and duration of the murmur may be helpful.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In mild AR, the murmur occurs only in early diastole and is blowing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the regurgitation becomes more severe, the murmur extends through more of diastole, may become holodiastolic, and is often rougher in quality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In very severe regurgitation with ventricular decompensation, the murmur may become soft or even absent. This change in character reflects the near equivalence of aortic diastolic and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, which markedly diminishes regurgitant flow. A similar situation can occur when AR is acute and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure is very high.</p><p/><p>The site at which the murmur is best heard varies with the cause. The murmur is heard best along the left sternal border, at the third and fourth intercostal space, when AR is due to valvular disease. In contrast, abnormalities of the aortic root produce murmurs that are best heard at the right sternal border and apex.</p><p>A systolic murmur can be heard in many patients. It typically resembles the ejection type of murmur heard in aortic stenosis, ie, a crescendo-decrescendo harsh murmur beginning after S1. This murmur does not necessarily reflect concurrent aortic stenosis, since the increased ejection rate and large stroke volume across the aortic valve can lead to a &quot;functional&quot; stenosis. However, as noted above, AR often occurs in association with other cardiac lesions that produce a systolic murmur, such as valvar aortic stenosis or ventricular septal defect (VSD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvar aortic stenosis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A second type of diastolic murmur (the Austin Flint murmur) may also be appreciated. This murmur is a mid- to late-diastolic rumble, heard at the apex. It is the result of antegrade turbulent diastolic blood flow from the left atrium competing with the retrograde regurgitant flow from the aorta. The latter impinges upon the anterior mitral valve leaflet opening, causing some functional stenosis. The murmur may be confused with that of mitral stenosis. Distinguishing features from mitral stenosis include the absence of both a loud S1 and an opening snap of the mitral valve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography is used to diagnose and evaluate the degree of regurgitation. It also determines the anatomy of the lesion and any accompanying disorders, and assesses ventricular function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70063\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef70063 \">movie 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53257\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53257 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54254\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef54254 \">movie 5</a>).</p><p>Serial echocardiographic assessments are used to guide management. They can also help determine the timing of aortic valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Other noninvasive tests reveal abnormalities, but provide only adjunctive additional information to echocardiography. The chest radiograph is often remarkable for a prominent ascending aorta. An enlarged left ventricle may be seen with significant regurgitation. With moderate or greater regurgitation, the electrocardiogram (ECG) frequently reveals left ventricular hypertrophy and, with advanced disease, ST-T changes due to ischemia. Cardiac catheterization is usually unnecessary. It is used only to evaluate associated lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies are available on the clinical course of AR. Most cases of AR are mild, symptoms are unusual, and the patient remains stable for many years. Progression occurs in some patients, while infective endocarditis may cause acute progression.</p><p>The natural history of isolated congenital AR was described in seven children who did not have Marfan syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The diagnosis was made in infancy in five. Three patients were asymptomatic through follow-up at 8, 10, and 20 years, while four required valve replacement at age 3, 10, 15, and 20 years for progressive severity.</p><p>Dilatation of the aorta is common in children with Marfan syndrome and progresses with time. One report followed 52 patients with Marfan syndrome through childhood and adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Aortic root dilation was present in 43 and AR in 13 (25 percent). The AR was diagnosed at a mean age of 14.6 years (none before five years) and was initially mild in all but one patient. At a mean follow-up of 7.9 years, aortic abnormalities progressed in 13, requiring aortic surgery in 10 for aortic root dilation or dissection. There is further progression in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As noted above, AR can occur in association with ventricular septal defect (VSD). One report described long-term follow-up (1946 to 1989) in 92 patients who had VSD and audible AR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Onset of AR occurred at a median age of 5.3 years. The aortic valve was bicuspid in 10 percent and tricuspid in the remainder. Surgery was performed in 72 patients, including VSD closure and valvuloplasty in 50, VSD closure and aortic valve replacement in 15, and VSD closure alone in seven.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with AR should be followed by a pediatric cardiologist at least yearly to monitor for the development of symptoms, increasing left ventricular dilation, or worsening left ventricular systolic function. More frequent evaluation is recommended in patients with moderate to severe AR or for those in whom the rate of change in their regurgitation is unclear.</p><p>The majority of children remain asymptomatic, even with severe AR. As a result, serial echocardiographic assessment, including measurement of ventricular dimensions, volumes, and function, is crucial in determining the timing of surgical repair. Surgery is recommended for patients with symptoms of heart failure, signs or symptoms of ischemia with exertion, or at the first indication of a decline in left ventricular function. Based on the 2008 joint guidelines from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology, endocarditis prophylaxis is not indicated for AR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several published reports indicate that vasodilators may be beneficial in selected asymptomatic adults with chronic AR. Little information is available in children. Thus, treatment of this disorder in children is largely based upon experience in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasodilator-therapy-in-severe-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasodilator therapy in severe chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Summarized briefly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in adults slow progression of left ventricular dysfunction in some but not all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nifedipine</a> is more predictably effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], and there are conflicting data on the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydralazine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>].</p><p>ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in children, with partial reversal of left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy. The possible benefit was illustrated in an uncontrolled series of 20 children (mean age 14.3 years) with asymptomatic chronic AR who were treated for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Captopril</a> therapy was associated with significant reductions in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, end-diastolic and end-systolic indexes, and left ventricular mass index. The regurgitant fraction was reduced by 28 percent.</p><p>The main indications for vasodilator therapy in children with AR are any degree of AR moderate or greater, or symptoms or existence of concurrent hypertension. ACE inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">captopril</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">enalapril</a> are well tolerated in children and tend to be first-line therapy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Nifedipine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydralazine</a> are second-line agents. There is no published evidence to support the long-term use of vasodilators in asymptomatic patients with only mild to moderate AR and modest left ventricular enlargement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of heart failure, signs or symptoms of ischemia with exertion, or the first indication of a decline in left ventricular systolic function are indications for aortic valve repair or replacement. While criteria for aortic valve replacement in adults also includes evidence of severe left ventricular dilation by short axis dimension with preserved systolic function, ventricular volumes have not been incorporated into the guidelines for adults. Z-score threshold values for either left ventricular short axis dimensions or volumes in the pediatric population have not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The choice between these procedures depends upon the cause of AR and the possible presence of other anatomic abnormalities.</p><p>Valve repair is effective for AR caused by balloon dilation of congenital aortic stenosis (AS), and can be used for truncal valves or prolapse of one or more cusps associated with a ventricular septal defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/8,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17-19</a>]. In one report, 21 patients, age nine months to 15 years, had surgical repair of AR following balloon dilation of congenital AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The extent of AR, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and proximal regurgitant <span class=\"nowrap\">jet/aortic</span> annulus diameter ratio were significantly decreased following repair. All patients survived and were asymptomatic at an average follow-up of 30 months. None required reoperation for late failure, although 20 percent needed reintervention by three years.</p><p>Aortic valve replacement usually requires a mechanical prosthesis and systemic anticoagulation. Bioprosthetic valves reduce the need for anticoagulation, but have a failure rate in children as high as 20 percent due to valve degeneration and progressive calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>An alternative to valve replacement with a mechanical valve or bioprosthesis is the Ross or <span class=\"nowrap\">Ross/Konno</span> procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-regurgitation-in-children/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. With this procedure, the pulmonary valve is transplanted to the aortic position, and a homograft conduit is implanted from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. Use of this technique has been limited by the high rates of failure of the pulmonary autograft and deterioration of the right heart homografts. </p><p>Aortic valve replacement and the Ross procedure in children are discussed in greater detail separately.
