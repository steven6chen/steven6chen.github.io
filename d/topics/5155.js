Depressive illness in the older population is a common and serious health concern that is associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Late-life depression remains underdiagnosed and inadequately treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. In the United States, older men and older African Americans and Hispanics are at even greater risk of unrecognized depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. The public health consequences of inadequately treated depression in late life will increase over time as the population continues to age.</p><p>Over 80 percent of mental health treatment for depressed older adults is delivered in the primary care setting. Depression often goes undiagnosed in primary care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and is often left untreated, even when diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Recognition and management of late-life depression is an important responsibility for the primary care clinician. Either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy can benefit patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of late-life unipolar depression. The clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of unipolar major depression in mixed age adults are discussed separately.

Sadness and grief are normal responses to life events that occur with aging such as bereavement; adjustment to changes in social status with retirement and loss of income; transition from independent living to assisted or residential care; and loss of physical, social, or cognitive function from illness (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features&quot;</a>). Despite these losses, healthy independent community-dwelling elderly in the United States have a lower prevalence rate of clinical depression than the general adult population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71214\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71214 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Rates of depression for community-dwelling older adults range from 2 percent (for patients in community settings who meet strict diagnostic interview criteria) to about 10 percent for patients with minor depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Cultural factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] as well as variations in methods of assessment lead to significant variations in reported prevalence. Rates of depression are higher for older adults with comorbid medical illness and in general medical settings. Hospitalized geriatric populations have prevalence rates of depression over 30 percent, and patients with stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or cancer have rates over 40 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71214\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71214 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>Although prevalence of depression in the older healthy population is lower than in comparable younger groups, incidence rates may not differ. A cohort study of 5600 community dwelling persons in the Netherlands, aged 56 or older (mean age 70 years at baseline) and followed for eight years, found the incidence of depressive syndromes (major depression and dysthymia) to be 7 per 1,000 person years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Most depressive episodes occurred in persons with a prior history of depression, with a recurrence rate of 25.5 per 1,000 person years. Clinically significant but subthreshold depressive symptoms occurred at twice the rate of depressive syndromes.</p><p>The true incidence of depressive disorders in the oldest-old (&gt;85 years old) may be underestimated. This group may have an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms, although few epidemiologic studies have included participants of these ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who experience their first episode of depression later in life are less likely to have a family history of depression or other major mental disorder than patients whose first episode occurred earlier in life.

To some extent, this may also be an artifact of how depression is defined and symptoms are elicited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].

A meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials (380 elderly depressed patients) found a significant, clinically large effect favoring CBT over treatment as usual or waiting list controls; heterogeneity across studies was small to moderate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].

However, there was a higher withdrawal rate due to side effects for patients treated with tricyclic antidepressants, compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These findings suggest that side effect profiles should be a major determinant in medication selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/132,133\" class=\"abstract_t\">132,133</a>].</p><p>Medications typically take up to four to six weeks to show efficacy.

However, one study of 472 older patients with major depression found that patients who had no improvement at all by 4 weeks of treatment were unlikely to respond even after 8 additional weeks, and would be candidates for an early change in their treatment plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].</p><p>Monotherapy is preferred in the elderly in order to minimize drug side effects and drug-drug interactions.

Lower starting doses will compensate for decreased drug clearance in the elderly, minimize initial side effects, and promote medication compliance and maintenance. However, under-treatment of elderly depressed patients is well documented; it is important to reach the same therapeutic dosage range as in younger adults in order to maximize the chances of achieving complete remission.</p><p>Patients should be contacted or seen within two weeks of initiating medication to discuss tolerance, address concerns, and adjust dose as indicated. Patients should have an office visit within two to four weeks of initiation of medication treatment to assess for response, complications, or deterioration. Depression-specific case management, (involving specially trained nurses or social workers collaborating with primary care physicians to assist with depression identification, guideline-based treatment and follow-up) was effective, compared with usual care, in reducing mortality and depressive symptoms in older patients with major depression in a randomized trial involving 20 primary care practices in three US cities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>].

The goal of continuation and maintenance treatment is to prevent relapse. Relapse rates in the elderly are higher than in younger populations, which may indicate a need for longer periods of maintenance therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. Prior to discontinuing maintenance treatment, clinicians should educate patients about monitoring themselves for symptoms of recurrent episodes, and restarting treatment if symptoms recur.</p><p>Evidence for the efficacy of maintenance treatment includes a meta-analysis of six randomized trials that compared antidepressants (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a>, dothiepin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>) with placebo for up to three years in 708 elderly patients who remitted from unipolar major depressive episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. Recurrent episodes occurred in fewer patients who received antidepressants than placebo (37 versus 59 percent). In addition, discontinuation of treatment due to side effects was comparable.</p><p>Maintenance treatment with monthly psychotherapy, either alone or as add-on treatment with pharmacotherapy, does not appear to be effective for preventing recurrent late life depressive episodes. As an example, a two year randomized maintenance trial found that interpersonal psychotherapy did not prevent recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>].

Studies in adult populations younger than age 65 suggest that chronic antidepressant therapy should be considered for patients with three or more serious episodes of depression before age 50. However, similar data are lacking for treatment of recurrent depression in older populations and consultation with a psychiatrist may be helpful in such cases, too.</p><p>Discontinuing antidepressants may be prompted by tachyphylaxis or side effects, or by the need to initiate another medication that may cause a drug-drug interaction with the existing antidepressant. Development of an intercurrent illness, especially of major organ, cerebral, or systemic disease, may also make continuation of antidepressants problematic. Long term safety data on chronic antidepressant use in the elderly with chronic comorbid medical conditions are lacking.</p><p>Additional information about continuation and maintenance treatment is discussed separately.
