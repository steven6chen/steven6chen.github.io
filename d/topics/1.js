AZA is a prodrug that is metabolized to 6-MP, which is then further metabolized along an anabolic pathway to several metabolites including 6-TG and 6-MMP. Two enzymes are responsible for catalyzing these reactions: thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72170\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72170 \">figure 1</a>). 6-TG levels between 230 and 400 may correlate with response and remission of inflammatory bowel disease. Bone marrow suppression may correlate with elevated levels of 6-TG greater than 400, while elevated levels of 6-MMP levels greater than 5700 may correlate with liver toxicity, manifested as increased liver enzymes.</p><p>This topic will review 6-MP metabolite monitoring and TPMT testing in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and the discussion is generally consistent with the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline on therapeutic drug monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Genotype or phenotype testing is suggested by the manufacturer and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It may be particularly important in African American patients who tend to have lower baseline white blood cell counts.

Approximately 89 percent of the population has wild type TPMT, which is associated with normal or &quot;high&quot; TPMT enzyme activity, while 11 percent are heterozygous and have corresponding low TPMT enzyme activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Most importantly, 0.3 percent (1 in 300) of the population is homozygous for mutations of TPMT and thus have negligible activity, which causes 6-MP to be preferentially metabolized to produce high levels of 6-TG, which then leads to bone marrow suppression. Intermediate and normal metabolizers can have up to a threefold difference in initial target doses of AZA and 6-MP to achieve therapeutic 6-TG concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">TPMT genotyping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic polymorphism of TPMT causes some individuals to be particularly vulnerable to side effects and makes empiric dose-adjustments of AZA and 6-MP riskier.

Multiple studies have described the use of TPMT genotyping or measurement of activity in predicting toxicity. As a general rule, these have demonstrated that prediction of toxicity is possible in some patients but is not consistently reliable. An illustrative report included 67 patients receiving AZA for rheumatic disease, six of whom were heterozygous for mutant TPMT alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In comparison, the median duration of therapy was 39 weeks in those with wild type alleles.</p><p>Even though TPMT testing is performed, a complete blood count (CBC), and also liver function tests, must still be obtained as the majority of patients who develop myelosuppression while taking AZA do not have detectable TPMT gene mutations. This was illustrated in a study that included 41 patients who developed myelosuppression during treatment with AZA and in whom only 27 percent had mutant alleles of the TPMT gene associated with enzyme deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>There continues to be variation among experts in how TPMT genotyping results should be used.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some authorities recommend that all patients undergo baseline TPMT genotype testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].

However, a clear benefit of a more aggressive approach is unproven. Rapid achievement of therapeutic levels with intravenous azathioprine loading did not shorten time to remission compared with standard oral dosing in a randomized controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Those with absent TPMT enzyme activity should not receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or 6-mercaptopurine. Those with low (&lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/mL)</span> enzyme activity can be treated with low-dose 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine at doses of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of 6-mercaptopurine per day or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> azathioprine per day combined with careful monitoring of CBC, liver function tests, and 6-TG plus 6-MMP levels. IBD patients with TPMT enzyme activity between 5 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/mL</span> may be more likely to respond to a more moderate dosing strategy (such as 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of 6-mercaptopurine per day or 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> azathioprine per day). In those with above average (&gt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/mL)</span> enzyme activity, high doses of 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine such as 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of 6-mercaptopurine per day or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> azathioprine per day may be needed to achieve a favorable clinical response.

Similarly, other medications can affect azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine metabolism. Thus, it is important to consider drug interactions. 5-ASA drugs, for example, can reversibly inhibit TPMT activity and thus lead to corresponding increases in 6-TG with resultant leukopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Allopurinol</a> inhibits the enzyme xanthine oxidase and should be avoided, since concomitant use can potentially lead to life-threatening bone marrow suppression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1994681977\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should have a complete blood count and liver chemistries at least every other week for six to eight weeks after beginning <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or 6-mercaptopurine and following a dose adjustment, and at least once every three months thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1783998803\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic drug monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) have demonstrated that therapeutic efficacy correlates with concentrations of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) between 230 and 400, that bone marrow suppression correlates with concentrations of 6-TG greater than 400, and that liver toxicity correlates with concentrations of 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) greater than 5000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>]. No correlation was found between therapeutic efficacy and 6-MMP levels. A 2006 meta-analysis of 12 studies found a significant association between 6-TG levels and the likelihood of clinical remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Most studies were small, and there was significant heterogeneity between studies. However, a 2013 meta-analysis that included 10 studies using the same reference method for measuring 6-TG levels also demonstrated that clinical remission was significantly more likely among patients with 6-TG levels over a cut-off value between 230 and 260 (odds ratio 3.2, 95% CI 2.4-4.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'TPMT genotyping'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concentrations of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) between 230 and 400 correlate with an increased likelihood of obtaining a therapeutic response and remission while 6-MMP levels greater than 5000 correlate with the increased possibility of liver toxicity. However, their value in guiding dose changes to optimize treatment in individual patients remains unsettled. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Following 6-TG levels for optimal dosing of AZA or 6-MP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In non-responding patients who have been prescribed what is believed to be a therapeutic dose of AZA or 6-MP we suggest obtaining 6-TG and 6-MMP levels. Low levels may support clinical suspicion of non-compliance, although there are alternative explanations. Such patients may be on too low a dose of AZA or 6-MP or may have preferential metabolism of AZA or 6-MP toward 6-MMP instead of toward 6-TG. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Demonstration of AZA/6-MP non-compliance or resistance'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Feuerstein JD, Nguyen GC, Kupfer SS, et al.
