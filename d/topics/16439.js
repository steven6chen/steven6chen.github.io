This &quot;traditional&quot; approach accepts the Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry definitions of acids and bases. The hydrogen ion concentration is expressed in blood as a function of the ratio between the PCO2 and the serum bicarbonate concentration as defined by the following equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;[H+] &#160;= &#160;K &#160;x &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">PCO2/[HCO3-]</span></p></div></div><p>where K is the dissociation constant for the reaction and PCO2 is equal to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide.</p><p>An analysis of metabolic acidosis using the traditional approach is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By comparison, many surgeons, critical care specialists, and anesthesiologists have embraced an approach introduced by Peter Stewart in 1981 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. This alternative approach, termed &quot;strong ion difference&quot; (SID) or the Stewart approach, will be reviewed briefly in this topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STRONG ION DIFFERENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardinal tenet of the Stewart approach is that the serum bicarbonate concentration does not alter blood pH. Stewart defined acids as ions that shift the dissociation equilibrium of water to a higher concentration of H+ and a lower concentration of OH-. This is in contrast to the Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry approach, which defines acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors.</p><p>The Stewart approach is based upon mathematics and simple physicochemical principles. Stewart identified six simultaneous equations that define the hydrogen ion concentration in terms of its dissociation equilibrium with various constituents present in plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A polynomial solution for the six simultaneous equations solved for the hydrogen ion concentration led to the conclusion that the serum bicarbonate is a dependent and not an independent variable. As a result, the serum bicarbonate concentration is <strong>not</strong> a determinant of blood pH.</p><p>According to this theory as modified by Figge and Watson, the independent variables responsible for changes in acid-base balance are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;strong ion difference&quot; or &quot;SID,&quot; the difference between the completely dissociated cations and anions in plasma. Because not all strong ions can be measured, the &quot;apparent SID&quot; or &quot;SIDapp&quot; is calculated from the net charge of the major strong cations: Na+, K+, Ca++, Mg++, and the major strong anions: Cl- and lactate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The plasma concentration of nonvolatile weak acids (ATot). As opposed to strong ions, weak acids can exist at physiologic pH as dissociated (A-) or associated with a proton (AH). ATot = A- + AH. Weak acids are often referred to as buffers. In health, ATot is comprised primarily of phosphate and the ion equivalence of the albumin concentration; in the absence of unmeasured ions, A- is equal to the anion gap (see below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2).</p><p/><p>Because clinically important acid-base derangements are thought to result from changes in PaCO2, SID, and ATot, the strong ion approach distinguishes six primary acid-base disturbances. These are respiratory acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, strong ion acidosis, strong ion alkalosis, nonvolatile buffer ion acidosis, and nonvolatile buffer ion alkalosis. The traditional approach to these issues is discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews on metabolic and respiratory acidosis and alkalosis.</p><p>Clinically, the &quot;apparent SID&quot; (SIDapp) is defined as the difference between the sum of the strong cations (Na+, K+, Ca++, Mg++) and the sum of the net charge of major strong anions present in health (Cl- and lactate):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;SIDapp = [Na+] + [K+] + [Ca++] + [Mg++] - [Cl-] - [lactate-]</p></div></div><p>Under normal conditions, the SIDapp is approximately 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L;</span> processes that increase the strong ion difference increase blood pH, whereas processes that reduce it decrease pH. As an example, the loss of gastric fluid, which has a higher concentration of chloride than cation, increases the SIDapp, causing alkalosis; by comparison, infusion of sodium chloride, a solution with a SID of zero, reduces the SIDapp, and is therefore acidifying. The Stewart approach attributes gastric alkalosis to excessive loss of chloride (and its effect on SID) rather than to loss of hydrogen ion and it attributes acidosis caused by large volume saline infusions to the excessive gain of chloride rather than to dilution of the serum bicarbonate concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Strong ion gap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since SID is a function of pH and ATot, it can be calculated from measured values of pH, serum albumin, and phosphate. The calculated value, called the &quot;effective strong ion difference&quot; or &quot;SIDeff,&quot; is expressed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F59352\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59352 \">table 1</a>):</p><p>The difference between SIDapp and SIDeff is the &quot;strong ion gap&quot; or SIG:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;SIG &#160;= &#160;SIDapp &#160;- &#160;SIDeff</p></div></div><p>The strong ion gap should be zero. A positive value suggests a possible organic acidosis due to endogenous acids or the intake of exogenous acids or acid precursors (eg, methanol, ethylene glycol, or salicylates).</p><p>Given the complexity of these equations, preprogrammed calculators are available that permit clinicians to enter the variables that determine the strong ion gap. A print out subsequently defines the acid-base disturbance in terms of the Stewart approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">STRONG ION VERSUS TRADITIONAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Stewart or strong ion approach to acid-base disturbances has gained acceptance among many intensivists because of perceived weaknesses of the traditional approach in the evaluation of patients with critical illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The major practical difference between the two approaches is the inclusion of the serum albumin concentration in the Stewart approach, which provides some increase in accuracy in certain clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>However, if serum albumin concentration is considered in the traditional analysis of acid-base disturbances, we feel that the Stewart approach offers no advantage over the traditional Schwartz-Bartter approach to acid-base disturbances. In addition, the Stewart approach is much more complex and may be more prone to error, given its reliance upon multiple measurements of several variables. When measurements obtained from automated blood chemistry devices are used to calculate the strong ion gap (SIG), the results can also vary substantially depending upon which device is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We therefore prefer the traditional approach in the analysis of all acid-base disturbances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative diagnostic efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some evidence has suggested that the Stewart approach provides more accurate analysis of acid-base disturbances than the traditional approach. One study of 255 patients in a pediatric intensive care unit who had simultaneous measurements of arterial blood gases, electrolytes, and serum albumin concentration found that 26 percent of patients had a different interpretation of acid-base balance when the Stewart approach was used compared to when the conventional approach was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The Stewart method was superior to the traditional method in identifying patients with high lactate levels.</p><p>However, this benefit vanishes when hypoalbuminemia, a common problem in hospitalized patients, is accurately considered when using the conventional approach. To best understand this, a brief review of traditional analysis using the anion gap (AG) is required.</p><p>In the evaluation of metabolic acidosis, the AG serves to differentiate a hyperchloremic acidosis (normal gap) from high AG acidosis associated with increased concentrations of nonvolatile anions other than chloride [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Negative charges on plasma albumin are a large component of the unmeasured anions that contribute to the calculated AG in normal subjects. Thus, the presence of hypoalbuminemia, if not considered, will mask the presence of an organic acidosis when the clinician relies upon the AG for analysis.</p><p>It is possible to adjust for the effect of low serum levels of albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Each 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> decrease or increase in serum albumin below or above 4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> respectively lowers or raises the actual concentration of unmeasured anions by approximately 2.3 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With appropriate adjustments for hypoalbuminemia, the traditional and Stewart approach are similarly accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. This was shown in a study of 50 consecutive patients with metabolic acidosis who were admitted to a critical care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There was no advantage of the Stewart approach over the traditional approach to acid-base disturbances augmented by the albumin-corrected AG. Although the uncorrected anion gap failed to detect increased blood lactate levels, there was a strong correlation (r2 = 0.932) between the strong ion gap and the albumin-corrected anion gap.</p><p>Acid-base analyses based upon the strong ion difference (SID) require multiple measurements of several variables, each subject to error. This may be a particular problem when point of care measurements are used for these measurements because of the larger errors associated with these devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are conflicting data concerning the relative prognostic value of the Stewart versus the traditional approach; however, on average, the AG corrected for albumin and SIG perform equally well in predicting mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 255 patients in a pediatric intensive care unit who had simultaneous measurements of arterial blood gases, electrolytes, and serum albumin concentration, 26 percent of patients had a different interpretation of acid-base balance when the Stewart approach was used compared to when the conventional approach was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The calculation of SIG, the effective strong ion difference (SIDeff), and the apparent SID (SIDapp) offered no advantage as prognostic markers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 78 consecutive adults admitted to an intensive care unit for hemorrhagic shock caused by major trauma found that indicators of unmeasured anions (AG or SIG) were strongly associated with hospital mortality whereas pH and lactate were of limited value as predictors; the source of the unmeasured anions that are generated by critical illness has not been defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

However, statistical comparisons between these measures are difficult because the variables used to calculate them are interconnected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a larger study of 6878 patients admitted to an intensive care unit, the SIG, SIDapp, SIDeff, AG, and albumin-corrected AG did not differ as predictors of mortality, and all were inferior to the arterial lactate concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strong-ions-and-the-analysis-of-acid-base-disturbances-stewart-approach/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most internists use the traditional approach to acid-base analysis, which relies upon the definition of the hydrogen ion concentration in blood as a function of the ratio between the PCO2 and the serum bicarbonate concentration.
