In the developed world, the most common etiologies of MR are degenerative disease with mitral valve prolapse (a primary cause) and coronary heart disease (a secondary cause).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3447251631\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary MR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several disease processes cause abnormalities of the mitral valve complex leading to primary MR.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degenerative mitral valve disease (mitral valve prolapse, partial flail, and flail leaflet) includes a range of disorders ranging from myxomatous mitral valve disease (also known as myxomatous degeneration, with redundancy of anterior and posterior mitral leaflets and the chordae), seen primarily in younger populations, and fibroelastic deficiency disease, seen primarily in older populations. It is not clear if these are two distinct disease processes or manifestations of a single disease. In mitral valve prolapse, excessive mitral leaflet tissues lead to folding and hooding effecting one or more segments of one or both leaflets. Chordae are elongated and may rupture, and the annulus is typically dilated and frequently disjuncted from its normal myocardial support. The alterations yield insufficient apposition of the rough zones of the mitral leaflets so they no longer support each other during systole and fall into the left atrium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse#H28356921\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with acute rheumatic carditis, the intensity and time course of the inflammatory process may impact the course of mitral valve disease. Severe inflammation of the chordal structures and mitral valve leaflets can lead to isolated MR, seen predominantly in children and young adults. Moderate chordal and leaflet inflammation, which may be exacerbated by repeated acute rheumatic carditis, may lead to mixed MR and mitral stenosis. Chronic chordal and leaflet inflammation may be exacerbated by repeated acute rheumatic carditis, which may lead to mitral stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104279\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104279 \">algorithm 1</a>).

In addition, patients with pre-existing valve disease (eg, mitral valve prolapse or rheumatic valve disease) are at increased risk for developing infective endocarditis.

The prevalence of mitral annular calcification increases with age.

In contrast to prolapse, where the leaflet tip remains attached to the papillary muscle with the tip pointing towards the LV apex, flail is defined as the loss of the normal leaflet attachment to the LV myocardium so that the leaflet tip points toward the roof of the left atrium. The leaflet is considered flail when most of the anterior or posterior leaflet is detached from the papillary muscle; a partial flail involves only one scallop or smaller segment of the leaflet. Causes of flail or partial flail mitral leaflet include mitral valve prolapse, infective endocarditis, trauma, and rupture of a papillary muscle in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction. With papillary muscle rupture, the detached papillary muscle head remains attached to the leaflet, moving into the left atrium in systole. Acute flail leaflet can cause acute hemodynamic decompensation while partial flail may cause subacute symptoms or no early symptoms but chronic risk of adverse cardiac events including heart failure and death.

LV systolic dysfunction can contribute to secondary MR, but the severity of the MR correlates weakly with the LV ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This is likely because the nature and extent of LV dysfunction is only partially captured by the global LV ejection fraction.</p><p>The term &quot;papillary muscle dysfunction&quot; was previously used in the literature to describe patients with ischemic MR, but this is a misnomer since papillary muscle dysfunction does not adequately explain the mechanism of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/7,13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,18</a>]. The mechanism for MR in this setting is better described as &quot;papillary muscle displacement&quot; due to dysfunction of underlying LV wall and associated alteration of ventricular geometry, as was illustrated by an animal model of ischemic MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In an echocardiographic study of 95 patients with a first inferior MI, advanced wall motion abnormality of the posterobasal segment of the LV was the most significant independent variable associated with ischemic MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Echocardiographic studies of functional MR have shown that regurgitant flow varies throughout systole: There is an early systolic peak, a midsystolic decrease, and a smaller late systolic peak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

These variations occur in association with changes in regurgitant orifice area and are more closely associated with changes in transmitral pressure gradient than with mitral annular area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The ratio of flow at the two peaks also correlates with QRS duration.

The major burden and threat is to the pulmonary venous circulation and the lungs, sometimes leading to pulmonary edema.

As this new steady state develops, the small hyperkinetic chamber of acute MR is converted into a large compliant chamber that is well suited to deliver a large stroke volume. This comes about through a rearrangement of myocardial fibers, with the addition of new sarcomeres and the development of eccentric LV hypertrophy. The net effect is that the changes in LV loading conditions seen in acute MR tend to be reversed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite LV chamber enlargement, preload at the level of the sarcomere returns toward normal or near normal levels, and preload reserve is re-established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The systolic unloading that is characteristic of acute MR is gradually replaced by normal systolic wall stresses (normal afterload) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, the enhanced total stroke volume seen in chronic compensated mitral regurgitation is &quot;mediated through normal performance of each unit of an enlarged circumference&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In other words, LV contractility, loading conditions (sarcomere length and afterload), and ejection fraction remain within the range of normal with the large end-diastolic volume responsible for the enhanced total stroke volume. An enlarged compliant atrium contributes to a decline in pulmonary venous pressures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186250919\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic decompensated MR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this late phase of chronic MR there is substantial LV enlargement, eccentric geometry, and afterload excess with depressed ejection fraction. The low ejection fraction is a consequence of afterload excess and depressed myocardial contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The transition from a compensated to decompensated phase is discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1399247597\"><span class=\"h2\">Afterload and MR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MR provides an alternate pathway for LV ejection and this has traditionally been thought to produce a decrease in LV afterload. While this may be true in acute severe MR, data suggest that LV afterload is normal in patients with compensated chronic MR and increased in those with chronic decompensated MR. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2136828561\"><span class=\"h3\">Definitions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LV afterload can be considered the load or force developed by the ventricle during systole and is best measured as systolic wall stress. Afterload or wall stress and myocardial fiber shortening are inversely related. As a result, an increase in afterload will be accompanied by a decrease in shortening (or ejection fraction), while a decrease in afterload will be accompanied by an increase in shortening (or ejection fraction).</p><p>Stress is defined as the force or load per unit cross-sectional area of a material (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span>. This is an engineering term used to compare loads borne by different sized elements of a material. In a spherical model of the LV, wall stress is directly proportional to the product of transmural pressure and chamber radius divided by the wall thickness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58408\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58408 \">figure 1</a>).</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;LV wall stress &#160; = &#160; (P &#160;x &#160;R) &#160;&divide; &#160;(2 &#160;x &#160;Th) </p></div></div><p>where P = pressure, R = radius, and Th = wall thickness. As a result, if a given hemodynamic load (pressure) is borne by a smaller amount of a material (myocardium), the stress on that material will be greater.</p><p>However, this mathematical definition of LV wall stress is overly simplistic since:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Geometry in the LV is more complex than that represented by a simple sphere. Ellipsoidal or cylindrical models more accurately represent the ventricle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several components of stress exist within the wall of the ventricle. Meridional stresses are directed from apex to base while circumferential or hoop stresses are directed circumferentially at the equator.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wall stress varies over time since LV pressure, radius, and wall thickness are continuously changing throughout the cardiac cycle. As a result, afterload can be calculated at the instant of aortic valve opening, at the end of ejection, or at any instant throughout systole. Clinical investigators use peak systolic stress, end-systolic stress, or mean systolic stress as indices of afterload.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1028537350\"><span class=\"h3\">Afterload in chronic MR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive and invasive data indicate that wall stress is normal or increased with chronic MR. </p><p>As an example, noninvasive (echocardiographic) measurements of LV volume, mass, and function in one study of patients with chronic MR showed that meridional wall stresses were not reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Indeed, peak-systolic stress tended to be increased. End-systolic stress was normal in compensated MR, but was increased significantly in decompensated MR.</p><p>Another report confirmed these observations using invasive (cardiac catheterization) hemodynamic and angiographic measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Peak-systolic stress was modestly increased in both compensated and decompensated hearts; end-systolic wall stress was especially high in decompensated MR.

Impedance (and resistance) to retrograde flow in chronic MR exceeds that of forward flow, except in the most severe MR (eg, acute severe MR with a regurgitant fraction above 57 percent). Thus, the regurgitant lesion should not be characterized as a &quot;low impedance leak.&quot; Nevertheless, the total impedance to LV emptying in MR is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The enlarged double-outlet ventricle with a low total impedance to emptying produces a large total stroke volume, while the afterload and ejection fraction remain normal. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1510099940\"><span class=\"h3\">Afterload following corrective surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Published data do not support the notion that surgical correction of chronic MR uniformly produces a postoperative increase in systolic wall stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/29,30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30,32</a>]. Increased afterload may contribute to a decline in ejection fraction in patients with decompensated MR, especially if chordal preservation techniques are not employed. In compensated ventricles, however, afterload does not increase postoperatively with valve replacement or repair.</p><p>The functional state of the LV before surgery and the nature of the corrective surgery both influence the LV response to surgical correction of the regurgitant lesion.

Such differences in the response to surgery can be illustrated in the form of stress-dimension plots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F114078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114078 \">figure 2</a>) and can be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with compensated MR generally develop a salutary decrease in LV chamber volumes after valve replacement and as a result, systolic wall stress remains normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with decompensated MR have persistent postoperative LV enlargement and an increase in end-systolic stress.</p><p/><p>The decrease in fiber shortening and ejection fraction in decompensated MR is related in part to a postoperative change in ventricular geometry and an increase in afterload.

However, differences were observed in their effects on ejection fraction. Valve replacement caused a significant decline in ejection fraction (60&plusmn;10 versus 48&plusmn;10 percent, before and after surgery, respectively) while valve repair was associated with little change (64&plusmn;5 versus 61&plusmn;16 percent).</p><p>The different effects on ejection fraction from the two procedures can be explained by severance of the chordae tendineae with valve replacement and preservation of the subvalvular apparatus with repair. This is illustrated by a study in which ventricular function in patients undergoing valve replacement with chordal preservation was compared with that in patients undergoing valve replacement with chordal transection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Postoperatively, afterload was lower and the ejection fraction was higher in the patients with chordal preservation.</p><p>A second retrospective study of 612 patients undergoing mitral valve repair or replacement also reported that preservation of the subvalvular apparatus improved outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Mortality at 30 days was lower in the patients undergoing valve repair or replacement with subvalvular apparatus preservation compared with those with replacement without preservation (1.8 and 1.5 versus 5 percent).

Although these patients appear to be asymptomatic, some have impaired functional capacity and reduced exercise tolerance.

In principle, corrective surgery should be performed during the transition from a compensated to decompensated phase of the disease (ie, before the decompensated phase is established).

Such a change may occur as a consequence of progressive increments in the regurgitant volume <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an increase in LV chamber size. The decompensated phase is characterized by substantial and progressive ventricular enlargement with increased LV diastolic pressures, increased systolic wall stress, and a decline in the ejection fraction; the fall in ejection fraction is a consequence of a depressed contractile state and excessive afterload. These changes in LV size and function are often accompanied by progressive atrial enlargement, atrial arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and eventually the signs and symptoms of heart failure.</p><p>Some patients experience fatigue, limited exercise tolerance, or even dyspnea during this transition. In such patients, the decision to proceed with surgery is relatively easy and the results are generally good. Other patients, however, may proceed through the transition period and show evidence of LV dysfunction with minimal or no symptoms. Such patients have reached a decompensated phase in which LV and left atrial dysfunction become irreversible and it may be too late to expect an optimal result from corrective surgery.</p><p>If an optimal response to surgery is the goal, it is important to identify such a patient before the development of irreversible changes in LV size and function.

In the developed world, the most common etiologies of MR are degenerative mitral valve disease (a primary cause) and coronary heart disease (a secondary cause).

These compensatory adjustments vary over the prolonged course of the disorder. In severe MR, the myocardium eventually fails, the ventricle decompensates, and the patient exhibits signs of heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H188935814\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac response to MR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal LV systolic wall stress occurs in chronic MR because of opposing effects of LV dilation and hypertrophy (with maintenance of a normal ratio of thickness to radius). Increased wall stress is seen when LV dilation is not accompanied by adequate hypertrophy (with decreased ratio of wall thickness to radius).

In compensated ventricles, however, afterload does not increase postoperatively with valve repair or replacement with chordal preservation.
