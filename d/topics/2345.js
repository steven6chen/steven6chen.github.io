A single giant bulla may be surrounded by normal lung tissue or may be accompanied by a number of smaller adjacent bullae. Bullectomy involves the surgical removal of one or more giant bullae to improve symptoms and respiratory function in patients with bullous emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>The indications and contraindications for bullectomy, as well as the perioperative management and operative technique of bullectomy will be reviewed here. The evaluation and medical management of giant bullae in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the roles of lung volume reduction surgery and lung transplantation in the management of advanced COPD are discussed separately.

At five years following surgery, these parameters remained improved compared to prebullectomy values, although the degree of improvement had declined. Patients with diffuse emphysema deteriorated faster than patients without diffuse emphysema.</p><p>A systematic review of bullectomy for giant bullae noted that hypoxemia was more likely to improve compared with spirometric parameters or diffusing capacity (DLCO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients with radiographic evidence of compressed lung were most to likely experience improved oxygenation, whereas patients with radiographically diffuse emphysema, a low DLCO, or hypercapnia were less likely to improve, although the exact degree of improvement was not described.</p><p>The degree of improvement in the arterial tension of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) reported in a separate series of 43 patients was modest (approximately 8 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, the proportion of patients requiring supplemental oxygen decreased from 42 percent before to 9 percent one year after bullectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Over the next three years, there was a gradual increase in the percent requiring continuous oxygen up to 21 percent.</p><p>Improvements in exercise tolerance following giant bullectomy were noted in other case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. In a series of 12 patients, improvements were noted in aerobic exercise capacity and dynamic inspiratory capacity (ie, a decrease in dynamic hyperinflation) relative to baseline values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A modest reduction in the partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (mean of 43 to 40 mmHg) was noted in one series, although the improvement was no longer present at three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Patients who present with a spontaneous secondary pneumothorax associated with a giant bulla have a high rate of recurrent pneumothorax and generally require pleurodesis even if a bullectomy is not indicated, such as a patient with diffuse bullous emphysema. Mediastinal shift <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> herniation due to a giant bulla have been mentioned as additional clinical indications, although outcomes data are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>An important challenge for the clinician is to select the patient for bullectomy who can benefit the most with the lowest morbidity and mortality. One factor that suggests that bullectomy may be particularly beneficial is a bulla that occupies greater than approximately 30 percent of the hemithorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/6,9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,14</a>]. Radiographic evidence that the bulla is compressing adjacent normal (rather than emphysematous) pulmonary parenchyma (ie, radiographic signs of atelectasis or adjacent vascular crowding) is also a favorable factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other specific characteristics in favor of bullectomy are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68646 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Limited information is available regarding the use of pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters to guide the decision to perform bullectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The majority of patients who undergo bullectomy have a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) that is below 80 percent predicted, but greater than or equal to 40 percent predicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a series of 18 patients, a better clinical response to bullectomy was noted in those with an FEV<sub>1</sub> greater than 40 percent predicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In contrast, the mean FEV<sub>1</sub> in a series of 43 patients who benefited from bullectomy was 34 percent predicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and the median FEV<sub>1</sub> was 26 percent in a more recent series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], suggesting that this criterion is not absolute in otherwise carefully selected patients.</p><p>In general, patients who will benefit from bullectomy have PFT evidence of air trapping (eg, total lung capacity [TLC] &gt;100 percent predicted, residual volume [RV] &gt;150 percent predicted) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>].</p><p>The difference in lung volume measurements obtained by the body plethysmography and helium dilution techniques can be compared to estimate the volume of nonventilated lung. A larger nonventilated volume suggests that the patient is likely to derive greater benefit from bullectomy. Chest computed tomography (CT) scanning provides a direct visual assessment of the extent to which normal lung is compressed by bullae and complements the physiologic measures.

As no randomized trials of bullectomy have been performed, most of the contraindications derive from case series and experience with lung volume reduction surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung volume reduction surgery in COPD&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Age over 50 has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in some older studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18</a>]. However, in a series of 41 patients undergoing bullectomy, patients up to age 77 were included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. No increase in risk was associated with older age, although results were not stratified based on age. In a separate series of 43 patients, the mean age was 56, and age was not a risk factor for mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, we now view age over 60 as a less favorable feature, but not a contraindication.</p><p>A markedly reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) (eg, less than 500 mL or less than 40 percent of predicted) is associated with an increased risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/7,13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,19</a>] in some, but not all, series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Hypercapnia and cor pulmonale are also associated with markedly increased risk and are considered relative contraindications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/6,9,13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,13,19</a>]. As an example, significant cor pulmonale was associated with 33 percent mortality in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>A diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) less than 40 percent predicted is considered a contraindication to bullectomy, as it suggests a greater degree of diffuse underlying emphysema and is associated with a greater likelihood of postoperative air leaks and a poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A cohort study of 63 patients suggested that presence of underlying emphysema was not associated with lesser symptomatic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-medical-management-of-giant-bullae#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and medical management of giant bullae&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary function tests'</a>.)</p><p>In the systematic review of giant bullectomy, patients with chronic sputum production or frequent lung infections were less likely to improve than those without these clinical characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of the preoperative evaluation for bullectomy (eg, arterial blood gases, pulmonary function tests, radiographic imaging) is performed while determining whether the patient fits the indications and contraindications for bullectomy. The details of this evaluation are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-medical-management-of-giant-bullae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and medical management of giant bullae&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1372276\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical optimization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with giant bullae who are referred for bullectomy typically have a baseline degree of respiratory insufficiency and are at increased risk for perioperative complications. Underlying COPD should be treated aggressively with an appropriate combination of an inhaled glucocorticoid, long-acting anticholinergic agent, and long-acting beta-agonist to achieve the best possible baseline level of function. Inhaled agents are normally administered the morning of surgery. Inhaled bronchodilator agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>) can be delivered through the circuit of the ventilator during surgery, as needed. For the rare patient using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>, this medication is discontinued the evening before surgery as it interacts with many of the drugs used perioperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-patients-with-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease#H46738270\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;, section on 'Perioperative medication management'</a>.)</p><p>Baseline pulse oximetry values and requirement for supplemental oxygen should be noted.</p><p>Preoperative assessment for coronary artery disease is prudent given the increased risk among patients with COPD. Uncontrolled coronary heart disease would be a contraindication to bullectomy. Cardiac testing typically includes an electrocardiogram and should include an echocardiogram to assess pulmonary artery pressures and left ventricular function, as these patients are at increased risk for cor pulmonale. Right-sided cardiac catheterization is usually performed in patients with elevated pulmonary artery pressures by echocardiogram or clinical evidence of cor pulmonale.

Intravenous agents are typically used for induction of anesthesia, as severe bullous disease may make the uptake and distribution of inhalational agents unpredictable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Short-acting rather than longer-acting anesthetic agents are used to enable early extubation. A thoracic epidural catheter is usually placed for administration of epidural anesthetic agents during <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> after surgery whether the procedure is performed via thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopy.

Once the bulla has been excised, the clamp or bronchial blocker is removed from that side of the endotracheal tube, and mechanical ventilation is resumed to the deflated lung. A gradual reinflation is preferred to aggressive efforts at reinflation. The technique of one lung ventilation for lung resectional surgery is discussed separately.

For the rare single bulla that is well-demarcated and has a clear, narrow pedicle, a simple stapled excision is typically performed. When the bulla is broad based or when numerous bullae are in close proximity and merge indistinctly, a broad stapled wedge resection is usually necessary.</p><p>Lobectomy and segmentectomy (resection of an anatomic lung segment) are used less commonly, as they generally involve resection of a greater amount of lung tissue and are associated with less favorable outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/3,6,8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,8,18</a>]. However, when a lobe is nearly completely replaced by bullous disease and the lobar fissures are well-formed, a lobectomy may be performed rather than a simple bullectomy to reduce the likelihood and severity of postoperative air leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1371846\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ablation or excision of giant bulla(e) is most commonly achieved by stapler excision, but can also be achieved by other surgical methods, such as plication and laser or talc ablation. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Staple excision</strong> &ndash; The most common method excises the bulla using an automatic stapler, which may or may not be buttressed with material (natural, synthetic) to help reduce the incidence of air leak. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Strategies to reduce air leak'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The initial step is to compress the lung along the line of the proposed incision, using a standard lung clamp or similar instrument [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. After compression of the lung, an automatic stapler is advanced and fired, dividing the tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plication</strong> &ndash; Plication involves sewing tucks or folds into the bulla to obliterate the air space and is occasionally used for bullae that are on a narrow pedicle of lung tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ablation techniques</strong> &ndash; Investigational techniques to ablate a giant bulla via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) have included the use of laser, radiofrequency energy, and other methods to destroy or shrink the bullae.

Radiofrequency coagulation enabled gradual reduction in the size of the bulla and clear delineation of the border between the bulla and underlying lung. Further study of this technique is needed before widespread adoption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Modified Monaldi procedure</strong> &ndash; The modified Monaldi procedure, or the Brompton technique, consists of a limited thoracotomy to visualize the bulla, insufflation of the bulla with iodized talc, and drainage of the bulla for several days with a Foley catheter under water seal to collapse the bulla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/7,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,32,33</a>]. Talc is also instilled into the pleural cavity to achieve pleurodesis.

Several techniques have been developed to reduce postoperative air leak. These techniques include buttressing the staple line with natural or synthetic materials, applying fibrin sealant (also known as fibrin &quot;glue&quot;) to areas of air leak intraoperatively, and creating a &quot;pleural tent&quot;.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When stapler excision of a bulla is performed, the staple line may be buttressed with bovine pericardial strips <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other materials (eg, polytetrafluoroethylene strips) to reduce the incidence of postoperative air leaks. Buttressing is particularly important when the underlying lung is fragile and emphysematous. In a randomized trial of 1414 patients undergoing bullectomy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax, staple line coverage with absorbable cellulose mesh and fibrin glue was compared with mechanical abrasion of the parietal pleura; no difference was noted in the proportion of patients experiencing air leakage &gt;5 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Whether this applies to giant bullectomy is unclear. A cohort series of nine patients undergoing VATS bullectomy and mechanical pleurodesis noted a prolonged air leak in only one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with visible air leakage after resection of a giant bulla, application of fibrin sealant to the staple line may reduce the severity of the air leak, although data assessing this technique are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

To create a pleural tent, the parietal pleura is dissected free from the chest wall and tailored to make a tent (or cap) to cover the divided surface of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative management entails careful attention to respiratory status and pain control, treatment of bronchoconstriction, monitoring for development or worsening of a pneumothorax, and prevention of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

If these factors are all acceptable, the patient can be extubated. The majority of patients are extubated in the operating room to minimize the duration of positive pressure ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>Nebulized bronchodilator therapy is administered every four to six hours, but may be increased to every one to two hours for patients with increased cough, wheeze, or dyspnea. Nebulizer treatments are continued for 24 to 48 hours and then transitioned back to the patient's usual regimen.

Brief kinking or blockage of a chest tube can lead to rapid accumulation of a pneumothorax and cardiopulmonary decompensation. A chest radiograph is obtained daily to confirm full lung re-expansion. Chest tubes are generally left in place until the lung is fully re-expanded, and there is no evidence of air leak. However, some patients with slow air leaks may be transitioned to a minichest tube with a unidirectional flutter valve (ie, Heimlich valve) to enable discharge prior to complete resolution of the air leak. The procedure for chest tube removal is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Management of postoperative pain usually involves a combination of regional and systemic agents to enable early mobilization of the patient and effective cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bullectomy-for-giant-bullae/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The patient's values and preferences should be used to guide the decision. Patients who highly value a potential reduction in dyspnea and are willing to accept the risk of perioperative mortality may choose bullectomy over medical management, whereas others may not wish to accept the risk of perioperative mortality.

For patients with minimal surrounding diffuse emphysema, a bullectomy is typically performed at the time of pleurodesis.
