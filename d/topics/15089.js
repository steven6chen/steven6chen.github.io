This can lead to serious problems in the body, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney damage &ndash; Normally, the kidneys filter the blood and remove waste and excess salt and water (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). Severe kidney damage can lead to &quot;acute kidney failure,&quot; which is when the kidneys stop working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having the right amount of certain salts in the blood &ndash; The body needs the correct amount of certain salts (for example, potassium) to work normally. Having levels of these substances that are too high or too low can cause problems.</p><p/><p>Rhabdomyolysis can be mild or severe. Severe rhabdomyolysis can be life-threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8801359\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes rhabdomyolysis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different things can cause muscle tissue to get damaged, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle injury, for example, from surgery or getting hurt</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very intense exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lying in the same position for a very long time, such as being in a coma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some kinds of infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some kinds of medicines or poisons</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle problems that some people are born with</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8801374\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of rhabdomyolysis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people have no symptoms. They might find out they have it when their doctor does blood tests for another reason.</p><p>Other people have symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine that is red or brown</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle weakness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8801389\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Call your doctor or nurse if you have the above symptoms, especially after getting hurt or exercising very hard.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8801404\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for rhabdomyolysis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can do blood tests and urine tests to check for rhabdomyolysis and any problems it has caused.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8801419\"><span class=\"h1\">How is rhabdomyolysis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on what's causing your rhabdomyolysis and how severe your condition is. Most people are treated in the hospital.</p><p>Your doctor will treat the cause of your rhabdomyolysis, if it can be treated.</p><p>He or she will also treat any problems that the rhabdomyolysis has caused. Treating these problems usually involves:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids that go into your vein through a thin tube, called an &quot;IV&quot; &ndash; Fluids can help the body flush out the substances from the muscle cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to correct the salt levels in your body</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment to help until your kidneys work normally again &ndash; This can include medicines, diet changes, or &quot;renal replacement therapy.&quot; Renal replacement therapy is a term for treatments that take over the job of the kidneys. It involves either:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemodialysis &ndash; Hemodialysis is a procedure in which a machine takes over the job of the kidneys. The machine pumps blood out of the body, filters it, and returns it to the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56992\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56992 \">figure 2</a>). People have hemodialysis at least 3 times a week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peritoneal dialysis &ndash; Peritoneal dialysis is a procedure that people do at home every day. It involves piping a special fluid into the belly. This fluid collects waste and excess salt and water from the blood. Then the used fluid drains out of the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71539 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p>Some people with rhabdomyolysis have an abnormal build-up of pressure in a group of muscles. Although this is uncommon, it is an emergency. It usually needs to be treated with surgery to cut open the muscles and relieve the pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8801433\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-kidney-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute kidney injury (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peritoneal dialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute compartment syndrome (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
