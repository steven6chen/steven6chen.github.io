Subsequent animal studies, observational studies, and clinical trials have examined the health effects of seafood consumption and identified the long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) in fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) as the likely active constituents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58051\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58051 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/2-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-22</a>].</p><p>DHA also appears to be essential for early brain development during gestation and infancy.

From the liver, EPA and DHA are released into the circulation as triglycerides in lipoprotein particles (such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]) and as plasma phospholipids. Smaller amounts circulate as free fatty acids, largely bound to albumin.</p><p>EPA and DHA are incorporated into cell membrane phospholipids throughout the body, particularly in the heart and brain, and stored in adipose tissue as triglycerides. Consumption of fish oil increases the concentration of EPA and DHA in plasma lipids and membrane phospholipids within days, with maximal incorporation at about two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Increases are dose-dependent but nonlinear, with a larger increase at lower doses and then smaller increments with increasing doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Following cessation of consumption, washout occurs within one to three days in plasma lipid fractions but takes much longer (one to two months) for cell membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Relatively minor pharmacokinetic differences are seen between different oral formulations of fish oil (eg, triglycerides versus ethyl esters) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Compared with EPA and DHA, other n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) such as docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-3) are present in much smaller amounts in fish oil but may be biologically active and have important metabolites following consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. EPA can also be metabolized to prostaglandin E3, an eicosanoid that mediates inflammation and thrombosis. Very little EPA (&lt;5 percent) is converted to DHA, although this conversion occurs to a greater extent in women, particularly during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>For most health effects, the relative biologic importance of EPA versus DHA versus their associated metabolites is not well-established, except for early brain development for which DHA appears to be more important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fish oil influences several cardiovascular risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F107606\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107606 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Generally speaking, the physiologic effects of fish oil occur within weeks of habitual consumption and may result from altered cell membrane fluidity and function that modulate protein receptor responses following incorporation of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) into cell membranes; binding of n-3 PUFA to cytoplasmic lipid-binding proteins (eg, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [PPAR]-gamma) that regulate gene transcription; direct interaction and influence of n-3 PUFA on membrane channels and proteins, such as G-protein-coupled receptors; and production of n-3 PUFA metabolites such as eicosanoids and specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) including resolvins or protectins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F107607\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107607 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>These physiologic effects appear to have varying dose-responses and time-responses of effect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78417 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. At typical dietary intakes, antiarrhythmic effects predominate, and such effects may reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death and coronary heart disease (CHD) death within weeks. At higher doses, maximum antiarrhythmic effects have been achieved, but other physiologic effects may begin to modestly impact other clinical outcomes, although some of these physiologic effects (such as triglyceride lowering) may require months to years of consumption before lower risk of clinical outcomes is seen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood lipids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fish oil consumption lowers serum triglyceride concentrations by 25 to 30 percent, an effect within the range of efficacy of other triglyceride-lowering drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. The potential cellular mechanisms for this effect have been previously reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The dose-response appears to be fairly linear. Little triglyceride lowering is seen with dietary doses or low-dose (&lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> supplementation, whereas higher doses (3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> appreciably lower triglyceride levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78417 \">figure 4</a>). A meta-analysis of 55 placebo-controlled trials found that each 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> increase in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduced triglycerides by 5.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.07 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The effect was stronger when baseline triglyceride levels were higher; above the median triglyceride level of 83 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.94 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> each 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> EPA+DHA reduced triglycerides by 8.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.09 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p>However, the fish oil doses required to lower triglycerides are several-fold higher than the doses that may reduce coronary mortality (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'CHD death and sudden cardiac death'</a> below). Additionally, while Mendelian randomization (genetic) studies suggest that triglyceride-rich particles are causally related to CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], the clinical benefits of lowering elevated plasma triglyceride levels, by any pharmacologic means, have not yet been convincingly demonstrated. Thus, triglyceride lowering per se is unlikely to account for benefits of low-dose fish oil (approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> or less) for reducing CHD death, but such effects may contribute over time to modest risk reductions in other clinical outcomes (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertriglyceridemia#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertriglyceridemia&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Fish oil supplementation also modestly raises high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations (+3 percent) and, particularly in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, raises low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations (+5 percent) and lowers the proportion of small dense LDL-C particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. This increase in LDL particle size may in part account for the higher LDL-C concentrations; that is, LDL-C concentration may slightly increase but without appreciable change in the number of circulating LDL particles (apolipoprotein B concentration). Given the frequently coexisting relationship of high triglycerides, low HDL-C, and small dense LDL particles in many individuals, the effects of fish oil to lower triglycerides, raise HDL-C, and decrease the proportions of small dense LDL particles appear concordant.

BP was reduced in both normotensive and hypertensive patients. The largest effects were seen in those with untreated hypertension, with systolic and diastolic BP reductions of 4.51 and 3.05 mmHg, respectively.</p><p>Animal studies and observational studies in humans indicate that the BP-lowering effect of fish oil results from a reduction in systemic vascular resistance (ie, lower arteriolar resistance), with unchanged cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In vitro studies demonstrate that n-3 PUFA induce nitric oxide production, modulate endothelial activation, and modify the location and function of cell membrane caveolae proteins including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>].</p><p>In short-term trials in humans, fish oil consumption increases biomarkers of nitric oxide production, mitigates peripheral vasoconstrictive responses to norepinephrine and angiotensin II, improves arterial wall compliance, and enhances vasodilatory responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>]. These effects, separately or in sum, could account for lowering of systemic vascular resistance.</p><p>In summary, the evidence indicates that fish oil consumption lowers systolic and diastolic BP, including clinically meaningful reductions in those with hypertension, due to reductions in systemic vascular resistance.

Experimental studies in isolated rat myocytes, exercising dogs, and nonhuman primates confirm that fish oil lowers resting HR and suggest that this could result from direct cardiac electrophysiologic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/19,20,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,54</a>].

Experimental trials evaluating fish oil and HRV have been inconsistent possibly due to small numbers, variable doses of fish oil used, relatively short durations of intake (weeks to months), or limited periods of HRV assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/55,63-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,63-71</a>].</p><p>However, a study of patients undergoing coronary angiography found that tissue EPA and DHA levels were correlated with HRV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], and a population-based study found that increased dietary consumption of EPA and DHA was associated with favorable effects on HRV even after adjusting for resting HR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H417239933\"><span class=\"h2\">Endothelial function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several, though not all, randomized trials in humans have demonstrated that fish oil consumption also lowers circulating markers of endothelial dysfunction, such as E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/72,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,74</a>]. A meta-analysis of 16 randomized, placebo-controlled trials including 901 participants demonstrated that, compared with placebo, fish oil increased flow-mediated vasodilation, a noninvasive measure of nitric oxide dependent on endothelial function; these trials used a variety of doses (range: 0.45 to 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> over a median treatment duration of 56 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac relaxation, filling, and efficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left ventricular diastolic filling consists of two phases: an early phase of active (energy-dependent) relaxation and a second phase of more passive (compliance-dependent) filling (with a final brief phase due to atrial contraction).

The relationships of n-3 PUFA consumption with risk of CHD death or sudden cardiac death in both observational studies and clinical trials (reviewed below), together with documented effects of n-3 PUFA on heart rate (and likely also heart rate variability), suggest that fish oil has effects on cardiac electrophysiology that, either directly or indirectly, may reduce the risk of acute ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias, (eg, in the setting of acute MI).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Insulin sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In meta-analyses of randomized trials, n-3 PUFA do not appear to have major effects on biomarkers of glucose metabolism or insulin sensitivity in patients with or without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>].</p><p>In meta-analysis of 18 prospective cohort studies including 540,184 participants and 25,670 cases of incident type 2 diabetes, neither fish or seafood consumption or estimated intake of EPA+DHA were significantly associated with incidence of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

Findings have been broadly consistent, with benefits for cardiac death but not total CHD or total cardiovascular events.

It is also possible that many of the more recent trials were simply underpowered to confirm benefits for CHD death. As noted above, a meta-analysis of all controlled trials prior to the Risk and Prevention Study, including a total of 3993 cardiac deaths, found a significant reduction in cardiac deaths with fish oil supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. Addition to this meta-analysis of the Risk and Prevention Study (with only 158 cardiac deaths) would be very unlikely to alter these results.</p><p>Additional large trials with long-term follow-up are needed to clarify whether omega-3 fatty acid supplementation might have different effects on cardiac mortality depending on whether patients are also receiving aggressive treatment for primary or secondary prevention of CHD. While awaiting such trials, patients at high risk for CHD death should receive multiple lifestyle interventions and, among these, it seems very reasonable to include recommendations to eat fish (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;, section on 'Lifestyle modification'</a>).

In other words, in given populations, the magnitude of reduction in total mortality appears to correspond to an approximately one-third reduction in the proportion of all deaths due to <span class=\"nowrap\">CHD/sudden</span> cardiac death in that population. Most of the trials in the meta-analysis were performed in subjects with known CHD or at high risk for CHD, in whom approximately half of all deaths would be attributable to CHD or sudden cardiac death. Thus, a proportionally smaller effect of n-3 PUFA consumption on total mortality would be anticipated in populations having a lower proportion of total deaths attributable to CHD, eg, in the general population of middle-aged adults (in whom approximately one-quarter of deaths would be due to CHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].</p><p>Consistent with this, a cohort study involving 2692 older adults from four counties in the United States that had 16 years of follow-up found an association between total n-3 PUFA levels measured at baseline and total mortality (HR comparing the highest and lowest quintiles 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.86) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>].

There was, however, significant heterogeneity between trials. Additionally, the confidence interval around the relative risk is broad and includes both potential increases and decreases in recurrent tachyarrhythmia that might be clinically important if real, suggesting that further trials are needed. A second meta-analysis found similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].</p><p>The pathoetiology of recurrent (ectopic or reentrant) ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with ICDs, a small minority of patients, is likely to be different from the pathoetiology of first-onset (often ischemia-induced) ventricular fibrillation that causes CHD death and sudden cardiac death in the general population and in the great majority of patients with established CHD. Thus, it is uncertain whether the results of trials in patients with ICDs have direct relevance to the effects of n-3 PUFA on cardiac death in generally healthy individuals and those with established CHD.

A 2013 meta-analysis of randomized trials that included this large trial also found no statistically-significant reduction in postoperative AF, despite some evidence of publication bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]. A second 2013 meta-analysis also found evidence of publication bias and concluded that there was substantial heterogeneity across trials (I<sup>2</sup> = 52%) that could be explained by two small open-label trials that had found large beneficial effects; the pooled estimate from blinded trials did not show a statistically significant reduction in postoperative AF with fish oil supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>].

After a median follow-up of 3.9 years, fewer patients treated with n-3 PUFA died (27 versus 29 percent, HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-1.00); significant improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction were also seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Approximately 30 percent of patients discontinued both n-3 PUFA and placebo. As in other studies, a large number of the prevented deaths appear to have been CHD deaths and sudden cardiac deaths. However, the time until benefit was longer in this trial than in trials where fish oil had been used after an acute coronary syndrome (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'CHD death and sudden cardiac death'</a> above).

Different fish oil formulations contain variable amounts of EPA and DHA (between 20 and, with Lovaza, 85 percent; Vascepa is more than 95 percent icosapent-ethyl, the ethyl ester of EPA), with the remainder typically comprised of other n-3 PUFA, monounsaturated fats, saturated fats, and gelatin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/174,176\" class=\"abstract_t\">174,176</a>].

Given potential uncertainties inherent in such calculations and the absence of any significant adverse effects of fish oil at these or much higher doses, a reasonable target intake to prevent CHD death and sudden cardiac death would be 250 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of EPA+DHA.

Consistent with this, findings from one randomized trial indicate that adding n-3 PUFA to even the very high background dietary fish consumption seen in Japan reduces nonfatal coronary events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].</p><p>Because the current evidence is insufficient to conclude that consumption of either EPA or DHA alone is adequate to provide all cardiovascular benefits, consumption of both EPA and DHA is preferable (and no specific ratio or combination of EPA and DHA is supported by current evidence).</p><p>Compared with supplements, consumption of fish and other seafood also provides potentially beneficial protein, vitamins, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].
