Pimples happen when pores get clogged with dead skin and oil, and bacteria build up. Then the skin gets inflamed and can turn red or swell (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70916 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22661696\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to reduce acne?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The way you take care of your skin has a big effect on your acne. Here's what you should do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your face no more than twice a day. Use warm &ndash; not hot &ndash; water, and do not use harsh soaps. Instead, use a gentle non-soap facial skin cleanser. Do not scrub your face, because that can make acne worse and damage the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not pick or squeeze pimples. This can make acne worse and damage the skin. Plus it can lead to infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid oil-based make-up and skin products. They can make acne worse. If you use a moisturizer for your face, a moisturizer labeled as &quot;non-comedogenic&quot; is often best.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22661703\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I treat my own acne?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have mild acne, you can try non-prescription acne products. You might even try using more than 1 product at once. That might be more effective than using 1 single product alone. In rare cases, people have a severe allergic reaction to acne products, so for the first 3 days, try them on just a small area. If you do not improve after 3 months, or if you have moderate or severe acne, ask your doctor or nurse for advice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22661710\"><span class=\"h1\">How is acne treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can treat acne using different types of medicines. Sometimes doctors suggest trying more than 1 medicine at once.</p><p>There is no 1 medicine or combination of medicines that works best for everyone. Instead, people often need to try different medicines until they find what works best for them.</p><p>Most acne medicines require a prescription. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Retinoids</strong> &ndash; Retinoids are medicines that help keep your pores unclogged. Most retinoids are available in a gel or cream that you put on your skin. Examples of prescription retinoids include tretinoin (brand name: Retin-A), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adapalene-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">adapalene</a> (brand name: Differin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tazarotene-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tazarotene</a> (brand name: Tazorac). One form of adapalene gel can also be bought without a prescription. These medicines can also help improve dark spots on the skin caused by acne.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Products that help skin shed</strong> &ndash; Products such salicylic acid and glycolic acid help remove dead layers of skin. They can reduce acne by helping to unclog pores.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antibiotics you put on the skin</strong> &ndash; Antibiotics reduce acne by killing the bacteria inside pimples. They also help bring down inflammation. These medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">erythromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">clindamycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">dapsone</a> (brand name: Aczone), and others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azelaic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Azelaic acid</a> <strong>&ndash;</strong> Azelaic acid helps keep pores unclogged and can kill bacteria in pimples. Azelaic acid can also help to improve dark spots on the skin caused by acne.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoyl-peroxide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Benzoyl peroxide</a> &ndash; Benzoyl peroxide kills bacteria and helps to unclog pores. Benzoyl peroxide is also available without a prescription.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antibiotics you take in a pill</strong> &ndash; Antibiotic pills work for the same reasons antibiotic gels or lotions work. But they tend to be stronger and can cause unpleasant side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Birth control pills</strong> &ndash; Some of the skin reactions that lead to acne are controlled by hormones. For this reason, birth control pills can sometimes help with acne.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Isotretinoin</a><strong> pills</strong> (sample brand names: Amnesteem, Absorica, Claravis, Sotret) &ndash; One of the retinoid medicines comes in pill form. This medicine, called isotretinoin, is very effective against severe acne. But it can also cause serious side effects and birth defects. Women who want to take isotretinoin must follow very strict safety rules to avoid pregnancy. (This medicine used to be sold under the brand name Accutane, but that brand name is no longer available in the US.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22661717\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor before you start trying to get pregnant. Many of the medicines used to treat acne are not safe for a growing baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22661724\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my diet affect my acne?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have found that acne seems to be more common in people who drink a lot of milk. But more research is needed to understand the link between the types of foods people eat and acne.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22661773\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acne-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acne (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
