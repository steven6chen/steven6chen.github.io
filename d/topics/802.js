They can originate from the pancreas, duodenum, distal common bile duct (CBD), or the structures of the ampullary (ampulla of Vater) complex. The ampulla of Vater is formed by the duodenal aspect of the sphincter of Oddi muscle, which surrounds the confluence of the distal CBD and main pancreatic duct, as well as the papilla of Vater, a mucosal papillary mound at the distal insertion of these ducts on the medial wall of the duodenum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78786 \">figure 1</a>). Ampullary carcinomas are defined as those that arise within the ampullary complex, distal to the bifurcation of the distal CBD and the pancreatic duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53240\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53240 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The papilla is a nipple-like structure on the medial aspect of the second portion of the duodenum best visualized with a side-viewing endoscope. The distal bile and ventral pancreatic ducts traverse the duodenal wall in this location and open into the duodenal lumen through the small mucosal elevation of the papilla of Vater.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of ampullary carcinoma will be reviewed here. Treatment of ampullary cancers and the approach to the patient with ampullary adenoma are presented separately.

Despite this, primary ampullary tumors are rare, with an incidence of approximately four to six cases per million population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. They account for only 6 percent of lesions that arise in the periampullary region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] but are responsible for 20 percent of all tumor-related obstructions of the common bile duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There is some evidence that the incidence has increased over the last 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Both benign and malignant ampullary tumors can occur sporadically or in the setting of a genetic syndrome. The incidence of ampullary tumors is increased 200- to 300-fold among patients with hereditary polyposis syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Surveillance endoscopy is particularly important to detect early ampullary lesions in patients with FAP given the high incidence of coexisting premalignant duodenal adenomatous polyps. Up to 90 percent of patients with FAP develop adenomas in the upper gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In contrast, patients whose ampullary carcinomas arise in the setting of an inherited polyposis syndrome usually present at an earlier age, due in part to endoscopic screening and surveillance programs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several lines of evidence suggest that the biology of primary ampullary adenomas and carcinomas is more analogous to intestinal rather than pancreaticobiliary neoplasms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The histology of primary ampullary neoplasms more often resembles that of adenomas and adenocarcinomas of intestinal origin rather than pancreaticobiliary origin. In one study of 170 ampullary carcinomas, the most common histologic subtype was intestinal (47 percent), followed by pancreatobiliary (24 percent), poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (13 percent), intestinal-mucinous (8 percent), and invasive papillary (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ampullary carcinomas are thought to arise from ampullary adenomas, a premalignant precursor lesion displaying the adenoma-carcinoma sequence observed in colorectal neoplasia. Moreover, patients with FAP have a significantly increased incidence of both ampullary and colorectal cancers relative to the general population, suggesting that the mechanisms of ampullary and colorectal carcinogenesis may be similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>K-ras mutations are an early event in ampullary carcinogenesis, with an incidence (37 percent) that is similar to that in colon cancer (up to 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Of ampullary carcinomas classified as having an intestinal origin, 95 percent had high COX-2 expression, whereas only 50 percent of lesions with a pancreaticobiliary origin demonstrated high COX-2 expression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True ampullary cancers have a better prognosis than periampullary malignancies of pancreatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>] or extrahepatic biliary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] origin. Resectability rates are higher (over 90 percent in some contemporary series), and five-year survival rates are approximately 30 to 50 percent, even in patients with lymph node involvement. In contrast, fewer than 10 percent of patients with completely resected, node-positive pancreatic cancer are alive at two years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgery in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic cancer and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ampullary carcinoma: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Subdividing adenocarcinomas of the ampulla of Vater according to histologic subtype and immunohistochemical staining pattern into distinct subsets with differing biologic behavior has prognostic importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In a retrospective study of 208 patients treated for ampullary adenocarcinoma in Sydney, Australia, those with a histomolecular pancreaticobiliary phenotype (CDX-negative, MUC1 positive) had a significantly worse outcome than did those with an intestinal phenotype (CDX-positive, MUC1-negative), with median survival of 16 versus 116 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. When histomolecular phenotype was combined with the lymph node status, three subsets of ampullary adenocarcinomas emerged with significantly different survival outcomes: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a node-negative, non-pancreaticobiliary histomolecular phenotype tumor had an excellent prognosis (five-year survival 88 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a node-positive pancreaticobiliary phenotype had a poor prognosis (five-year survival 20 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The remaining patients (node-positive non-pancreaticobiliary phenotype, node-negative pancreaticobiliary phenotype) had an intermediate prognosis (five-year survival 47 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The results were comparable in two additional independent cohorts of 90 patients from Glasgow, Scotland, and 46 from Verona, Italy. However, others have failed to find a significant overall survival difference between the intestinal and pancreaticobiliary subtypes of ampullary cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Given the conflicting data, the most recent 2017 tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) did not include histomolecular phenotype as a component of its prognostic stage groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110872 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p>Identification of prognostically relevant subgroups has also been achieved by use of gene expression profiling in conjunction with immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratins 7 and 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, molecular techniques such as these are not yet ready for clinical application. </p><p>Whether and how this information could be used to individualize treatment decisions, particularly about adjuvant therapy, is unclear. The impact of adjuvant therapy on outcomes according to histomolecular phenotype could not be addressed in the study described above, since only a minority of patients (64 of 208) in all three cohorts received adjuvant chemotherapy, and it was not randomly assigned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A retrospective analysis of a prospective, randomized, cooperative group study exploring the role of adjuvant therapy in periampullary cancers found no significant improvement in the pancreaticobiliary type compared with the intestinal type of ampullary cancers when adjuvant therapy was compared with no adjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, prospective study of treatment selection based upon histomolecular phenotype is needed before conclusions can be drawn as to the clinical significance of histomolecular phenotype. At present, adjuvant therapy recommendations for patients with ampullary cancer follow guidelines established for pancreatic cancer rather than intestinal cancer.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampullary-adenomas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ampullary adenomas: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ampullary cancers are not usually suspected as a cause of obstructive jaundice because of their lower incidence relative to other periampullary malignancies. Additional symptoms may include diarrhea due to fat malabsorption (steatorrhea), mild weight loss, and fatigue.</p><p>Up to one-third of patients have chronic, frequently occult gastrointestinal blood loss with an associated microcytic anemia or heme-positive stools. Patients occasionally present with frank bleeding due to sloughing of the tumor, a condition exacerbated by the use of antiplatelet agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>. In one report, nonspecific symptoms included abdominal pain (45 percent), fever (45 percent), mild nausea, and dyspepsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Large lesions may produce gastric outlet obstruction associated with severe nausea and vomiting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of an ampullary carcinoma is established by a combination of endoscopic, radiologic, and histologic features. Accurate staging is essential for planning surgical treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">TNM staging system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly used staging system is the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system of the combined American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110872 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The current (eighth edition, 2017) version contains a number of significant changes compared with the seventh (2010) edition, including modified definitions of T1, 2, 3, and 4 disease, the redefining of N1 disease as one to three positive regional nodes, and the defining of a new category, N2, as four or more positive regional nodes.</p><p>In the absence of metastases, the prognosis of an ampullary carcinoma depends primarily upon two factors: the degree of local tumor invasion, as reflected by the T stage, and the presence of lymphatic spread, as reflected by the N stage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic evaluation of a jaundiced patient with a suspected malignant bile duct obstruction is designed to eliminate benign tumors or gallstones from the differential and to establish the extent of tumor invasion and spread. Although advanced endoscopic techniques can help to differentiate ampullary adenomas from carcinomas, it may be difficult to completely exclude a carcinoma without complete resection of the lesion. Ampullary adenomas have the potential to undergo malignant transformation, and an occult focus of carcinoma may be present within a predominantly benign adenoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampullary-adenomas-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ampullary adenomas: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A transabdominal ultrasound (US) is a reasonable first test in patients presenting with obstructive jaundice, but it will generally not show the tumor. Helical computed tomography (CT) scanning should be obtained to visualize the pancreas and surrounding structures. Although its spatial resolution is inadequate to determine the degree of local tumor invasion, it is the most useful test to exclude the presence of distant metastases. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Transabdominal ultrasonography'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal CT'</a> below.)</p><p>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the single most useful endoscopic study for diagnosing ampullary carcinoma because it permits identification of the tumor, biopsy, and decompression, if needed. While endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is as sensitive as ERCP and superior to CT and transabdominal US for detecting small ampullary tumors, it is typically not required for diagnosis. It may have a role in preoperative staging but may result in overstaging. As a result, we do not routinely employ EUS for the diagnosis and staging of ampullary carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)'</a> below.)</p><p>Differentiating a primary ampullary carcinoma from other more common periampullary malignancies (arising in the pancreas, duodenum, or bile duct) is challenging. Although the distinction may be evident after radiographic and endoscopic evaluation, it may not be possible to determine the tissue origin of a malignant periampullary neoplasm until resection and a histopathologic evaluation of the entire surgical specimen is completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This is particularly true if the lesion is large and obstructs the duodenal lumen. From a surgical standpoint, the distinction between ampullary and periampullary cancers is not essential preoperatively since the treatment is the same for both lesions. However, the oncologic implications and prognosis of ampullary and periampullary tumors are substantially different. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgery in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic cancer and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and staging of small bowel neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Adenocarcinoma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of localized cholangiocarcinoma: Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Distal cholangiocarcinoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Transabdominal ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transabdominal US should be the first imaging study ordered for patients with jaundice, since US can identify intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct dilatation and gallstones. However, overlying bowel gas frequently obscures the distal bile duct, ampulla, and pancreas. In one study, only 10 of 127 ampullary masses were detected by US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

A &quot;pancreatic mass protocol&quot; CT should be ordered. Specifically, patients should receive water as the oral &quot;contrast agent&quot; (to distend the duodenum and improve visualization of the duodenal lumen and adjacent pancreas), and intravenous contrast is injected as a bolus to permit both arterial- and venous-phase imaging. Images are acquired at 1 to 2.5 mm intervals to improve the sensitivity of pancreatic imaging.

However, ERCP cannot determine the extent of local tumor invasion of an ampullary carcinoma into the adjacent duodenum or pancreatic parenchyma, information that is essential for preoperative staging and surgical planning.</p><p>Most ampullary cancers are obvious endoscopically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70689\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70689 \">image 2</a>). If an exophytic ampullary tumor is identified that has the appearance of an adenoma, malignancy should be strongly suspected if the mass is ulcerated or over 3 cm in size. However, because the false negative rate of endoscopic biopsy is as high as 50 percent, a negative result is insufficient to exclude the presence of malignancy in an ampullary lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/36-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-41</a>].

Ampullary carcinomas appear as masses (filling defects) protruding into the duodenal lumen, with characteristic delayed enhancement and hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, PTC is an invasive procedure during which the biliary tree is accessed percutaneously using a needle inserted through the parenchyma of the liver into an intrahepatic bile duct then contrast opacified under fluoroscopy. PTC is most commonly performed when the biliary tree is dilated and ERCP has failed to cannulate or adequately demonstrate the biliary anatomy. PTC provides not only cholangiography but also the opportunity for brush cytology (although not forceps biopsy for histology) of radiographic strictures, although ampullary lesions that do not extend into the distal CBD may not be amenable to tissue acquisition via this route. Another limitation of PTC is that it cannot directly visualize ampullary lesions, duodenal tumor ingrowth, or involvement of the pancreatic duct.

In addition, EUS will not be helpful for identifying foci of carcinoma within otherwise benign lesions. EUS may be indicated for the occasional biopsy-negative ampullary lesion that has equivocal endoscopic features of malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampullary-adenomas-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ampullary adenomas: Management&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic papillectomy'</a>.)</p><p>If malignancy is suspected in a patient undergoing EUS, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the ampulla, papilla, and surrounding deeper structures, including local lymph nodes, can be obtained during the procedure. However, a negative result does not exclude the presence of a malignant focus within an adenoma.

EUS is less helpful for N staging.</p><p>EUS is capable of obtaining images of the distal biliary and pancreatic ducts, permitting assessment of local intraductal tumor extension. EUS also accurately demonstrates tumor penetration into the duodenum by demonstrating obliteration of the interface between the tumor and the muscularis propria of the duodenum (a feature that upstages the tumor to T2). Tumor extension into the pancreas constitutes T3 disease, while invasion beyond the pancreas signifies T4 disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72481\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72481 \">image 3</a>). </p><p>EUS is less accurate for N staging than it is for T staging. Ampullary cancers drain into two peripancreatic lymph node basins: the retroduodenopancreatic chain and the superior mesenteric chain. Regional lymph nodes also include the lymph nodes along the hepatic artery and portal vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. One study reported sensitivity and specificity of 67 and 96 percent, respectively, for EUS detection of nodal metastases when abnormal nodes were seen (defined as those over 1 cm in diameter and located in the above two positions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Another series found sensitivity and specificity rates of 69 and 38 percent, respectively, when all visualized lymph nodes present around the duodenopancreatic block were presumed to be metastatic, regardless of size or position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

The small caliber, flexibility, and excellent image quality produced by these catheters make them useful for evaluating a variety of biliary and pancreatic disorders. IDUS accurately visualizes the anatomy of the papilla and is the only procedure that reliably differentiates the sphincter of Oddi muscle from the remainder of the papilla. As a result, IDUS can be useful for diagnosing and assessing the size and extent of papillary tumors. In a study of 40 patients with ampullary neoplasms, 33 of whom had ampullary carcinoma, IDUS was more accurate than EUS for T staging and evaluating ductal invasion, making it useful in selecting cases that might be considered for endoscopic excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

Diagnosis and staging are achieved by a combination of endoscopic, radiologic, and histologic features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51015\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51015 \">algorithm 1</a>). There are two major considerations: identification of the tumor, and distinction from an ampullary adenoma or tumor arising from outside of the ampulla (mainly pancreatic carcinoma or a distal cholangiocarcinoma).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A transabdominal ultrasound (US) is a reasonable first test in patients presenting with obstructive jaundice, but it will generally not show the tumor. Helical computed tomography (CT) scanning should be obtained to visualize the pancreas and surrounding structures. Although its spatial resolution is inadequate to determine the degree of local tumor invasion, it is the most useful test to exclude the presence of distant metastases. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Transabdominal ultrasonography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal CT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the single most useful endoscopic study since it permits identification of the tumor, biopsy, and decompression, if needed. While endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is as sensitive as ERCP and superior to CT and transabdominal US for detecting small ampullary tumors, it is typically not required for diagnosis. It may have a role in preoperative staging but may result in overstaging. As a result, we do not routinely employ EUS for the diagnosis and staging of ampullary carcinoma.
