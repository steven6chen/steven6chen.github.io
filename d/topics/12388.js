Along with fractures of the carpal bones, they represent a substantial portion of upper extremity fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-finger-hand-and-wrist-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The distal phalanx is the most commonly fractured bone in the hand, followed by the metacarpals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-finger-hand-and-wrist-fractures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The bones of the hand and wrist are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51990\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51990 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Metacarpal fractures are seen more often in adults, whereas phalangeal fractures are more common in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-finger-hand-and-wrist-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of metacarpal and phalangeal fractures are intra-articular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-finger-hand-and-wrist-fractures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10043286\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before examining a hand fracture, a quick assessment to rule out any other associated injuries should be carried out. For patients without apparent life-threatening injuries who appear appropriate for office management, assessment begins with a focused history. Analgesia is sometimes needed before a history can be obtained.</p><p>A focused history should be obtained that includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hand dominance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occupation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanism of injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time since injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place of injury</p><p/><p>Details of the mechanism of injury and an understanding of the injury patterns associated with particular mechanisms are important. Injuries sustained from trauma involving significant force are associated with greater displacement and a larger area of potential injury. Injury patterns guide the examination and choice of radiologic studies. Often, they help the clinician to consider less obvious associated injuries to bones, ligaments, or tendons. As an example, falling onto an outstretched hand is most often associated with a distal radius fracture, but may also cause an occult metacarpal or scaphoid fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-radius-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal radius fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scaphoid-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scaphoid fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-diagnosis-and-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Diagnosis and assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-forearm-fractures-in-children-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal forearm fractures in children: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The time elapsed since injury is important to consider when assessing open fractures and fractures associated with vascular injuries, as this may determine the need for emergency surgery. The location where the injury occurred helps to determine the risk for contamination. As an example, an open fracture sustained in a farming accident is more likely to be contaminated and require early and thorough debridement before definitive fixation can be considered.</p><p>The hand and wrist are examined for swelling, deformity, open wounds, alignment of the fingers, neurovascular status, and local tenderness. Palpate the entire area around the fracture site to exclude adjacent injuries. This includes the entire bone in question, adjacent bones, and at least one joint above and below the injury site. The neurovascular examination includes palpating distal pulses and testing sensation, including two-point discrimination, distal to the fracture site. Avoid testing range of motion or moving the affected area or limb until the radiologic assessment is completed in order to prevent exacerbating fracture displacement, soft tissue damage, or neurovascular compromise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-acute-fracture-management#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of acute fracture management&quot;, section on 'Initial clinical assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929825\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Secondary evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>It is important to assess rotatory displacement clinically because this is difficult to determine on radiograph. Rotatory displacement of phalangeal and metacarpal fractures is assessed by asking the patient to flex their fingers and observing the resulting orientation. Normally, all fingers are directed toward the scaphoid and there is no overlap or rotation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56239%7ESURG%2F69061\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56239 graphicRef69061 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p>Occasionally, the patient may be unable to flex their fingers due to pain and swelling, making it difficult to assess rotational displacement. In such cases, one can look at the fingertips end-on to observe the orientation of the nails. Typically, the nails of the fingers lie in the same transverse axis. Any change in orientation of the nail of one finger relative to the adjacent fingers suggests rotational displacement. In uncooperative patients and small children, pressure on the forearm flexor muscles will result in flexion of the digits and any rotational malalignment will become apparent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28605137\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A radiograph of the injured part of the hand should be obtained. The type of radiograph depends on the clinical assessment and suspected injuries, based on the physical examination and mechanism of injury. Consultation with a radiologist is often helpful.

Tuft fractures refer specifically to fractures involving the head of the distal phalanx.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The anatomical sites of scaphoid fracture are the tubercle, waist, proximal pole, and distal pole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51297\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51297 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intra-articular fractures refer to fractures involving the joint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Geometry</strong> &ndash; Fracture geometry refers to the orientation of the fracture to the long axis of the bone. Fractures may be oriented in one or a combination of the following ways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61031\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61031 \">figure 4</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Transverse &ndash; perpendicular to long axis of bone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Short long oblique &ndash; tangential to long axis of bone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spiral &ndash; tangential and spiraling around the shaft</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Longitudinal &ndash; parallel to long axis of bone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Comminution</strong> &ndash; A simple fracture has two fractured fragments, whereas a comminuted fracture has more than two fragments.

An overlying wound may not in fact communicate with the fracture, but it is better to treat all such fractures as open fractures and let the treating hand surgeon make the final decisions about management.</p><p>The presence of a communicating wound implies that the fracture is contaminated. In order to prevent bacterial colonization of the fractured bone and subsequent infection, it is advisable to immediately remove any gross contaminants, gently irrigate the wound with isotonic saline solution, place clean moist gauze on the wound and cover it with an impermeable dressing, and administer prophylactic antibiotics as indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-finger-hand-and-wrist-fractures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of osteomyelitis following trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial fracture management'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with open fractures should be referred to a hand surgeon immediately and should receive treatment within four to six hours. Prophylactic antibiotics should be administered parenterally within six hours after open trauma to reduce the risk of soft tissue infection or osteomyelitis. Initial empiric parenteral antibiotic therapy should be directed against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. For patients at risk for methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA), prophylactic antibiotics should include an agent with activity against MRSA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53504 \">table 1</a>). Prophylactic antibiotics should be administered for 48 to 72 hours total or for 24 hours after wound closure. Antibiotic selection is described in detail separately.

In general, nondisplaced fractures can be managed conservatively with appropriate splinting to immobilize the involved bone(s) until healing occurs. A simple splint typically restricts motion one joint above and one joint below the fractured bone(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-finger-hand-and-wrist-fractures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients who have a closed nondisplaced fracture should have the fracture placed in a splint and be scheduled for follow-up with a hand surgeon in approximately 7 to 10 days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74349 \">table 2</a>). Often, minor degrees of displacement can be managed nonoperatively, but evaluation by a hand surgeon is needed within 7 to 10 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H764751054\"><span class=\"h2\">Displaced fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Displacement of fracture fragments can cause shortening, angulation, translation and rotation of the involved bone(s). The degree of displacement depends upon the force of the initial injury and the quality of the bone (osteoporotic), and determines the need for intervention. All closed fractures with clinically significant displacement require preliminary reduction and splinting to stabilize the fracture prior to any operative repair. In general, any degree of rotational displacement is unacceptable. (See <a href=\"#H1836879\" class=\"local\">'Fracture reduction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1836879\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A reduction under appropriate anesthesia (local or regional) should be attempted upon diagnosis for most closed displaced hand fractures. If the fracture is reduced, a splint is applied and radiographs obtained to determine if the reduction has been maintained. If the fracture cannot be reduced (due to soft tissue interposition, ligamentous avulsion, or severe comminution) or the reduction cannot be maintained, the patient requires early surgical consultation (ie, within two to three days). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-acute-fracture-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of acute fracture management&quot;, section on 'Immobilization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1836921\"><span class=\"h2\">Stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fracture is considered clinically stable if it is nondisplaced or if the displacement can be reduced and the reduction maintained with a simple splint. Typically, stable fractures allow at least 50 percent of active range of motion at the adjacent joints without pain or displacement of the fracture. A displaced fracture that cannot be reduced or whose reduction cannot be maintained with a simple splint is termed an unstable fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-finger-hand-and-wrist-fractures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>In general, it is possible to predict fracture stability based on three main factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deforming forces acting on the fracture site</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fracture location, geometry, and comminution</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condition of the surrounding soft-tissue envelope</p><p/><p>Certain fracture patterns are intrinsically unstable and it is generally not worthwhile attempting reduction of these fractures in the emergency department or clinic, assuming the distal extremity is neurovascularly intact. Patients with unstable fractures should be evaluated by a hand surgeon within two to three days of injury, whereas patients with closed stable fractures can be evaluated within approximately 7 to 10 days. In the intervening period, the hand is splinted and appropriate analgesics are prescribed. For any fracture, the patient is advised to keep the limb elevated above heart level if possible to reduce swelling and pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10043308\"><span class=\"h2\">Splinting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splinting plays a major role in the management of musculoskeletal injuries, particularly those involving extremity fractures and joint dislocations. Immobilization of the extremity through splinting decreases pain and bleeding and prevents further soft tissue, vascular, or neurologic compromise.</p><p>In contrast to casts, splints accommodate some degree of swelling and may prevent neurovascular compromise. Considerations in splinting hand injuries include the joints to be immobilized, position of limb for splinting, splint location, and duration of splinting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries&quot;, section on 'Basic techniques'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28605491\"><span class=\"h3\">Splint placement and position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to place the splint on the appropriate side of the hand (palmar or dorsal) to counteract deforming forces and maintain reduction. As an example, a fracture with an apex dorsal angulation deformity should have the splint placed on the dorsal side, whereas a fracture with an apex volar angulation deformity should have the splint placed on the palmar side. If the fracture involves a translational deformity, the splint should be placed on the palmar aspect to counteract the pull of the stronger flexor muscles. Hand and wrist anatomy is revealed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-basic-biomechanics-of-the-wrist\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and basic biomechanics of the wrist&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The joints proximal and distal to the fracture should be immobilized. As an example, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint should be immobilized for a proximal phalanx fracture. The adjacent digit should also be immobilized in such a case in order to passively correct any rotational deformity and reduce the pull of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50836\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50836 \">table 3</a>).</p><p> The vast majority of hand fractures can be immobilized in the same &quot;safe&quot; position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77837\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77837 \">picture 2</a>), which involves the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wrist</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>The wrist is splinted in 10 to 20 degrees of extension. This is done to avoid contracture and maintain maximum hand strength. The volar radiocarpal ligaments are stronger, shorter, and more prone to contracture compared to the dorsal radiocarpal ligaments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metacarpophalangeal (MCP)</strong> <strong>joint </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The MCP joint is splinted in 50 to 60 degrees of flexion. The metacarpal head is an eccentrically shaped ellipse. This makes the collateral ligaments taut in flexion and lax in extension (the cam effect). Thus, it is preferable to maintain the MCP joint in flexion to keep the ligaments taut.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>The collateral ligaments of the PIP joint are the same length in flexion and extension. The thick volar plate of the PIP joint is able to accommodate flexion and extension because its proximal end is relatively free and anchored only at the side by the check-rein ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80222\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80222 \">figure 5</a>). The check-rein ligaments are flexible and allow the volar plate to slide proximally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The PIP joint is splinted in full extension, which keeps the check-rein ligaments extended to their full length, whereas maintaining them in flexion can cause contracture. In addition, maintaining the PIP joint in flexion for a long period stresses the extensor expansion and central slip, which may lead to a boutonniere deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74107\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74107 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>The DIP joint is splinted in full extension to avoid stressing the terminal tendon and prevent contracture of the oblique retinacular ligament.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28605169\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of splinting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The joints of the hand, especially the PIP joint, are prone to stiffness and should not be completely immobilized (even in the safe position) for more than three weeks.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most nondisplaced fractures will permit gentle range of motion exercises that can be started early (typically 7 to 10 days after injury). Patients are given a splint for protection, advised to keep moving the joints intermittently, and started on strengthening exercises and loading the joint after four weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Displaced fractures that have been reduced should be splinted and immobilized for three weeks. This period will allow the fracture fragments to consolidate and prevent re-displacement once the splint is removed. After three weeks, the joints can be taken through gentle range of motion exercises.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A protective splint should be maintained until bony healing is complete (usually four to six weeks). Clinically, bony healing is evidenced by absence of tenderness over the fracture site; this may precede radiographic evidence of bony healing by up to four weeks.

They are often caused by a direct blow or a crush injury, which can produce significant soft tissue damage and nail bed injuries. Patients with a distal phalanx fracture usually complain of tenderness and swelling at the end of the finger following trauma. Distal phalanx fractures include tuft fractures, shaft fractures, and intra-articular fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F65798\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65798 \">figure 8</a>). Distal phalanx fractures may be associated with nail bed injuries and associated subungual hematomas that may require drainage of the hematoma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> repair of the nail bed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-phalanx-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal phalanx fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subungual-hematoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subungual hematoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Notable distal phalanx injuries include extensor tendon injury of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint (commonly called a mallet finger) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) avulsion injuries (commonly called a Jersey finger). Mallet finger injury is caused by sudden forced flexion of an extended DIP joint, resulting in avulsion of the attachment of the extensor tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76065\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76065 \">image 1</a>). Examination is most notable for a fixed flexed posture of the DIP joint, loss of active extension, and tenderness over the dorsal aspect of the joint.</p><p>Jersey finger is caused by sudden forced extension of a flexed DIP joint, resulting in avulsion of the attachment of the FDP, and is commonly seen in rugby or American football players. The patient may present with bruising and swelling at the location of the proximal stump with inability to actively flex the DIP joint. The diagnosis is often missed initially.</p><p>The presentation, diagnosis, and management of mallet finger and Jersey finger are discussed separately.

Fractures of the neck of the small or ring finger metacarpal are often referred to as a &quot;boxer's fracture,&quot; but in fact these injuries rarely occur in professional boxers. Most often, they occur in young men who punch a wall in anger. Such fractures may be unstable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metacarpal-neck-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metacarpal neck fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metacarpal shaft fractures are common and if displaced, particularly if they are oblique, spiral, or comminuted, require surgical fixation.

Details of the mechanism of injury and an understanding of common injury patterns associated with particular mechanisms help to guide the examination and choice of radiologic studies. (See <a href=\"#H10043286\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiographs of the injured part of the finger <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hand should be obtained. The radiographs obtained depend on the injuries suspected, as determined by the physical examination and mechanism of injury. (See <a href=\"#H28605137\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A precise description of the location and details of any hand fracture helps in guiding the proper radiologic examination and management, and helps when obtaining hand surgery consultation. (See <a href=\"#H1932660\" class=\"local\">'Fracture description'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An open wound may not necessarily communicate with the underlying fracture, but it is better to treat all such fractures as open fractures. An open fracture implies that the fracture is contaminated. Patients with open fractures require immediate removal of any gross contaminants, gentle irrigation of the wound with isotonic saline, placement of an appropriate dressing, and prophylactic antibiotics. They should be referred to a hand surgeon as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"#H764751026\" class=\"local\">'Open fracture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with open fractures should immediately be given a dose of a broad spectrum antibiotic to reduce the risk of soft tissue infection and osteomyelitis. For patients at risk for methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA), prophylactic antibiotics should include an agent with activity against MRSA. (See <a href=\"#H764751026\" class=\"local\">'Open fracture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distinguishing between stable and unstable fracture patterns helps to determine the urgency of referral to the hand surgeon. Patients with closed unstable fractures should be evaluated by the surgeon within two to three days of injury, whereas patients with closed stable fractures can be evaluated in approximately 7 to 10 days. In the intervening period, the hand is splinted, appropriate analgesics are prescribed, and the patient is advised to keep the limb elevated to reduce swelling and pain. (See <a href=\"#H1836921\" class=\"local\">'Stability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splinting plays an important role in the management of musculoskeletal injuries, particularly those involving extremity fractures and joint dislocation. Immobilization of the extremity by splinting decreases pain and bleeding and prevents further soft tissue, vascular, and neurologic compromise. (See <a href=\"#H10043308\" class=\"local\">'Splinting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures of the distal phalanx and the middle and proximal phalanges require differing approaches depending on the characteristics of the injury.
