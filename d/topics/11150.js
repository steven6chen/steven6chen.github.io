Migraines often start off mild and then get worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361725\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of migraines in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of migraines are different based on the child's age:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In toddlers, symptoms include suddenly getting very pale, being less active than normal, and vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In young children, migraines can cause nausea, vomiting, and belly pain, and make children sensitive to light and noise. The headache is often throbbing. It can affect the whole head or just parts of the head. For example, it might affect just the forehead or just the sides of the head.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In older teens, the symptoms tend to be more like the symptoms adults get. The headache usually starts off slowly and affects only one side of the head. But in younger teens, both sides of the head are often affected.</p><p/><p>No matter what age, most children feel better if they lie down in a quiet, dark room while they are having a migraine.</p><p>Some children have something called a migraine &quot;aura.&quot; An aura is a symptom or feeling that happens before or during the migraine headache. Each child's aura is different, but in most cases the aura affects a child's vision. As part of an aura a child might see flashing lights, bright spots, zig-zag lines, or lose part of his or her vision. Another child might have an aura with numbness and tingling of the lips, lower face, and fingers of one hand. The aura usually lasts a few minutes to an hour and then goes away.</p><p>Many children get symptoms that happen several hours or even a day before the migraine headache. Doctors call these &quot;premonitory&quot; or &quot;prodromal&quot; symptoms. The most common are fatigue, irritability, paleness of the face, and shadows under the eyes.</p><p>Some teenage girls get migraines every month, around the time their menstrual periods begin. These are called &quot;menstrual migraines.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361742\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Take your child to the doctor right away (without giving any medicine) if he or she has a headache that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts after a head injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wakes him or her up from sleeping</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is sudden and severe and happens with other symptoms, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neck pain or stiffness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Double vision or changes in vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loss of balance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever of 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher</p><p/><p>You should also take your child to see a doctor or nurse if he or she has a headache and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets headaches more than once a month</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is younger than 3 years old</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361759\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests my child should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. Your child's doctor or nurse will probably be able to tell what is causing your child's headaches by doing an exam and by learning about his or her symptoms. But if your child's doctor or nurse thinks your child has a serious problem, he or she might order an imaging test such as an MRI or a CT scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361776\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to help when my child has a migraine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When your child's migraine starts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child rest in a quiet dark room with a cool cloth on his or her forehead.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encourage him or her to sleep.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give your child only the medicine or medicines that you have talked to your doctor about.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361793\"><span class=\"h1\">How are migraines treated in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are lots of prescription and non-prescription medicines that can ease the pain of migraines. There are also prescription medicines that can help prevent migraines from happening in the first place. The right medicine for your child will depend on how often he or she gets migraines and how severe they are. If your child gets migraines often, work with his or her doctor to find a treatment that helps.</p><p>If your child has headaches often, do not try to manage them on your own with non-prescription pain medicines. Giving non-prescription pain medicines too often can cause more headaches later.</p><p>Some types of behavior therapy, such as relaxation exercises, might help to prevent migraines in some people. However, these might not help young children, and health insurance might not pay for them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361808\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to keep my child from getting a migraine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Things that might help include good sleep habits, regular meal schedules, and regular exercise.</p><p>In some cases, migraines can be 'triggered' or set off by certain foods or things that children do. Some possible headache triggers are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skipping meals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not drinking enough fluids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleeping too much or too little</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain foods</p><p/><p>If you can figure out what is triggering your child's headaches, you might be able to help your child avoid those triggers. To find possible triggers, keep a headache diary for your child. In the diary, write down every time your child has a headache along with the following education:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The times it started and ended</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where in the head the headache was, for example, left side, right side, both sides, or behind the eyes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How the headache felt, for example, &quot;pounding&quot; or &quot;sharp&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What your child ate and did before the headache started</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How bad the headache was &ndash; Using the FACES pain scale can help (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51303\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51303 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What you did to try to help, for example, having your child rest in a dark room</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What, if any, medicine you gave, including the name of the medicine and how much you gave</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any other symptoms your child had with the headache, for example, numbness in his or her lips</p><p/><p>After you have been keeping a diary for a while, check to see if there are any foods or events that seem to bring on a headache. Then, try avoiding those triggers to see if headaches happen less. Share the diary with your child's doctor or nurse. It can help him or her understand your child's headaches and choose the best treatment for your child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361825\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Headache in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-headaches-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Migraine headaches in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
