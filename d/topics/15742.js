Single umbilical artery (SUA) refers to a variation of umbilical cord anatomy in which there is only one umbilical artery.

The umbilical cord contains two patent vessels, an artery of allantoic origin and a vein derived from the left umbilical vein. This type of SUA has been associated with genitourinary anomalies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 accounts for 1.5 percent of cases. The umbilical cord contains two patent vessels, an umbilical artery of vitelline origin arising from the superior mesenteric artery and a vein arising from the left umbilical vein. Severe fetal anomalies, such as caudal regression syndrome and sirenomelia, have been associated with Type 2 SUA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 3 is rare. The umbilical cord contains three patent vessels, one artery of allantoic origin and two veins. The veins arise from the left umbilical vein and a persistent anomalous right umbilical vein. This form of SUA has been associated with major congenital anomalies, resulting in a poor fetal prognosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 4 is extremely rare. It consists of one artery of either vitelline or allantoic origin and a vein derived from the right umbilical vein. There may be an increased risk of embryonic loss.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1437016\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of SUA depends on characteristics of the population studied:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At 11 to 14 weeks of gestation before chorionic villus sampling &ndash; 5.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At 16 to 23 weeks of gestation on prenatal ultrasound in an unselected population &ndash; 0.48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among fetal deaths, autopsies, or aborted fetuses &ndash; 2.13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among live born infants &ndash; 0.55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p>SUA has been reported to occur more frequently in pregnancies at the extremes of maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and in Eastern Europeans, and less frequently in Japanese and Africans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There are inconsistent data that male fetuses are more often affected than females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and are more likely to have additional malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>SUA is more common in twin pregnancies (3.9 to 8.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/8,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10-13</a>], with similar prevalence in monochorionic and dichorionic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Isolated SUA has been reported on prenatal ultrasound in 1.7 percent of twins at 17 to 22 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In twins discordant for SUA, the smaller twin is more likely to have the single artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/8,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14,16</a>]. SUA is invariably present in acardiac twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H652308550\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SUA has been associated with maternal smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and seizure disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H652308657\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SUA is a finding on obstetrical ultrasound examination. In the second and third trimesters, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine recommends imaging the umbilical cord as part of a standard prenatal ultrasound examination and evaluating the number of vessels in the cord, when possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. SUA can be detected in the first trimester, but sensitivity and specificity are higher in the second trimester (sensitivity: 57.1 versus 86.6 percent, specificity: 98.9 versus 99.9 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]). Associated fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> placental abnormalities are common. (See <a href=\"#H652310061\" class=\"local\">'Assessment for associated abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2002781113\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound examination shows only two vessels in the umbilical cord. Larger studies report the left artery is absent more often than the right (59 versus 41 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/1,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19,20</a>]. The side (left or right) of the missing artery does not appear to have clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>], with the exception of one study that reported complex fetal anomalies and chromosomal abnormalities occurred exclusively when SUA resulted from the absence of the left umbilical artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Most umbilical cords have a normal diameter despite SUA, but the cord may be velamentous or have a small diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In the longitudinal view, the two-vessel cord frequently appears straight and non-coiled, although occasionally the single artery may loop around the vein. </p><p>Absence of one umbilical artery in the cord necessarily implies the absence of the corresponding intraabdominal portion of the umbilical artery. </p><p>The single umbilical artery is larger than normal. In the normal three-vessel cord, blood flow to the placenta is approximately equally distributed through both arteries. In the two-vessel cord, the entire fetoplacental circulation is transported through only one artery, resulting in a compensatory increase of the arterial diameter. The diameter of the single artery usually measures more than 50 percent of the diameter of the vein, resulting in an umbilical vein-to-artery ratio &lt;2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63821\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63821 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In contrast, the arteries in a three-vessel cord usually measure less than 50 percent of the diameter of the vein, resulting in an umbilical vein-to-artery ratio &gt;2. The compensatory increase in the single artery diameter can be seen as early as the early second trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>High-resolution color Doppler ultrasound may demonstrate differences in the impedance indices in the pelvic circulation of fetuses with SUA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The discordant intraluminal blood flow between common iliac arteries is more marked as pregnancy progresses, which may be due to both the decrease in resistance in the placental circulation and the increase in resistance in femoral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8000248\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126591515\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal three-vessel cord</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the number of umbilical vessels in the umbilical cord can be difficult in the first trimester due to the small size of the vessels. In the second and third trimesters, the three umbilical vessels in a normal umbilical cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109920\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109920 \">image 1</a>) can be easily visualized in a cross-sectional image of the cord by two-dimensional ultrasound examination. Color flow Doppler imaging of the intra-abdominal portions of the umbilical arteries running alongside the fetal bladder confirms the diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3446637748\"><span class=\"h2\">Single umbilical artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis of SUA is based on the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound examination showing only two vessels in the umbilical cord (cross section or longitudinally) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73747\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73747 \">image 2A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The larger vessel is the vein and the smaller vessel is the artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the transverse plane, the two-vessel cord resembles a &ldquo;soda can tab&rdquo; when the amount of Wharton's jelly is adequate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Color flow Doppler in the region of the bifurcation of the fetal aorta shows intra-abdominal umbilical vessels on only one side of the fetal bladder, which is pathognomonic of SUA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56497%7EOBGYN%2F72664\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56497 graphicRef72664 \">image 3A-B</a>). This is particularly helpful in the first trimester and can facilitate early diagnosis of SUA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109922\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109922 \">image 4</a>).</p><p/><p>Counting the number of cord vessels in a free loop of cord is difficult because multiple loops of cord are in close proximity to each other. Counting the number of cord vessels in a hypercoiled cord is also difficult (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79742\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79742 \">image 5</a>). Color Doppler of intra-abdominal vessels can be more informative in these settings than standard real-time imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H484749579\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1373120721\"><span class=\"h3\">Fused arteries at the insertion site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potential diagnostic pitfall is only imaging the cord close to the placental insertion because the umbilical arteries may fuse along a short (&lt;3 cm) segment of cord at this site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This results in an umbilical cord with a short distal (placental) segment with two vessels and a long proximal (fetal) segment with three vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51055\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51055 \">image 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Imaging intra-abdominal vessels on both sides of the bladder excludes the diagnosis of SUA in these cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4187998467\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypoplasia of one umbilical artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoplasia of one umbilical artery is a variant of SUA in which both arteries are present, but there is a gross disparity in their size and blood flow. The hypoplastic but functional artery can occasionally be detected prenatally by ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/34-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-40</a>]. Constriction of the umbilical arteries after delivery makes the diagnosis difficult to document postnatally in spite of routine examination of the umbilical cord.

The same authors' review of the literature found 809 cases of isolated SUA of which six (0.7 percent) had an abnormal karyotype (three trisomy 18 and three trisomy 21).</p><p>Most experts do not consider isolated SUA a high-risk factor for offering invasive fetal genetic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/1,40,43,50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,40,43,50-52</a>]. However, offering noninvasive conventional serum screening or a cell-free DNA screening test for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 is reasonable. Invasive diagnostic testing (karyotype with microarray) should be offered to women in whom additional fetal abnormalities are observed (eg, anatomic abnormalities, symmetric growth restriction) or the aneuploidy screening test is positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], given the increased risk of fetal genetic abnormalities in each of these settings.

In a 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis that pooled data from three cohort studies and four case-control studies (n = 928 pregnancies) comparing pregnancy outcomes with isolated SUA versus a three-vessel cord, isolated SUA was associated with trends toward small for gestational age (SGA) (odds ratio [OR] 1.6, 95% CI 0.97-2.6) and a small reduction in mean birth weight (51 grams, 95% CI -154.7 to 52.6 g) that were not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Studies were eligible for the analysis if they described at least 30 cases of isolated SUA as identified by ultrasound before an average gestational age of 24 completed weeks.

It may be an isolated finding or associated with fetal abnormalities. The left artery is absent more often than the right; however, the side (left or right) of the missing artery does not appear to have clinical significance. (See <a href=\"#H8000241\" class=\"local\">'Embryogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2002781113\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound findings'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SUA occurs in approximately 0.5 percent of unselected pregnancies undergoing second-trimester ultrasound examination, but is more common in twins and in fetal deaths, autopsies, and aborted fetuses. (See <a href=\"#H1437016\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prenatal diagnosis of SUA is based on the following (see <a href=\"#H8000248\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ultrasound examination showing only two vessels in the umbilical cord (cross section or longitudinally) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73747%7EOBGYN%2F78465\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73747 graphicRef78465 \">image 2A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Color flow Doppler in the region of the bifurcation of the fetal aorta showing intra-abdominal umbilical arteries on only one side of the fetal bladder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56497\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56497 \">image 3A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72664\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72664 \">image 3B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A potential diagnostic pitfall is only imaging the cord close to the placental insertion, where a short segment may contain only two vessels while the remainder of the cord contains three vessels. (See <a href=\"#H1373120721\" class=\"local\">'Fused arteries at the insertion site'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comprehensive sonographic evaluation of the fetus, cord, and placenta should be performed to look for other anomalies, especially genitourinary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system anomalies. Fetal echocardiography is not necessary if a standard four-chamber view of the heart and views of the great arteries are normal and the patient has no other indications for fetal echocardiography. (See <a href=\"#H652310061\" class=\"local\">'Assessment for associated abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnancies with isolated SUA, screening for trisomy 21, 13, or 18 by conventional serum screening or cell-free fetal DNA screening is a reasonable first-line approach. Invasive testing with microarray should be offered to women who have pregnancies with nonisolated SUA or who screen positive. (See <a href=\"#H881038946\" class=\"local\">'Fetal genetic studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated SUA may have a small effect on fetal growth and birth weight, but data are inadequate to make a clear conclusion. In nonisolated SUA, chromosomal and anatomic abnormalities likely have a greater impact on fetal growth than the number of arteries in the umbilical cord. (See <a href=\"#H8000276\" class=\"local\">'Small for gestational age and birth weight'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increases in fetal, neonatal, and infant death have been reported with isolated SUA, but findings have been inconsistent and inconclusive. In nonisolated SUA, perinatal morbidity and mortality are increased and depend on the underlying chromosomal and anatomic anomalies. (See <a href=\"#H8000311\" class=\"local\">'Perinatal outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The authors perform ultrasound examinations every four to six weeks to screen for growth delay, given the possibly increased risk of this complication in SUA. However, there is no evidence that routine sonographic screening for growth restriction improves perinatal outcome in isolated SUA, and not performing serial ultrasound examinations or performing a single screening examination at 32 weeks is also reasonable. (See <a href=\"#H8000276\" class=\"local\">'Small for gestational age and birth weight'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because an increase in perinatal mortality has been reported for isolated SUA without comorbidities, the author orders weekly fetal assessment by biophysical profile or nonstress test from 32 weeks to delivery, even in the absence of growth restriction or other standard indications for antepartum fetal surveillance. However, it is also reasonable to restrict this testing to pregnancies with standard clinical indications. (See <a href=\"#H881039343\" class=\"local\">'Antepartum fetal monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SUA alone does not affect the timing or route of delivery. The pediatric provider should be notified of the prenatal findings. (See <a href=\"#H881039385\" class=\"local\">'Delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/single-umbilical-artery/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Abuhamad AZ, Shaffer W, Mari G, et al.
