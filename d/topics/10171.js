It can also cause a rash, fever, or nerve, joint, or heart problems.</p><p>People can get Lyme disease after being bitten by a tiny insect called a tick. When a certain type of tick bites you, it can transmit the germ that causes Lyme disease from its body to yours. But a tick can infect you only if it stays attached for at least a day and a half.</p><p>The ticks that carry Lyme disease feed on deer and mice. Ticks are found in tall grass and on shrubs, and can attach to animals and people walking by. Ticks cannot fly or jump.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542901999\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Lyme disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can start days or weeks after a tick bite. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rash where you were bitten &ndash; The rash often appears within a month of getting bitten. It is red, but its center can be the color of your skin. It might get bigger over a few days. To some, it looks like a &quot;bull's eye&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58798\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58798 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body aches and pains</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart problems such as a slowed heart rate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache and stiff neck</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feelings of pain, weakness, or numbness</p><p/><p>If a person is not treated, further symptoms can occur months to years after a tick bite. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain and swelling of joints, such as your knees</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble with your memory and thinking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin problems, such as skin swelling or thinning (this occurs mostly in Europe)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2540689366\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have symptoms of Lyme disease, see a doctor or nurse. Some people don't know that they were bitten by a tick. Or they might not remember having a rash or other early symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542902006\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Lyme disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Blood tests can show if you are infected with the germ that causes Lyme disease. But it takes time for the blood tests to turn positive. This means the tests won't work if you get them right after being bitten. Also, the blood tests usually come back negative when you have the initial rash that goes with Lyme disease. Because of this, if you have the rash, you do <strong>not</strong> need a blood test to confirm that you have Lyme disease.</p><p>If your doctor or nurse suspects you have Lyme disease, he or she will do an exam and ask you questions. The doctor or nurse will use this information (and your blood test result, if needed) to decide about treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909512592\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Lyme disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lyme disease is usually treated with antibiotics. There are a few different types. Treatment with antibiotics should help your symptoms go away. Sometimes, symptoms improve quickly. Other times, it can take weeks or months for symptoms to go away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H298350467\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant, talk to your doctor. Some medicines for Lyme disease are safe to take if you are pregnant, but others are not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2368242873\"><span class=\"h1\">Can Lyme disease be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid getting bitten by a tick. But if you were already bitten, your doctor might give you an antibiotic. In some situations, this can reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease.</p><p>To try to <strong>avoid</strong> getting bitten by a tick, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear shoes, long-sleeved shirts, and long pants when you go outside. Keep ticks away from your skin by tucking your pants into your socks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear light colors so you can spot any ticks that get on your clothes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear bug spray or cream that contains DEET. (Do not use DEET on babies younger than 2 months.) On your clothes and gear, you can use bug repellents that have a chemical called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">permethrin</a>.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shower within 2 hours of being outdoors if you think you have been in an area where there are ticks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put dry clothes briefly (for about 4 minutes) in a dryer after being outdoors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your clothes and body for ticks after being outdoors. Be sure to check your scalp, waist, armpits, groin, and backs of your knees. Check your children, too.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you live in a place that has deer or mice nearby, take steps to keep those animals away. Deer and mice carry ticks.</p><p/><p>If you <strong>find a tick</strong> on your body or on your child, use tweezers to grab it. Then pull it out slowly and gently. After that, wash the area with soap and water.</p><p>You do not need to keep the tick. But knowing what it looked like can help your doctor decide about your treatment. See if you can tell:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Its color and size</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If it was attached to your skin or just resting on your skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If it was big, round, and full of blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51825\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51825 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p/><p>You should see your doctor or nurse if you have a tick and you cannot get it off.</p><p>You should also call your doctor or nurse if you think you have had a tick attached for at least 36 hours (a day and a half). Then he or she can decide if you need to take a dose of an antibiotic to help prevent Lyme. Doctors only recommend antibiotics to prevent Lyme disease in some situations. It depends on your age, where you live, what kind of tick bit you, and how long it was attached.</p><p>If you or your child was bitten by a deer tick, you should watch the area around the bite for a month to see if a rash appears.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542902048\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites-and-stings-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insect bites and stings (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lyme disease symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-do-after-a-tick-bite-to-prevent-lyme-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: What to do after a tick bite to prevent Lyme disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lyme disease treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lyme disease prevention (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
