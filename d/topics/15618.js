They function to protect the tendon and enhance its mechanical effect. Most sesamoid bones are small and resemble grains of sesame; the meaning of the word's greek root is &quot;shaped like a sesame.&quot; The two largest sesamoids in the foot reside near the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint and are susceptible to fracture.</p><p>This topic review will discuss sesamoid fractures of the foot in adults. Other foot fractures are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toe-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toe fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-metatarsal-shaft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the metatarsal shaft&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metatarsal-shaft-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metatarsal shaft fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two relatively large sesamoids adjacent to the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F80813\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80813 \">image 1</a>). Injuries to these sesamoids comprise 12 percent of injuries to the great toe complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Small sesamoids are occasionally seen elsewhere in the foot, most notably beneath the fifth MTP joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53384%7EEM%2F74938%7EEM%2F66231\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53384 graphicRef74938 graphicRef66231 \">image 2A-C</a>). These smaller sesamoids are rarely of clinical significance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78924%7EEM%2F61079%7EEM%2F71857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924 graphicRef61079 graphicRef71857 \">figure 1A-C</a>).</p><p>The sesamoids of the first MTP joint are embedded within the tendon of the flexor hallucis brevis and allow for increased dorsiflexion of the MTP. They are also involved in shock absorption, reduction of friction, and protection of tendons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The medial (ie, tibial) sesamoid is thought to bear greater force during the normal gait cycle and is more commonly fractured from either direct force or cumulative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The lateral (ie, fibular) sesamoid is injured much less often.</p><p>It is important to recognize that sesamoids are sometimes &quot;partite,&quot; ie, one sesamoid is made up of two or three separate pieces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F62386\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62386 \">image 3</a>). A study of 35 cadaveric feet found the incidence of partite sesamoids to be 11.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This finding is comparable to other studies. Partite sesamoids are frequently bilateral. Hence, bilateral comparison views are sometimes helpful in distinguishing a partite from a fractured sesamoid. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Partite sesamoids'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct blows and forced hyperdorsiflexion can lead to acute sesamoid fractures. However, stress fractures are more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress fractures&quot;</a>.) One study found sesamoid injuries occur most commonly in long distance running and in sports that require rapid acceleration and deceleration, such as tennis, racquetball, football, soccer, and volleyball [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a sesamoid stress fracture usually complain of poorly localized pain around the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint for several weeks. Swelling is not generally seen until the injury has progressed. Erythema is typically absent.</p><p>Often, the patient is unable to localize the pain until the examiner directly palpates the injured sesamoid. Passive dorsiflexion of the first MTP joint can elicit pain in sesamoid fractures. If this movement does not produce pain and a fracture is suspected, some suggest holding the MTP in maximal dorsiflexion and deeply palpating the suspected area, while the patient tries to plantar flex the great toe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of sesamoid fractures includes: bursitis, sesamoiditis, osteochondritis, chondromalacia, tenosynovitis, flexor hallucis brevis tendonitis, medial plantar digital nerve impingement, and sesamoid-metatarsal arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. History and examination alone are insufficient to distinguish these injuries from a stress fracture of the sesamoid; radiographic studies are required.</p><p>A presumptive diagnosis of sesamoiditis is made if the following conditions are met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal pain is present over a sesamoid.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain with passive dorsiflexion of the MTP is present.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No swelling or redness is present.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographs show no fracture is present.</p><p/><p>However, if rest from activity and shoe orthoses do not resolve pain in two to four weeks, other diagnoses, such as a subtle sesamoid fracture, should be entertained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard anteroposterior (AP), oblique, and lateral views of the foot are generally sufficient to demonstrate sesamoid fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74397%7EEM%2F52221\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74397 graphicRef52221 \">image 4A-B</a>). Dedicated sesamoid views, such as lateral oblique (which shows the fibular sesamoid), medial oblique (which shows the tibial sesamoid), and axial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76929\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76929 \">image 5</a>) views can be obtained, if standard x-rays are negative but there remains a high index of suspicion.</p><p>Fractures of the sesamoids are usually transverse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74397%7EEM%2F52221\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74397 graphicRef52221 \">image 4A-B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Like scaphoid fractures, sesamoid fractures may not be apparent on initial radiographs. X-rays should be repeated after two weeks of presumptive therapy if a fracture is strongly suspected but initial films are negative. Rarely, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be needed for a definitive diagnosis if it remains unclear. Bone marrow edema may suggest a stress fracture, but sesamoiditis may show similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Partite sesamoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Partite sesamoids, a normal variant, may be confused with fractured sesamoids. Fracture lines of sesamoids usually have irregular edges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74397%7EEM%2F52221\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74397 graphicRef52221 \">image 4A-B</a>), in contrast to the smooth borders of a partite sesamoid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F62386\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62386 \">image 3</a>). In addition, partite sesamoids usually demonstrate even cortication around their entire circumference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51617\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51617 \">image 6</a>), whereas the fracture line of a sesamoid will lack cortication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74397%7EEM%2F52221\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74397 graphicRef52221 \">image 4A-B</a>).</p><p>Bilateral comparison plain radiographs, a bone scan, or MRI can be obtained to distinguish a partite sesamoid from a fracture when plain films are unclear. Fracture is unlikely if tenderness is minimal and comparison radiographs demonstrate a partite sesamoid with similar appearance. One should bear in mind, however, that partite sesamoids can sustain fractures. Such fractures generally demonstrate modest point tenderness until healing is underway.</p><p>A bone scan may also help differentiate a partite sesamoid from a fracture. However, it is a non-specific study: sesamoiditis can result in a positive bone scan showing diffuse uptake in the plantar area of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic pitfalls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians commonly mistake sesamoids and accessory bones for avulsion fractures on x-rays. To avoid this error, it is helpful to know the location of the most common sesamoids and accessory bones. In the foot, the most common sesamoids lie in the area of the first and fifth MTP joints. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above.) The most common accessory bones are found proximal to the base of the fifth (ie, small) metatarsal (os vesalianum), adjacent to the cuboid in the peroneus longus tendon (os peroneum), adjacent to the navicular (os tibiale externum), and posterior to the talus (os trigonum) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78924%7EEM%2F61079%7EEM%2F71857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924 graphicRef61079 graphicRef71857 \">figure 1A-C</a>). A detailed discussion of accessory bones is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-overview-of-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Overview of causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR CONSULTATION OR REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open fractures require urgent referral. Displaced sesamoid fractures, which are rare, should also be referred. Early referral should also be considered for athletes, dancers, and other patients who are anxious to return to full activity.</p><p>For nondisplaced fractures, referral is advised if healing has not occurred by four to six months (nonunion) or if symptoms are still bothersome after four to six months. Patients requiring referral can be sent to either a podiatrist or an orthopedist, depending on local availability and expertise. Podiatrists often have more experience in both conservative and operative care of sesamoid injuries, with the exception of orthopedists who specialize in the foot and ankle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians can treat sesamoid fractures in several ways. Abstaining from the activity thought to have caused the fracture is common to all approaches. In addition, some type of padding or bracing footwear is used, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C or O-shaped padding around the sesamoid to unload it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molded orthosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wood-soled shoe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-leg cast</p><p/><p>The severity of symptoms often dictates which approach is chosen. If the patient is pain-free with weight-bearing, some treat with a molded orthosis for six to eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. With acute traumatic fractures or highly symptomatic stress fractures, some recommend casting for three to four weeks followed by a firm-soled shoe and padding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Others recommend no weight-bearing during the initial three to four weeks, but this level of protection is unnecessary in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The optimal treatment remains controversial. Some authors claim prolonged conservative treatment with immobilization is ineffective in treating sesamoid fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>]. Nonetheless, before pursuing surgery, conservative treatment using one of the approaches described above seems prudent. We recommend using the least intrusive and least expensive intervention that achieves satisfactory pain control during ambulation. Often, treatment with C or O pads and a stiff-soled shoe yields satisfactory results.</p><p>Nonopioid analgesics may be used to help control pain. While some authors recommend nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat pain from stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], others have questioned their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The effects of NSAIDs upon fracture healing is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Healing of musculoskeletal injury'</a>.)</p><p>Significant pain during ambulation can be reduced by maximizing the use of physical interventions such as orthoses. Pain during rest can be reduced using medications other than NSAIDS, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Padding, use of a firm-soled shoe, or immobilization should be continued for six to eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Follow-up is performed one to two weeks after diagnosis and monthly thereafter. It is not uncommon for sesamoid fractures to remain painful for several months.</p><p>If pain persists and the fracture does not heal, the goal of treatment changes from bone healing to pain reduction. This can involve partial excision of the sesamoid. It is unclear when this change in treatment priorities should be made. Some diagnose permanent nonunion of the sesamoid bone if no healing has occurred six months after the fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Referral is therefore recommended if significant symptoms remain four to six months after diagnosis.</p><p>Surgical options include partial sesamoidectomy, bone grafting, or complete sesamoidectomy in cases involving avascular necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Total excision of both sesamoids is not recommended, as this can lead to disabling deformity (the so-called &quot;cock-up toe&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sesamoid-fractures-of-the-foot/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO WORK AND SPORTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the initial six to eight week treatment period, patients may return to activities as their symptoms permit. Mild persistent pain can be treated with a pad to unload the sesamoid. Patients should be told to increase their activities by <strong>no more than 10 percent per week</strong>. Rapid increases in the volume or intensity of activity can lead to recurrence of stress fractures. The patient should cut back on activities immediately if symptoms increase and seek reevaluation if they persist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sesamoid fractures are a common cause of pain near the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint.
