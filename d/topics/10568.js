Damage control surgery associated with trauma and abdominal compartment syndrome are the most frequent reasons for leaving an abdomen open. Open abdomen exposes the viscera and leads to fluid and heat loss, which can be reduced with temporary abdominal closure techniques until the abdomen can be closed primarily, closed functionally, or graft coverage of the exposed viscera provided. </p><p>The care of the patient with an open abdomen, techniques for placement of temporary abdominal dressings and timing and methods of abdominal closure will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and management of abdominal compartment syndrome is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal compartment syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632146279\"><span class=\"h1\">OPEN ABDOMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open abdomen is an abdominal wall defect created by intentionally leaving an abdominal incision open at the completion of intraabdominal surgery or by opening (or re-opening) the abdomen because of concern for abdominal compartment syndrome. Open abdomen can also be the result of injuries to the abdominal wall that produce significant soft tissue defects. The indications for open abdomen vary from region to region. As an example, in the United States, the most common indication for open abdomen is damage control surgery related to managing abdominal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], whereas in a review from the United Kingdom, the most common indication for open abdomen was abdominal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Open abdomen is managed with temporary abdominal closure using one of several techniques, followed by interval abdominal closure, preferably by bringing the edges of the abdominal fascia together primarily (primary closure) or, if this is not feasible, using a functional closure or simple coverage. The techniques of temporary closure and closure of the abdomen are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H632146314\" class=\"local\">'Temporary abdominal closure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H632146444\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal closure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255249462\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common circumstances that result in open abdomen include the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67794622\"><span class=\"h3\">Damage control surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Damage control is an operative strategy that is used to manage immediately life-threatening conditions by delaying definitive management of less severe injuries until the patient is physiologically capable of withstanding <span class=\"nowrap\">repair/reconstruction</span>. This strategy is used most frequently in severely injured or critically ill patients who are hemodynamically unstable. Because a repeat procedure is required for definitive repair, the abdomen is left open to facilitate reexploration which is generally delayed until hypovolemia, hypothermia and coagulopathy are corrected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Leaving the abdomen open also obviates abdominal compartment syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of damage control surgery and resuscitation in patients sustaining severe injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67794629\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal compartment syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome can be due to any process that increases the volume of the confined space of the abdominal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Increased volume in the abdomen is typically the result of an increase in interstitial fluid as is seen with large volume resuscitation, but space occupying fluid (blood or ascites) in the peritoneum or retroperitoneum can also contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Abdominal compartment syndrome, including its etiology and strategies for prevention, is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal compartment syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Etiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67794601\"><span class=\"h3\">Septic abdomen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bowel perforation with severe contamination of the peritoneal cavity can result in recurrent intra-abdominal sepsis and postoperative abscess formation in spite of aggressive abdominal irrigation. Under this circumstance, it may be desirable to leave the abdominal wall open and use negative-pressure wound therapy to remove residual or reaccumulating fluid or pus. The temporary abdominal dressing facilitates access for repeated abdominal exploration and abdominal irrigation, as needed, until bacterial counts are reduced and closure can be performed. This management strategy is associated with a reduced risk of postoperative infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-abdominal-surgical-incisions#H174061378\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of abdominal surgical incisions&quot;, section on 'Delayed closure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67794608\"><span class=\"h3\">Refractory intracranial hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A more controversial indication for open abdomen is refractory intracranial hypertension associated with traumatic brain injury. This indication is based upon case reports and small case series that suggest that the abdominal decompression lowers venous pressures augmenting venous outflow from the head and decreasing intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute severe traumatic brain injury&quot;, section on 'Intracranial pressure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255249176\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications of open abdomen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leaving the abdomen open, when indicated, is beneficial but is also associated with complications related to fluid efflux from the abdomen, exposure of the bowel, and abdominal muscle retraction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid loss &ndash; A significant amount of fluid can be lost through an open abdomen. If a closed suction system is used as a part of the temporary abdominal closure, this fluid can be quantified and included in the assessment of daily fluid balance and the patient's fluid intake adjusted to prevent hypovolemia. Some temporary abdominal closure systems do not have the ability to collect and quantify fluid losses (eg, Bogota bag). (See <a href=\"#H15191189\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein loss &ndash; The fluid that is secreted by the peritoneum is rich in protein with approximately 2 grams of protein lost from the abdomen for each liter of fluid removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These losses must be accounted for in the patient's nutrition plan. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fistula formation &ndash; With open abdomen, the bowel is frequently manipulated and is at risk for injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The incidence of entero-cutaneous or entero-atmospheric fistula may be as high as 20 percent and can occur as early as eight days from the initial laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Patients with a bowel anastomosis are at the highest risk. Whenever possible, bowel anastomoses should be covered by omentum or other viscera and protected from exposure to air as well as any materials associated with the temporary abdominal closure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of domain &ndash; With open abdomen from a midline abdominal incision, the musculature of the abdominal wall retracts the fascia laterally. Once the indication for the open abdomen has resolved, the fascia (and sometimes skin) may not be able to be brought back to the midline for primary closure, resulting in a large ventral hernia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78618\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78618 \">picture 1</a>). The use of a negative pressure wound system helps to counteract the lateral forces on the abdominal wall and may allow primary closure of the fascia and skin or, if primary closure is not possible, at least decreases the size of the resultant hernia. The repair of incisional hernia is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H632146335\" class=\"local\">'Negative pressure wound systems'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults#H21328400\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of abdominal wall hernias in adults&quot;, section on 'Incisional hernia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632146314\"><span class=\"h1\">TEMPORARY ABDOMINAL CLOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a decision has been made to leave the abdomen open (or re-open it), the abdominal defect must be covered, which is termed temporary abdominal closure. The main goal of temporary abdominal closure is to control fluid losses and minimize the loss of domain. It is important to remember that even with a temporary abdominal closure in place, intraabdominal pressure can increase and abdominal compartment syndrome can recur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The optimal method of temporary abdominal closure has not been determined, and no one method is appropriate for every clinical situation. Further study is needed to better define which technique has the best primary closure rates, and to identify subpopulations that might benefit (or be harmed) from a particular technique. (See <a href=\"#H170879412\" class=\"local\">'Rates of primary fascial closure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15191189\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several techniques for temporary abdominal closure are available, including patch closure, negative pressure systems (towel and sponge-based), and silo closure. Each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages with respect to their ability to control fluid loss, frequency of dressing changes, minimizing loss of domain, ease of use, and cost. The patch or silo technique can be used alone or in combination with a negative pressure system. Skin-only closures are an option but are rarely used in contemporary practice. </p><p>The ideal technique for temporary abdominal closure, interval between fascial closure attempts, or the number of closure attempts until an alternative strategy is tried has not been well studied. A systematic review concluded that negative pressure wound therapy systems with continuous fascial traction had the best results in terms of achieving delayed fascial closure, but the overall quality of the available data was poor. Among negative pressure systems, one study found a possible mortality benefit from use of a commercially-available sponge-based (AbThera) compared with a towel-based (Barker) negative pressure wound therapy system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]; however, the study design did not allow the investigators to determine the reason for this (see <a href=\"#H632146335\" class=\"local\">'Negative pressure wound systems'</a> below). The AbThera device may also decrease adhesion formation between the viscera and abdominal side wall due to its large plastic skirt but there have been no studies demonstrating that this results in faster or sturdier fascial closure.</p><p>The authors prefer to start with a commercial negative pressure device to control and quantitate fluid efflux from the abdomen between operative attempts at fascial closure performed every 48 hours. Although the applied negative pressure counteracts some of the lateral forces responsible for loss of abdominal domain, additional adjunctive techniques may be needed to help bring the fascial edges to the midline to improve the rates of primary closure. (See <a href=\"#H170878938\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive techniques'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13451987\" class=\"local\">'Timing of closure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H170879412\" class=\"local\">'Rates of primary fascial closure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255249609\"><span class=\"h3\">Patch techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patch closure of the abdomen refers to the interposition of prosthetic material between the edges of the fascia and suturing it into place. Two main patch techniques are used to provide abdominal closure and allow easy re-entry into the abdomen. Although patching can minimize fascial retraction, control of fluid is suboptimal, and thus, patch techniques are often used in conjunction with a negative pressure system to prevent skin maceration and simplify wound care. (See <a href=\"#H632146335\" class=\"local\">'Negative pressure wound systems'</a> below.)</p><p>The main disadvantage of patch closure is the potential for fascial necrosis due to excess traction on the fascia, or repeated fascial suturing. Any fascial loss decreases the likelihood of future primary fascial closure. Other closure techniques that do not require manipulation of the fascia until closure may be preferred, particularly if the integrity of the fascial tissue is compromised.</p><p>The features of the two most commonly used patch systems are described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wittmann patch &ndash; The Wittmann Patch sheet is sutured to the fascia of the abdominal wall laterally, and closure of the patch at the midline is accomplished with a Velcro-like closure (one sheet with hooks and the other with loops). As edema resolves, the hook and loop sheets are re-adjusted to gradually bring the fascia toward the midline. Thus, this technique can also be considered a dynamic fascial closure technique. The Wittmann Patch significantly improves delayed primary fascial closure rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H170879412\" class=\"local\">'Rates of primary fascial closure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polytetrafluoroethylene patch &ndash; A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch can also be used for temporary closure. The patch is anchored to the fascia laterally, and serial plication of the patch at the midline progressively brings the fascial edges together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632146335\"><span class=\"h3\">Negative pressure wound systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) dressings, also known as vacuum-assisted closure (VAC), is an alternative and frequently-employed technique for temporary abdominal closure. The application of negative pressure opposes the lateral retraction of the abdominal musculature minimizing loss of domain and improves the likelihood of primary fascial closure. (See <a href=\"#H170879412\" class=\"local\">'Rates of primary fascial closure'</a> below.)</p><p>An inert layer (towel adhered to an adhesive sheet or elastic sponge) is placed to protect the abdominal viscera and an elastic self-adhesive sheet secured to the lateral abdominal wall to which a suction system is incorporated. These wound systems are customizable and are excellent at controlling abdominal fluid.</p><p>The general mechanism of action of NPWT, its clinical uses and contraindications, and placement and management of the device are discussed in detail elsewhere. The effectiveness of using NPWT in the management of the open abdomen is discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=negative-pressure-wound-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Negative pressure wound therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The essential differences between towel-based and sponge-based negative pressure systems are described briefly below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41357434\"><span class=\"h4\">Towel-based</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Towel-based negative pressure systems (&quot;Barker's VAC&quot;) use a surgical towel adhered to a polyethylene sheet (eg, Ioban) that is placed between the viscera and posterior aspect of the anterior abdominal wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55934\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55934 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67674\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67674 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. Small slit perforations are made in the elastic drape to allow transfer of fluid out of the abdomen. Drain tubing is placed over the towel to capture the fluid and is connected to a closed-suction drainage system. An outer, adherent elastic layer is placed to cover the abdominal wall defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/29,31,32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31,32,34</a>]. </p><p>Towel-based system dressings are easy to apply and inexpensive. Although the system effectively controls abdominal fluid, it does not provide effective suction throughout the abdomen, and thus, fluid can accumulate within the abdominal cavity. However, mild increases in intraabdominal volume can be accommodated without resulting in increased intraabdominal pressure because the system is relatively compliant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41357441\"><span class=\"h4\">Sponge-based</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commercially available kits (Ab-Thera and VAC therapy) contain a perforated silastic sheet to place between the bowel and abdominal wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109366\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109366 \">picture 3</a>). A sponge is trimmed and used to fill the subcutaneous abdominal defect and an outer self-adherent skin drape contains a suction port that is connected to a proprietary suction device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79627\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79627 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Sponge-based systems are more expensive than the towel-based negative pressure system discussed above but provide more uniform suction throughout the peritoneal cavity, and may be more effective in preventing intraabdominal fluid accumulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41357998\"><span class=\"h3\">Silo techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Silo techniques involve suturing a large, sterilized translucent bag to the abdominal fascia or skin. A Bogota Bag (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77077\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77077 \">picture 5</a>), intravenous, dialysate, or irrigation bag can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The technique is simple, low cost, and the translucent bag allows visual inspection of the abdominal viscera. However, the technique is more time-consuming compared with other techniques, fluid losses are difficult to control, and increased intra-abdominal pressure requires upsizing of the system, which requires operative replacement with a larger bag. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41357891\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin-only closures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin-only closures using towel clamps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57668\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57668 \">picture 6</a>) or staples to reapproximate the skin were the first described methods for temporary closure of the abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">wall/skin</span>. </p><p>The disadvantages of skin-only closure are that it does not control fluid from the wound, the technique introduces artifacts into radiographic studies, and abdominal compartment syndrome can occur (or recur). Given other, more superior options, we avoid skin-only closure, whenever possible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170878938\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjunctive techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other adjunctive techniques may help pull the fascia to the midline and facilitate primary fascial closure. These include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vessel loops placing traction on the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58493\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58493 \">picture 7</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Commercial fascial closure systems (eg, Abdominal Re-approximation and Anchor System [ABRA]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fascial tension sutures (ie, retention sutures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other improvised, noncommercial fascial tension devices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary fascial release (relaxing incisions of the fascia of the oblique musculature)</p><p/><p>An adjunctive technique is usually needed to supplement the suction force delivered by commercial negative pressure systems to counteract the lateral abdominal forces. However, care should be taken to minimize excessive fascial manipulation and tension, which can result in fascial injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255251544\"><span class=\"h2\">Ostomy interference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ostomies often interfere with the placement of temporary abdominal closure devices and, as a result, reduce the rates of primary fascial closure or functional closure. </p><p>A stoma that is matured (opening the blind end of the bowel and suturing to the skin) through the rectus muscle interferes with the placement and function of temporary abdominal closure dressings. Conversely, the abdominal dressing can prevent the proper placement and seal of the stoma appliance leading to leakage of bowel contents onto the open wound. </p><p>To avoid these problems, whenever an ileostomy or colostomy are needed in conjunction with an open abdomen, we prefer to bring the small bowel or colon through the abdominal wall lateral to the rectus abdominus muscle through the oblique muscles, even though the incidence of parastomal hernia may be greater using this placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parastomal-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parastomal hernia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If maturation of the stoma can be delayed for a short period of time (on the order of days), temporary closure tends to be easier and a primary closure or a functional closure is more likely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255250676\"><span class=\"h1\">CARE OF THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following temporary abdominal closure, the patient is monitored in the intensive care unit. Abdominal dressings associated with the closure (adhesive dressings, gauze, negative pressure systems) are changed, as needed, and the abdominal contents inspected every two to three days in the intensive care unit or operating room depending upon the condition of the patient and indication for the open abdomen. Dressings and abdominal inspections are continued until abdominal closure is feasible and safe. </p><p>Excessive fluid administration, particularly crystalloid-based fluids, will hinder fascial closure by contributing to visceral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The optimal fluid resuscitation strategy minimizes net fluid administration and may possibly include the use of colloid or hypertonic solutions, which may minimize interstitial and bowel edema. One retrospective study found a significant decrease in time to fascial closure in patients who received 3% hypertonic saline rather than isotonic crystalloids as their maintenance fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Although diuretics can reduce intravascular volume, they do not expedite fascial closure, probably due to a slower mobilization of fluid from the interstitial space to the vascular space following damage control surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Many patients remain intubated due to the severity of illness that led to the need for the open abdomen; however, the presence of an open abdomen does not mandate mechanical ventilation. If the patient needs to return to the operating room for a second look, washout, or other surgical procedure, the decision to have the patient remain intubated in the interim or to extubate the patient depends on multiple factors (eg, comorbidities, associated injuries). </p><p>The intubated patient with an open abdomen does not need to be deeply sedated or paralyzed; spontaneous breathing on the ventilator can be allowed. Light sedation (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale [RASS] score between -2 to 0 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57874 \">table 1</a>)) should be sufficient to keep the temporary abdominal dressing in place and prevent evisceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, forceful Valsalva efforts, as can occur with severe agitation or delirium, may disrupt a temporary abdominal closure potentially leading to evisceration. These patients may need to be more deeply sedated to maintain the dressings. Once the patient no longer requires frequent operative intervention, the patient can be weaned from the ventilator. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Early mobilization of critically ill patients improves outcomes, but mobilizing a patient with an open abdomen has been untested. Anecdotally speaking, mobilization of the patient must be balanced with the risk of disrupting the temporary dressing. Unlike negative pressure wound dressings elsewhere, a temporary abdominal closure dressing that becomes disrupted can result in evisceration necessitating immediate revision of the dressing and potential injury to the bowel.</p><p>The patient is returned to the operating room, typically every two to three days. There are no data to support a specific interval and every clinical situation is different. A shorter interval between operative interventions may be physiologically challenging for the patient, whereas longer intervals may allow the formation of adhesions increasing the risk of bowel injury. Methods to limit the severity of adhesions are discussed elsewhere; however, a randomized trial found that implantation of a hyaluronate-based adhesion barrier significantly decreased the degree and tenacity of adhesions in patients who required five or more take-back operations prior to definitive abdominal wall closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The same study also found that the probability of developing dense adhesions differed significantly between the two arms nine days following initial operation. The study did not find any difference in probability of obtaining fascial closure, method of closure used, or other wound characteristics between the two groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative peritoneal adhesions in adults and their prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Assuming no contraindications (eg, ileus), enteral nutrition is permissible with an open abdomen and temporary abdominal closure dressings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, the need for repeated return to the operating room frequently leads to holding tube feeds and nutritional goals may not be met. Under these circumstances, a combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition may be needed. Use of a volume-based, as opposed to rate-based, strategy to administer tube feeds may improve daily delivery of prescribed calories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This strategy mandates that patients receive a fixed volume of tube feeds per day, thereby allowing the rate to increase for the hours in which a patient's feeds are held.</p><p>Regardless of the method used to obtain temporary abdominal closure, the ongoing loss of peritoneal fluid is associated with a net loss of protein. The protein content of peritoneal fluid is approximately 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Because the total daily volume of fluid removed can be over 1 L, the net loss of protein per day can lead to protein-calorie malnutrition. Thus, the amount of protein-based calories provided to patients with an open abdomen should be increased to take this loss into account. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of perioperative nutritional support&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632146444\"><span class=\"h1\">ABDOMINAL CLOSURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452284\"><span class=\"h2\">Fascial closure techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideal management of the open abdomen results in closure that brings the edges of the abdominal fascia together primarily (primary closure).

However, the late incidence of ventral hernia following primary fascial closure for open abdomen can be as high as 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>Because of the high hernia rate, biologic mesh reinforcement during primary fascial closure is frequently used. Permanent mesh is contraindicated if there are risk factors for mesh infection (eg, wound soilage). A component separation of the abdominal wall layers can also be used to provide fascial apposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Techniques for ventral hernia repair are discussed elsewhere.

The biologic mesh serves as a scaffold that is repopulated with host cells, which creates new native fascial tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. Once the biologic mesh is placed, the skin is closed over surgical drains placed into the subcutaneous space. Functional closure is not recommended if the skin cannot be closed over the biologic mesh layer because exposed mesh is at risk for accelerated degradation and infection until a granulation tissue layer forms over the biologic mesh, which is a slow process that can take weeks.</p><p>The late incidence of ventral hernia for functional abdominal closure to manage open abdomen has not been determined. One study that used acellular dermal matrix for ventral hernia repair noted an 80 percent hernia incidence over a mean follow-up of 21.4 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>In a review of 37 patients, abdominal closure using a human acellular dermal matrix was possible in all patients who had an open abdomen for damage control indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. These authors noted no complications when closure was performed &quot;early&quot;; early was not defined directly by the authors but the mean duration of open abdomen in this study was 21 days. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452455\"><span class=\"h3\">Planned ventral hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If primary fascial closure or functional closure cannot be achieved, then planned ventral hernia is the only option. Skin coverage over abdominal viscera can be accomplished in one of two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin-only closure &ndash; A skin-only closure approximates the skin over the fascial defect leaving a ventral hernia. Primary skin closure requires close observation to watch for wound disruption that might lead to evisceration. Skin-only closure may also be associated with an increased rate of surgical site infection associated with the use of damage control techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>] (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-abdominal-wall-closure#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of abdominal wall closure&quot;, section on 'Skin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Split-thickness skin graft &ndash; If the skin cannot be approximated, the viscera within the wound are allowed to adhere to each other and to the abdominal wall. Once the abdominal contents have &quot;solidified&quot; and there is a healthy bed of granulation tissue overlying the bowel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70333\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70333 \">picture 8</a>), a split-thickness skin graft can be placed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78618\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78618 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Occasionally, an absorbable (eg, Vicryl) mesh is sutured to the skin to prevent evisceration while awaiting granulation. Before elective hernia repair is attempted, 6 to 12 months are generally allowed to elapse following placement of a split-thickness skin graft. The interval of time allows maturation and dissolution of abdominal adhesions with a lower incidence of enterotomy during hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

In a study that compared early closure (&lt;7 days) versus late closure (&gt;7 days), those in the early group had less daily pain, better quality-of-life scores, and were more likely to return to work (54 versus 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In a review of 499 patients, primary fascial closure occurred in 327 patients (65.5 percent). Increasing time to the first take-back was associated with a decreased likelihood of primary fascial closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Each hour delay after 24 hours was associated with a 1.1 percent decrease in the chance for primary closure. In addition, there was a trend towards increased intraabdominal complications in patients returning after 48&nbsp;hours. Although these studies were not randomized and the results may be due to self-selection, earlier rather than later closure of the abdominal wall is the goal. </p><p>Each time the patient is returned to the operating room, the abdomen should be assessed for potential closure. If closure cannot be performed, the temporary abdominal closure dressing is replaced with the fascial edges brought together as closely as possible and a return to the operating room planned in another 48 hours. In a review of 344 trauma patients with an open abdomen for damage control, abdominal fascial closure was achieved in 63 percent of the patients at the second-look procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The need for ongoing fluid resuscitation or the development of a systemic inflammatory response will delay the time for fascial approximation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. Fascial closure may not be possible under these circumstances. Generally speaking, the longer the abdomen remains open, the less likely primary fascial or functional closure will be achieved. With time, the fascia retracts further from the midline and the underlying bowel becomes adherent to the peritoneal cavity. Complications also increase as the interval from initial operative intervention to attempted closure increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

As an example, a retrospective review evaluating 104 patients found significantly higher primary fascial closure rates for negative pressure (vacuum-assisted) systems compared with those that provided no form of abdominal tension (78 versus 44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In the above systematic review, the addition of fascial traction via mesh or sutures (six studies) increased the closure rates associated with negative pressure wound therapy to 73 percent (range 63 to 81 percent) compared with negative pressure therapy alone at 52 percent (range 47 to 56 percent; 32 studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Another study, a multicenter, prospective, observational study (NCT01016353) involving 280 patients at 20 sites, compared towel-based (Barker, 102 patients) and sponge-based (Ab-Thera, 178 patients) techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

All-cause 30-day mortality was also significantly higher for the towel-based group (30 versus 14 percent), potentially related to increased fluid resuscitation requirements and development of multiorgan dysfunction in this group in spite of initially similar disease severity. This is the first study to suggest a difference in survival between two differing temporary abdominal closure techniques. The authors speculate that the sponge-based system may be more efficient at removing fluid, rich in inflammatory cytokines, from the abdomen. Further study will be needed to confirm these data.</p><p>Studies evaluating dynamic fascial closure with or without other techniques reported primary closure rates of 61 to 91 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>].

Open abdomen is often created intentionally by leaving an abdominal incision open at the completion of surgery or by opening (or re-opening) the abdomen because of abdominal compartment syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H632146272\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H632146279\" class=\"local\">'Open abdomen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open abdomen leads to fluid and protein losses. With prolonged open abdomen, bowel fistulization and loss of abdominal domain can complicate management. The main goal of temporary abdominal closure techniques is to control fluid losses and minimize the loss of domain. (See <a href=\"#H255249176\" class=\"local\">'Complications of open abdomen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several techniques for temporary abdominal closure are available, including patch closure, negative pressure systems (towel- and sponge-based), and silo closure. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages with respect to their ability to control fluid loss, frequency of dressing changes, minimizing loss of domain, ease of use, and cost. (See <a href=\"#H15191189\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following temporary abdominal closure, the patient is monitored in the intensive care unit. Abdominal dressings associated with the closure (adhesive dressings, gauze, negative pressure systems) are changed, as needed, and the abdominal contents inspected every two to three days in the intensive care unit or operating room depending upon the condition of the patient and indication for the open abdomen. Dressings and abdominal inspections are continued until abdominal closure is feasible and safe. (See <a href=\"#H255250676\" class=\"local\">'Care of the patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Wittmann Patch has the highest average rate of primary fascial closure compared with other techniques in observational studies. However, this temporary closure technique, when used alone, does not adequately manage fluid loss. (See <a href=\"#H170879412\" class=\"local\">'Rates of primary fascial closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest using a negative pressure system (sponge or towel based) to control and quantify fluid loss (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Negative pressure systems can be used alone, or in conjunction with other temporary abdominal closure techniques. Although the applied negative pressure counteracts some of the lateral forces responsible for loss of abdominal domain, additional adjunctive techniques may be needed to help bring the fascial edges to the midline to improve the rates of primary closure. (See <a href=\"#H632146335\" class=\"local\">'Negative pressure wound systems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the indication for the open abdomen has resolved, the abdomen is closed, preferably with a primary fascial closure. If primary fascial closure cannot be achieved, functional closure can be performed using a biologic mesh in-lay technique which generates new fascial tissue between the native fascial edges; however, the risk of subsequent hernia with this technique is high. If the gap between the fascial edges is too wide for a functional closure, primary skin closure can be performed, or skin grafts placed to cover the fascial defect once a layer of granulation tissue has developed over the consolidated visceral mass.
