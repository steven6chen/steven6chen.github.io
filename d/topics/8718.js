People with ITP can bruise or bleed much more easily than normal.</p><p>ITP causes low platelets. Platelets are cells that are normally found in the blood that help blood to clot. People with ITP have fewer platelets than normal. That's because their immune system destroys their platelets. The immune system is the body's infection-fighting system.</p><p>Both adults and children can get ITP, but ITP is more common in children. Children who get ITP usually get it after they have an infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6630370\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ITP?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with ITP have no symptoms. When people do have symptoms, they can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleed easily &ndash; This can include nosebleeds or blood-filled blisters inside the mouth. Women with ITP can bleed more than usual during their monthly periods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruise easily &ndash; This could look like large bruises or tiny bruise-like dots on the feet and ankles.</p><p/><p>Sometimes, there can be more serious bleeding, like bleeding in the brain or inside the body.</p><p>In children, symptoms usually start suddenly. In adults, symptoms can start slowly or suddenly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6630385\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for ITP?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes and no. There is a test for the number of platelets in the blood, called the &quot;platelet count.&quot; This is often done as part of a &quot;complete blood count&quot; (or &quot;CBC&quot;). If your platelet count is low, ITP might be the cause. But there is no test that can tell for sure if a person has ITP.</p><p>If a blood test shows that a person has a low platelet count, the doctor will do an exam and ask about symptoms. This is to help figure out if another condition is causing the low platelet count. In children, ITP is the most common cause of a low platelet count, and other tests might not be needed. In adults, sometimes other tests are needed. For example, doctors sometimes do a test called a bone marrow biopsy. The bone marrow is the cells inside your bones. It makes all of the blood cells and platelets. During a bone marrow biopsy, a doctor or nurse takes a tiny sample of bone marrow. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope.</p><p>If the doctor can't find another cause for a low platelet count, the person is usually said to have ITP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6630399\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ITP treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for ITP depends on the person's age, symptoms, and how low the platelet count is.</p><p>Children with ITP do not need treatment unless they have a lot of bleeding or have a very low platelet count. For most children, ITP goes away on its own within 6 months. But doctors follow children with ITP closely to make sure the ITP does not get worse or end up needing treatment.</p><p>Adults with mild ITP do not usually need treatment. But adults with a very low platelet count or bleeding will most likely need treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults who need treatment are first treated with medicines called steroids. (These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.) Even though steroids can help treat ITP, they can also cause problems of their own. The doctor will talk to you about the possible side effects of steroids. If the ITP doesn't get better with steroids, doctors can use other treatments. These include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A medicine called intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">immune globulin</a> (or &quot;IVIG&quot;) &ndash; This medicine stops the body from destroying platelets. Children who need treatment for their ITP are treated with IVIG before they are treated with steroids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgery to remove the spleen &ndash; The spleen is an organ in the body's immune system that helps protect the body from infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61816\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61816 \">figure 1</a>). But sometimes the spleen can attack normal cells of the body, like platelets. If the spleen is removed, the body might stop destroying platelets.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines that can help the body make more platelets</p><p/><p>If these treatments don't work, other treatments are available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6630414\"><span class=\"h1\">What else might people with ITP need to do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on their platelet count and symptoms, people with ITP might need to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid certain sports or activities &ndash; It's very important for children to limit their physical activity and not play certain sports, especially contact sports. That's because children can get hurt by accident. If a person with a very low platelet count gets hurt, he or she can bleed a lot. The doctor will tell you which activities and sports your child should avoid. Adults might also need to limit their activities and sports. People can do their usual sports and activities again when their ITP gets better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid taking certain medicines &ndash; Some medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, affect blood clotting. Your doctor will let you know which prescription and over-the-counter medicines to avoid.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6630429\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have ITP and want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have ITP and want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse. Most women with ITP have a normal pregnancy and delivery.</p><p>There is a very small chance that your baby will have a low platelet count after he or she is born. A doctor will decide if the baby's blood needs to be tested. If the baby has a low platelet count, it will get better on its own in a few days. But it can get worse before it gets better, so it is important to check the baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6630444\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=complete-blood-count-cbc-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Complete blood count (CBC) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=splenectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Splenectomy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heavy-or-prolonged-menstrual-bleeding-menorrhagia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
