VZV is a member of the herpesvirus family, along with herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human herpesvirus (HHV) -6, -7, and -8.</p><p>Varicella usually is a mild, self-limited illness in healthy children. Rarely, varicella affects the pregnant or postpartum woman, causing problems for the fetus or newborn. Nosocomial acquisition of VZV also can occur in newborns.</p><p>Varicella-zoster infection in the newborn is reviewed her. Chickenpox and VZV infection in pregnancy are reviewed separately.

However, the overall risk of vertical transmission is quite small compared with other viruses acquired during pregnancy. The risk appears to be approximately 2 percent if the infection occurs before 20 weeks and &lt;1 percent if it occurs before 13 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Newborns born to mothers who are exposed to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) or have clinical disease manifestations within two weeks of delivery are at the greatest risk for infection. Nosocomial acquisition of VZV also can occur.</p><p>The case fatality rate is increased when the mother develops symptoms of varicella infection from five days before to two days after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This interval allows insufficient time for the development of maternal IgG and passive transfer of antibody protection to the fetus. Postnatally acquired varicella that occurs between 10 and 28 days after birth usually is mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, because of their relative immunologic immaturity, newborns are at greater risk for acquiring severe disease than are older infants or children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Premature infants are at increased risk for nosocomial acquisition of VZV compared with infants born at term because active transfer of maternal IgG antibodies occurs primarily during the third trimester of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Postnatal age also is a risk factor because antibody levels decline with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In one report of VZV exposure in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), seronegativity occurred frequently in infants older than two months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical picture of neonatal varicella is variable, ranging from a mild illness resembling chickenpox in older children to a disseminated infection similar to manifestations seen in immunocompromised hosts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-chickenpox#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of varicella-zoster virus infection: Chickenpox&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p>Fever may develop within the first days after birth, followed by a generalized vesicular eruption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55533 \">picture 2</a>). The rash starts as macules and rapidly progresses to papules and then to characteristic vesicular lesions before crusting. It usually appears first on the head and then generalizes. The lesions characteristically are in various stages of development and healing. The generalized involvement and appearance of lesions in different stages of development distinguish varicella from the vesicular rash seen in neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV), which tends to occur in localized clusters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75059\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75059 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Skin, eye, mouth (SEM) disease'</a>.)</p><p>In mild cases of neonatal varicella, the lesions heal within 7 to 10 days. However, disseminated disease may ensue, with varicella pneumonia, hepatitis, and meningoencephalitis being the most common visceral manifestations. Reports of neonatal herpes zoster in babies born to mothers with varicella during pregnancy are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p>Prompt administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-immune-globulin-human-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">varicella-zoster immune globulin</a> (ie, VariZIG) to infants born to women with active varicella infection at delivery may ameliorate neonatal disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Postexposure prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of neonatal varicella can be made clinically based upon the characteristic appearance of generalized vesicular skin lesions in various stages of development and healing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55533 \">picture 2</a>) in an infant born to a mother exposed to VZV or with clinical symptoms close to the time of delivery. In uncertain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe cases, the diagnosis is confirmed by detection of the virus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is the test of choice for diagnosis of neonatal varicella because it is highly sensitive and specific. PCR can detect VZV from vesicular swabs or scrapings, scabs from crusted lesions, tissue from biopsy samples, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebral spinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It can also distinguish between wild VZV and vaccine strains. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus infection&quot;, section on 'Polymerase chain reaction'</a>.)</p><p>Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) on scrapings from active vesicular skin lesions can provide a rapid diagnosis. However, DFA should not be used in lieu of PCR testing since PCR is more sensitive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus infection&quot;, section on 'Direct fluorescent antibody'</a>.)</p><p>Viral culture is not helpful in making the diagnosis since it has a much lower sensitivity compared with PCR and the virus takes several weeks to grow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus infection&quot;, section on 'Viral culture'</a>.)</p><p>Serologic testing can help establish the diagnosis. However, this approach requires acute and convalescent titers and therefore it is not helpful for rapidly establishing the diagnosis. In neonatal varicella infection, acute and convalescent sera demonstrate a rise in VZV IgG titers. In contrast, uninfected neonates who received passive transfer of maternal antibodies during pregnancy typically have low acute VZV titers and convalescent titers remain low. VZV IgM is insensitive in newborns and false positives can occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus infection&quot;, section on 'Serologic testing'</a>.) </p><p>Other diagnostic tests, including fluorescent anti-membrane antibody (FAMA), latex agglutination (LA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and complement-enhanced neutralization, are available but are not recommended in neonates. </p><p>Prenatal diagnosis of fetal varicella infection is possible.

The specific intervention depends upon the timing of exposure, the mother's serologic status, and gestational age. Varicella vaccination, which is used for prevention in older children and adults, has not been tested for this purpose in newborns.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of neonatal VZV infection can be made clinically based upon the characteristic appearance of generalized vesicular skin lesions in various stages of development and healing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55533 \">picture 2</a>) in an infant born to a mother exposed to VZV or with clinical symptoms close to the time of delivery. In uncertain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe cases, the diagnosis is confirmed by detection of the virus by PCR from vesicular swabs or scrapings, scabs from crusted lesions, tissue from biopsy samples, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebral spinal fluid. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) on scrapings from active vesicular skin lesions can provide a rapid diagnosis. However, DFA should not be used in lieu of PCR testing since PCR is more sensitive. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postexposure prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-immune-globulin-human-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">varicella-zoster immune globulin</a> (VariZIG) is recommended for infants born to symptomatic mothers around the time of delivery (ie, from five days before to two days after delivery); preterm infants with gestational age (GA) &ge;28 weeks born to mothers without immunity, and preterm infants &lt;28 weeks. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'VariZIG'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mothers with active disease or those who are seronegative with a history of exposure 6 to 21 days before admission must be isolated from other patients including their infants. The newborn is isolated from the mother until she is no longer infectious. Any infant who develops varicella is isolated from other infants. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Isolation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For newborns with severe disseminated VZV infection (eg, pneumonia, encephalitis, thrombocytopenia, severe hepatitis), we recommend antiviral therapy rather than supportive care alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). These infants are at high risk of morbidity and mortality without antiviral therapy. Treatment consists of a 10-day course of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acyclovir</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in 3 divided doses). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Acyclovir'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfeeding is encouraged in infants exposed to or infected with varicella. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Breastfeeding'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Pastuszak AL, Levy M, Schick B, et al.
