Acutely febrile HIV-infected children who are well controlled by combination antiretroviral therapy often have illness that is mild and self-limited. Not all of these patients require diagnostic testing or antibiotic therapy. However, a few of these children have more serious infectious diseases. Differentiating these seriously ill patients from the larger group of mildly ill children can be difficult. HIV-infected children with prolonged fever often have complicating medical conditions, and the diagnostic evaluation can be complex.</p><p>An approach to the evaluation of fever in HIV-infected children is reviewed here. The epidemiology, classification, clinical manifestations, and outcome of pediatric HIV are discussed separately.

Alternative terms are fever without localizing signs (FWLS) or fever without a focus.

In adolescents with acute HIV infection, fever may be a sign of acute retroviral syndrome.

In a study investigating reasons for hospital admission among 6182 children living with HIV (from 2007 to 2015), bacterial infections were the most common cause, accounting for 41 percent of admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-hiv-infected-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The incidence of serious bacterial infections in HIV-infected children has decreased substantially in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). In a prospective observational study of 235 HIV-infected children maintained on cART, the incidence of serious bacterial infections was of 3.66 per 100 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-hiv-infected-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>With the advent of cART, the incidence of pneumonia has decreased to a rate similar to that in HIV-uninfected children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-hiv-infected-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The character and duration of symptoms, HIV disease status (including most recent CD4 count), adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and history of recent exposures to ill contacts are of particular relevance. The physical examination should include a careful search for signs of focal infection or inflammation, and the patient should be assessed generally for illness severity or &quot;toxicity.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94725231\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic HIV disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For HIV-infected children who are well controlled by combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with stable CD4 counts above the threshold for immunodeficiency, the diagnostic approach is generally the same as in HIV-uninfected children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Overview of evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94725259\"><span class=\"h2\">Advanced HIV disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with advanced HIV disease (ie, CD4 count &lt;15 percent), a broad array of possible etiologies must be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Focal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of focal infection in HIV-infected children are similar to the features observed in immunologically normal children. Fever and local signs of inflammation often are present. It is desirable, but not always feasible, to obtain cultures from the site of infection for accurate bacteriologic diagnosis and exclusion of other etiologic agents (eg, fungi).</p><p>Bacteremia should be suspected in ill-appearing children and those with serious focal infections (eg, pneumonia, cellulitis, or osteomyelitis). Routine bacterial blood cultures should be obtained from all such children.

A substantial percentage of these children are bacteremic despite appearing well. An individualized approach is necessary to determine who warrants diagnostic laboratory studies. The extensive literature on identifying occult bacteremia in immunologically normal children with FWS is not applicable to children with advanced HIV disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, for the evaluation of children with advanced HIV and FWS, we obtain diagnostic testing as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>White blood cell count</strong> &mdash; A white blood cell count (WBC) is typically obtained to assess likelihood of serious infection; however, WBC has a poor sensitivity for detecting serious bacterial illness in HIV-infected children when thresholds for immunocompetent patients are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-hiv-infected-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. We therefore recommend interpreting WBC in relation to the patient's baseline values, rather than adhering to a fixed threshold. In a retrospective study of 54 HIV-infected children with pneumococcal bacteremia, the sensitivity of elevated WBC in predicting bacteremia was 40 percent for WBC <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;15,000/microL</span> and 75 percent for WBC <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;10,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-hiv-infected-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood culture</strong> &mdash; We obtain blood cultures in any ill-appearing child and in well-appearing children if the rectal temperature is &gt;39.4&ordm;C or if the WBC is elevated (relative to baseline). In the retrospective study mentioned above, of the 54 HIV-infected children with pneumococcal bacteremia, nearly half had occult infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-hiv-infected-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urinalysis and urine culture</strong> &mdash; Urinalysis and urine culture may be indicated in some febrile children to exclude occult urinary tract infection (UTI).

Clinicians should apply clinical judgment in deciding when to perform an LP using the same considerations that apply in HIV-negative children.

Some of the more important causes of FUO in HIV-infected children are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81833 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The broad spectrum of potential infectious and noninfectious causes for FUO necessitates meticulous physical examination and often extensive diagnostic testing. Such studies may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest and sinus radiographs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood cultures for routine bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral cultures of appropriate specimens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum cryptococcal and other fungal antigen tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver enzyme measurements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ophthalmologic examination for chorioretinitis</p><p/><p>We typically perform lumbar puncture and perform the following tests on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): routine cell counts; protein and glucose concentrations; bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral studies; cryptococcal antigen tests and cytology.</p><p>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may be warranted if an etiology is not identified through less invasive testing. Specimens should be obtained for Gram stain and bacterial culture, fungal stains and culture, stains for acid-fast bacteria, mycobacterial culture, viral culture, histopathology, and cytology.</p><p>High-resolution abdominal ultrasonography also may be warranted. FUO has been associated with microabscesses in the liver or spleen of HIV-infected patients in some studies. Etiologies include tuberculosis, visceral leishmaniasis, disseminated <em>Mycobacterium avium</em>, <em>Pneumocystis carinii (jirovecii)</em>, <em>Bartonella henselae</em>, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-hiv-infected-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The breadth and pace of the diagnostic evaluation for FUO generally is determined by the pace of the illness. In the case of a child who appears only mildly ill, diagnostic studies are prioritized and conducted in a stepwise manner with common causes of disease excluded first. A patient with more fulminant illness may require immediate and extensive testing to address the full range of diagnostic possibilities.

The selection of antibiotics for empiric or expectant therapy is influenced by several factors, including the nature of the infection (eg, presumed bacterial meningitis, pneumonia), the clinical scenario (eg, community-acquired versus hospital-acquired infection), the child's HIV disease status, and how ill the child appears. Guidelines for prevention and treatment of bacterial infections in HIV-infected children are available through <a href=\"https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/5/pediatric-opportunistic-infection/397/bacterial-infections&amp;token=8Hh/dciH1NTPKduf2YV5wFtSYHPR3kTuFzlqRhdazA9TelVfSDTHxQArWiTmuoVvoB4ggSWTo89PmKEUkpyhXryRDhBivSBwvMVjwK1pAtPzGZdkDbT+O+CEZA9ocIN5&amp;TOPIC_ID=5964\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">AIDSinfo</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94726055\"><span class=\"h3\">Aims of empiric therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of <span class=\"nowrap\">empiric/expectant</span> antibiotic therapy is to provide coverage against likely pathogens (ie, <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, <em>S. aureus</em>); it is not feasible to include coverage for every conceivable pathogen. Empiric therapy usually is directed only against potential bacterial pathogens. Unless there is convincing clinical or laboratory evidence of serious opportunistic fungal or viral infection, empiric therapy for these organisms is not indicated. Similarly, if pneumocystis pneumonia&nbsp;(PCP) is suspected, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis should be pursued, if possible, before therapy is instituted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic HIV disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, empiric antibiotic therapy for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV-infected children with fever should be similar to the routine coverage provided to HIV-uninfected children with comparable clinical presentations and should be tailored according to the most likely pathogens.

Acutely febrile HIV-infected children who are well controlled by combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) often have illness that is mild and self-limited. Not all of these patients require diagnostic testing or antibiotic therapy. However, a few of these children have more serious infectious diseases. Differentiating these seriously ill patients from the larger group of mildly ill children can be difficult. HIV-infected children with prolonged fever often have complicating medical conditions, and the diagnostic evaluation can be complex. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial infections, particularly bacterial pneumonia, are the most common serious infections in HIV-infected patients. <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> are the most commonly isolated organisms. The rate of serious bacterial infections in HIV-infected children has decreased substantially in the era of cART. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology of fever'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic evaluation begins with a thorough medical history and physical examination. The character and duration of symptoms, HIV disease status, adherence to antiretroviral therapy, history of recent exposures to ill contacts, signs of focal <span class=\"nowrap\">infection/inflammation,</span> and assessment of illness severity are of particular relevance. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with <span class=\"nowrap\">asymptomatic/mildly</span> symptomatic HIV disease who are well controlled by cART with stable CD4 counts above the threshold for immunodeficiency, the diagnostic approach is generally the same as in HIV-uninfected children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with advanced HIV disease (ie, CD4 count &lt;15 percent) and evidence of focal infection, bacteriologic diagnosis by culture is desirable whenever it is possible. Blood cultures should be obtained in children who are ill-appearing and those with serious focal infections (eg, pneumonia, cellulitis, or osteomyelitis). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Focal infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with advanced HIV disease who present with fever without a source (FWS), we obtain white blood cell count (WBC), blood cultures (if the rectal temperature is &gt;39.4&ordm;C, the WBC is elevated compared with baseline, or the child is ill-appearing), and chest radiograph. In addition, lumbar puncture and urine culture may be warranted to exclude serious bacterial infection. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'FWS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever of unknown origin (FUO) in HIV-infected children is associated with a broad spectrum of potential infectious and noninfectious causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81833 \">table 1</a>). Meticulous physical examination and diagnostic testing are necessary for specific diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'FUO'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most febrile children with HIV infection, empiric and expectant antibiotic therapy considerations are similar to those in HIV-uninfected children. However, children with advanced HIV disease, neutropenia, or nosocomial infection usually require broader initial antibiotic coverage. If a bacterial pathogen is isolated, <span class=\"nowrap\">empiric/expectant</span> antibiotic therapy can be targeted more narrowly. The duration of antibiotic therapy generally is similar to that for comparable infections in immunologically normal children. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Empiric antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expectant antibiotic therapy rarely is indicated in HIV-infected children with FUO; if expectant antibiotic therapy is planned, relevant diagnostic studies ideally should be obtained before its institution. (See <a href=\"#H94726151\" class=\"local\">'Fever of unknown origin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adherence to the HIV-specific recommended immunization schedule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93622%7EID%2F93621\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93622 graphicRef93621 \">figure 1A-B</a>) is the most important intervention to prevent serious bacterial infections in HIV-infected children.
