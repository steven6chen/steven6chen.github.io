But if the body accidentally lets these things into the lungs, they can do 1 or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage the lung tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cause an infection (called &quot;pneumonia&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Block an airway</p><p/><p>Some people are more likely to get aspiration pneumonia, such as those who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are sleepy from surgery or have passed out from alcohol or drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have problems with swallowing, for example because of a stroke or brain damage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have certain conditions affecting their stomach or esophagus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5551171\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of aspiration pneumonia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend partly on what's causing the aspiration pneumonia. They can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cough &ndash; People might cough up mucus that smells bad, or is yellow or green or bloody.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing or catching your breath</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fast breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noisy breathing (wheezing)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bluish-looking lips or skin</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5551186\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Call your doctor or nurse if you have the symptoms listed above, especially if they started after you choked on food or drink.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5551201\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. To look for a problem in your lungs, he or she might do 1 or more of the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan of your chest &ndash; This is an imaging test that can create pictures of the inside of your body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests &ndash; These can include blood or urine tests, or tests on a sample of the mucus you cough up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoscopy &ndash; This is a procedure in which a doctor puts a thin tube with a camera on the end (called a &quot;bronchoscope&quot;) in your mouth and down into your airways. Then he or she can look inside your airways and lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to check for swallowing problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5551218\"><span class=\"h1\">How is aspiration pneumonia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your symptoms and what's causing your aspiration pneumonia. Most people need to be treated in the hospital, at least at first.</p><p>If you have an infection, your doctor will treat it with antibiotic medicines. These medicines usually go into a vein through a thin tube, called an &quot;IV.&quot; The antibiotic your doctor chooses will depend on the kind of bacteria causing your infection.</p><p>If an object is blocking your airway, your doctor can try to remove the object during bronchoscopy.</p><p>If a harmful substance damaged your lungs, your doctor can use a suction device to suck out liquid from your lungs.</p><p>Some people with aspiration pneumonia need extra oxygen. Your doctor will give you extra oxygen if you are not getting enough oxygen when you breathe normally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5551233\"><span class=\"h1\">Can aspiration pneumonia be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. Some people with long-term swallowing problems can help prevent aspiration pneumonia by changing what and how they eat and drink. If your doctor recommends making these changes, he or she will have you work with a speech therapist who has experience in this area. Another way to help prevent aspiration pneumonia is to raise the head of your bed, or sleep on extra pillows, so you aren't lying flat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5551248\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coughing-up-blood-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coughing up blood (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
