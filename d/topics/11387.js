These disorders run in families. Some types of muscular dystrophy affect mostly boys. Other types affect both boys and girls.</p><p>The symptoms of most types of muscular dystrophy start in childhood. But other types start in adulthood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539154543\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of muscular dystrophy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of muscular dystrophy differ depending on what type you have. This table lists the most common types of muscular dystrophy and the symptoms they cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61217 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539154550\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for muscular dystrophy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for muscular dystrophy, the doctor might order:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood or other kinds of tests to check for the genes that cause muscular dystrophy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to check for proteins that get released when muscles are damaged</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called &quot;electromyography,&quot; or &quot;EMG.&quot; For this test, the doctor inserts tiny needles into a muscle and passes a gentle electrical current.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A muscle biopsy, which means that the doctor takes a tiny chunk of muscle. That way he or she can look at the muscle cells under a microscope and see if the cells look normal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539154557\"><span class=\"h1\">How is muscular dystrophy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often there are no good treatments for muscular dystrophy. But some types of muscular dystrophy can be treated with medicines called steroids. (These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. These steroids reduce inflammation.) Physical therapy and gentle exercise can be useful for some patients. In addition, braces, wheelchairs, and other devices can help with some of the problems caused by muscular dystrophy.</p><p>A drug called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eteplirsen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">eteplirsen</a> is available in the United States, but it doesn't work for everyone with muscular dystrophy. It might help to increase the muscle protein that is missing in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. But doctors don't know if it actually helps the muscles work better. Also, it can be used only for a small number of people who have a certain type of abnormal gene.</p><p>Some types of muscular dystrophy can cause problems with the heart, lungs, and other organs. For this reason, children who have muscular dystrophy often need to be checked for these problems as they get older. Ask your doctor whether you or your child needs to be checked for any problems over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539154564\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to have children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you or any of your close relatives have muscular dystrophy, ask your doctor or nurse whether you could pass it on to your children. Women can pass on the disorder even if they have no symptoms.</p><p>If you or your partner gets pregnant, it might be possible to have tests before the baby is born to find out if the baby has the disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539154571\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with the muscular dystrophy live fairly long lives. But their physical abilities are often limited. Some types of muscular dystrophy can shorten a person's life. If you or your child has muscular dystrophy, ask your doctor about what to expect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539154578\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-muscular-dystrophies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Overview of muscular dystrophies (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
