Kyphosis tends to progress with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The evaluation and treatment of hyperkyphosis is challenging due to the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria and evidence-based treatment options. Within the last several years, exercise programs, spinal orthotics, and other interventions have been studied that may help delay the progression of age-related kyphosis. However, stronger evidence of efficacy with improved clinical outcomes is needed prior to widespread use of many of these interventions.</p><p>This topic will focus on the etiology, evaluation, and management of hyperkyphosis in older adults. Hyperkyphosis in children and adolescents is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no widely accepted definition of hyperkyphosis, and therefore the prevalence of hyperkyphosis in older persons is not precisely known. Estimates range between 20 and 40 percent among community-dwelling individuals aged &ge;60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of hyperkyphosis increases with age, with the greatest change in the angle of kyphosis occurring among women age 50 to 59 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs are the major anatomical structures that contribute to spinal contour (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65574\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65574 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, any process that affects either supporting structure can lead to hyperkyphosis. Deformities that result in anterior wedge-shaped vertebra will accentuate the angle of kyphosis. As with other age-related conditions, hyperkyphosis occurs as a result of multiple contributing factors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vertebral fractures</strong> &ndash; Vertebral bodies account for the majority of height in the spinal column, and it is commonly believed that age-associated hyperkyphosis mainly results from vertebral fractures. Patients with vertebral fractures have worse kyphosis compared with those without vertebral fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. However, only 36 to 38 percent of older persons with the worst degrees of kyphosis have underlying vertebral fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. Nonetheless, large observational studies report that with each vertebral fracture, kyphosis increases by about 3.7 to 3.8 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Modeling studies have demonstrated that wedge-shaped vertebral fractures increase biomechanical stress and compressive load on adjacent vertebrae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Unlike limb fractures, vertebral fractures represent a continuum of deformity. There is no defined cut-point that distinguishes a vertebral fracture from another deformity that is not due to osteoporosis. In fact, achieving an acceptable level of radiologic agreement in defining a vertebral fracture is challenging. Vertebral compression fractures are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures: Clinical manifestations and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>Low bone density</strong> &ndash; Multiple studies have demonstrated that low bone density, even in the absence of underlying vertebral fractures, contributes to worse kyphosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. Greater rates of bone density loss have been associated with worse kyphosis progression in older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is hypothesized that low bone density may exacerbate the slight wedge shape present in normal thoracic vertebral bodies, in which the height of the anterior side of the vertebra tends to be shorter than the posterior side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Short vertebral height</strong> &ndash; Causes of vertebral deformity other than fractures or osteoporosis are collectively called &quot;non-fracture&quot; deformities. These deformities may be the result of developmental abnormalities with or without degenerative changes. The most common developmental hyperkyphosis is Scheuermann's disease, an inherited kyphotic deformity of the spine that usually occurs in early adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Scheuermann's disease is defined by a thoracic Cobb angle of &gt;45 degrees with anterior vertebral wedging of three or more consecutive vertebrae, end-plate irregularity with Schmorl's nodes and disc space narrowing, and has an estimated population prevalence of 8.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes&quot;, section on 'Scheuermann (juvenile) kyphosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Degenerative disc disease</strong> &ndash; The intervertebral discs in the thoracic spine range from 1 to 2 cm in thickness. With age, the discs can desiccate and lose height, and anterior wedging may occur. There is a significant association between degenerative disc disease and the degree of kyphosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/6,11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postural changes</strong> &ndash; The postural configuration of the cervical, lumbar, and sacral spine may influence thoracic curvature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Subjects with thoracic hyperkyphosis are more likely to have cervical or lumbar lordosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Postural flexibility, which decreases with age, likely contributes to hyperkyphosis. Compared with younger women, women aged 66 years and older had greater flexicurve kyphosis and were less able to actively correct their usual relaxed posture to an erect position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscle weakness</strong> &ndash; It is unclear whether hyperkyphosis precedes or results from muscle weakness. Most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/25-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-32</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>], studies report an inverse correlation between muscle strength and hyperkyphosis. In one study of 189 women age 50 to 80 years, those with weaker back extensor muscles were more likely to have greater kyphosis (58 versus 51 degrees by goniometer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Another study of 1172 older men and women aged 70 to 79 years assessed spinal extensor muscle cross-sectional area and density using computed tomography (CT) and found that lower spinal muscle density was associated with hyperkyphosis (defined as &gt;40 degrees) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intervertebral ligaments</strong> &ndash; With aging, intervertebral ligaments that provide stability to the spine are susceptible to loss of elastic tissue, calcification, and ossification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is diagnosed by the presence of ossification of the ligaments in the anterolateral thoracolumbar spine involving at least four contiguous segments, without evidence of intervertebral disc degeneration. Studies have found that older persons with DISH tend to have greater degrees of thoracic kyphosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Genetic/metabolic</span> conditions</strong> &ndash; Early-onset hyperkyphosis is often observed in inherited genetic conditions including osteogenesis imperfecta, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Marfan syndrome, cystic fibrosis, mucopolysaccharidoses, spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia, and Scheuermann's disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Age-associated hyperkyphosis is most likely a complex inherited trait. In a population-based cohort, investigators found that those who reported a family history of dowager's hump were more likely to have greater kyphosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A twin study comparing monozygotic and dizygotic older twin women reported a significant genetic influence on the degree of thoracic kyphosis, with a heritability estimate of 61 percent (95% CI 46-72) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Analysis of data from the Framingham Study, based on CT images in over 2000 women and men, estimated the hereditable component at 54 percent (95% CI 43-64%) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mouse knock-out and transgenic models suggest that hyperkyphosis may be a common physiologic phenotype that results from mutations involving genes important for DNA repair and delaying senescence. These knock-out mice develop early senescence and often suffer from pronounced hyperkyphosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. In humans, it is commonly believed that poor posture can worsen kyphosis, but kyphotic mice demonstrate that gravitational forces may play a minor role in the development of hyperkyphosis, as mice spend their lives in a prone position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes</strong> &ndash; Other causes of hyperkyphosis that arise in childhood include congenital kyphosis and neurofibromatosis. Later-onset causes can include spondylolisthesis, ankylosing spondylitis, spinal tuberculosis, post laminectomy syndrome, and other complications from spinal surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED HEALTH CONSEQUENCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The health conditions associated with hyperkyphosis are varied. The most important conditions include impairment of lung function, decreased functional capacity, and increased mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired pulmonary function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have shown that increasing kyphosis leads to modest, but predictable, declines in forced vital capacity, as well as other measures of pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>]. In a study of 323 community-dwelling adults age 65 and older, those with hyperkyphosis were more likely to have restrictive ventilatory dysfunction (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.8), obstructive ventilatory dysfunction (OR 3.3, CI 1.7-6.5), and self-reported dyspnea (OR 2.5, CI 1.1-5.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Another study of 56 patients found that, in addition to worse forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume, those with a kyphotic angle &ge;40 degrees had worse duration of exercise than those patients with &lt;40 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Baseline kyphosis severity was associated with a greater decline in FEV1 in women but not in men, in a prospective study over 275 persons aged 50 to 79 years, followed for over 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The lack of effect in men may have been due to the small sample size (n = 82) and survivor bias because the men were more likely to smoke and had higher mortality than women during the time of the study (1970s to 1980s). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chest wall diseases and restrictive physiology&quot;, section on 'Kyphosis and scoliosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diminished physical function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple observational studies suggest that hyperkyphosis is associated with poor physical function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/3,26-28,30,33,34,55-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26-28,30,33,34,55-62</a>]. In studies that have examined muscle strength directly, most have demonstrated a significant negative correlation between kyphosis and back extensor strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/25,27,28,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27,28,33</a>] or grip strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Hyperkyphosis is also associated with worse physical performance functional measurements, including walking speed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/3,57,58,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,57,58,60</a>], the timed get up and go test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/58,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,61</a>], and the standing from a chair test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/59,60,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60,62</a>]. Problems with daily functioning such as dressing oneself, cooking, and bathing have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/55-57,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57,59</a>]. Two prospective studies of kyphosis reported declining function over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Falls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been hypothesized that hyperkyphosis fundamentally alters balance, thus increasing fall risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/28,65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,65,66</a>]. However, several studies have not consistently demonstrated an association between various measures of balance and hyperkyphosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/29,67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,67-69</a>]. Differences in study results may stem from the wide age range of people studied (from just over 50 to 85) to differences in the kyphosis measures and balance assessments used. Alternatively, it may be that with age-related increases in kyphosis, there are compensations in pelvic alignment that serve to stabilize the skeleton such that fall risk is not increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The association between thoracic kyphosis and falls, if present, appears to be minimal, although well-designed prospective studies have yet to be published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/71-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperkyphosis is associated with thoracic vertebral fractures, and it is presumed that the fracture leads to hyperkyphosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/7,75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,75-77</a>]. However, with forward-bent posture, changes in gravitational loads may increase the risk of sustaining a spinal or other osteoporotic fracture.</p><p>In prospective cohort and case-control studies in older women, hyperkyphosis was associated with increased risk of fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/78-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-81</a>]. As an example, in a study of 596 older women followed prospectively over four years, women with hyperkyphosis were at increased risk for future fracture (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0 -3.0) compared with those without hyperkyphosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. A larger study in older women found that a baseline measure of kyphosis was associated with a 50 percent (95% CI 1.10&ndash;2.06) increased risk of future non-spine fracture, and worsening kyphosis was also associated with an increased fracture risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Analyses were adjusted for age, bone mineral density, prior fracture, and prevalent vertebral fractures.</p><p>While the degree of kyphosis has been associated with the incidence of vertebral fracture, this association was no longer significant in a study that adjusted for the prevalence of vertebral fracture, suggesting that hyperkyphosis is a good marker for underlying prevalent vertebral fractures, but that the curvature itself is not independently associated with incident vertebral fracture risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other health-related consequences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age-related hyperkyphosis may be associated with other adverse health effects.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain symptoms, particularly back pain, is associated with hyperkyphosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/7,55,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,55,82</a>].

Until recently, most have assumed that the degree of hyperkyphosis simply represents the severity of underlying vertebral fractures. However, in a prospective cohort of 610 women, each standard deviation increase in kyphosis was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.30) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. This association was adjusted for age, bone mineral density, and prior vertebral fracture, suggesting that low bone density and underlying vertebral fractures were not the only causes for the increased mortality risk.

The degree of kyphosis can be measured clinically or radiographically.</p><p>Clinical methods use devices such as the flexicurve ruler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], goniometer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], inclinometer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], or Debrunner kyphometer (in which a protractor is applied to the upper back) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63165\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63165 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Among these devices, the flexicurve ruler is the least expensive and relatively easy to use. Less precise but more practical clinical measures of kyphosis include: the distance from the occiput-to-wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>], the number of 1.7 cm blocks between the head and exam table while lying flat with the neck in a neutral position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66018\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66018 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and qualitative visual measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The radiologic methods generally use lateral spine radiographs with either manual or computer-assisted calculation of an angle of curvature, termed the Cobb angle. The Cobb angle is measured by drawing perpendicular lines from two lines: (1) a line from the upper border of the vertebral body marking the beginning of the thoracic curve (commonly T4); and (2) a line from the inferior border of the vertebral body representing the interface between the thoracic-lumbar curves (commonly T12). The Cobb angle is then calculated as the angle of intersection of these perpendicular lines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61923\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61923 \">figure 3</a>). Although the Cobb angle was first developed to assess scoliosis angles on spinal radiographs, it was later modified to measure kyphosis and is considered by some to be the gold standard of kyphosis measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Defining hyperkyphosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defining hyperkyphosis is challenging as there are no standardized, age-adjusted reference ranges to distinguish between hyperkyphosis and normal age-related kyphosis.</p><p>In younger persons, normal kyphosis angles range between 20 and 50 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>]. In older adults, the mean kyphotic angle is 48 to 50 degrees in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/6,7,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,76</a>] and 44 degrees in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and continues to increase with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/1,6,22,77,99-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,22,77,99-109</a>]. While there are no widely accepted thresholds for defining hyperkyphosis and many studies use different measurement techniques, several studies have used the cutoff of &ge;40 degrees in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/53,110,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,110,111</a>].</p><p>Ongoing large prospective cohort studies may provide longitudinal data to better define hyperkyphosis.

This topic is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If clinical parameters are used to measure kyphosis, a plain spine radiograph should be performed to rule out underlying osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Ideally, a musculoskeletal radiologist should read the film since interrater reliability in reading vertebral fractures is rather poor, even among skilled radiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. The radiologist should also assess for previously undiagnosed Scheuermann's disease, anterior wedge compression of the intervertebral discs, or other spinal pathologies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no standardized therapies or management guidelines for age-related hyperkyphosis. Most available treatments focus on the rehabilitation of postural abnormalities using exercise therapy. Other less commonly used treatments include spinal orthoses, postural taping, and pharmacologic therapy, as well as surgical approaches. Although randomized trial data are limited for the management of hyperkyphosis, we suggest exercise-based interventions as first-line treatment for hyperkyphosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise-based interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the last several years, there have been many exercise intervention studies assessing effects on thoracic curvature. A systematic review of 13 studies, largely in women, evaluated the effectiveness of exercise on age-related hyperkyphotic posture and found that while eight studies demonstrated improvement in at least one measure of posture, potential study biases (non-blinding and incomplete outcome data) limit the reliability of the findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].</p><p>Examples of some randomized trials demonstrate that exercise improved spine extensor muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>] and physical functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>], while other trials have not found benefit in kyphotic angle measurement. Representative studies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a two-year randomized trial that evaluated the effect of back-strengthening exercises on posture in 60 postmenopausal women, there were no overall differences in either back strength or kyphosis between those randomly assigned to the exercise intervention and those randomly assigned to usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. In a post-hoc pooled analysis, women with substantial kyphosis and the greatest increases in back extensor strength demonstrated a 2.8 degree decrease in kyphotic angle, which is of questionable clinical significance. While the exercise intervention was of adequate duration (two years), major limitations included its small size, non-blinded measurements, and post-hoc subgroup analyses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Yoga for Kyphosis Trial of 118 patients age 60 and older with a kyphosis angle of &ge;40 degrees, those randomly assigned to six months of yoga had no improvement in primary outcomes of Debrunner kyphometer-assessed kyphosis angle, physical performance, or quality of life scores compared with the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].</p><p/><p>In prospective cohort studies, exercise improved kyphosis angle measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/5,111,118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,111,118,119</a>]. However, the degree of improvement is modest and may be measurement-dependent. As an example, in a prospective cohort study of 21 women age 65 years or older with thoracic kyphosis &ge;50 degrees, participants in a 12-week multidimensional group exercise program had significant improvements in kyphosis (6 &plusmn; 3 degrees) and spinal extensor muscle strength (21 &plusmn; 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. In addition to twice weekly flexibility, strengthening, and postural alignment exercises with a physical therapist, patients were also provided motivational interviewing and educational handouts.</p><p>In a follow-up study of 19 of the original 21 participants re-evaluated after one year, these women maintained the improvement in kyphosis, suggesting that educational awareness and exercise training may have long-term beneficial effects in motivated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. Although this study was not randomized and did not include blinded assessments, it was a well-designed pre- and post-intervention study with clearly reported outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal orthosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a wide variety of flexible spinal orthoses (back braces) designed to improve posture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/120-122\" class=\"abstract_t\">120-122</a>]. In addition, spinal orthoses may facilitate stimulation of proprioception to improve unconscious muscle strengthening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p>In a randomized trial of 62 patients with osteoporosis and an angle of kyphosis &ge;60 degrees, those randomly assigned to wearing a spinal orthosis for six months were found to have significantly improved back extensor strength (+189 versus +7 newtons), angle of kyphosis (-7.9 versus -1.6 degrees), and quality of life score (+10.4 versus -2.3 points) compared with those randomly assigned to not wearing the orthosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. However, lack of blinding could have biased the study results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Postural taping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal postural taping may also improve kyphosis. Therapeutic postural taping involves tape applied from the anterior aspect of the acromioclavicular joint, over the muscle bulk of the upper trapezius, and then diagonally towards and just past the spinous process of T6. The tape is applied bilaterally, intersecting at T6. In a study of therapeutic postural taping, control taping, or no taping in 15 women over the age of 50 with vertebral fractures, kyphosis was measured before and after each of three testing conditions done in random order [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. Therapeutic tape significantly decreased kyphosis compared with control taping (5.2 versus 2.1, respectively). While 73 percent of the participants experienced immediate reduction in kyphosis, they did not demonstrate any significant changes in trunk muscle activity or balance parameters. It is unclear whether the immediate effects of therapeutic taping lead to longer-term beneficial effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2286694079\"><span class=\"h2\">Manual therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manual techniques that include massage, mobilization, muscle energy and myofascial release could potentially improve kyphosis, as suggested by a trial in women aged 18 to 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>], but studies in older adults are not available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few data are available showing benefit of pharmacologic therapies in treating hyperkyphosis.</p><p>In the Fracture Intervention Trial of 4432 postmenopausal women with low bone density, those randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> had reduced height loss compared with those randomly assigned to placebo (7.0 versus 8.5 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. However, in a secondary analysis of the Fracture Intervention Trial, there was no benefit of alendronate in delaying kyphosis progression over an average of 4.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p>A study that combined results from two randomized trials reported that treatment with strontium ranelate decreased progression in kyphosis index over three years compared with placebo (3.7 versus 4.7 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. Kyphosis index was defined as the percentage ratio between the maximum depth of thoracic curvature and the height measured from the T4 to the T12 vertebrae. As the difference in kyphosis index progression was only 1 percent, the beneficial effect of strontium on delaying kyphosis progression, if present, is likely of minimal consequence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive surgical interventions for correcting hyperkyphosis are associated with high rates of perioperative complications (33 percent) and are not recommended unless patients develop intractable pain, disability, significant pulmonary function impairment, or progressive neurologic deficits. If surgery is performed, a posterior-only approach is recommended as it is associated with decreased blood loss and shorter surgical times compared with anterior or combined approaches. Techniques with reported success include pedicle screw fixation combined with Smith-Petersen osteotomies that yield sustained curve correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hyperkyphosis-in-older-persons/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].
