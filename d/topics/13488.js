In the prevaccine era, the disease predominantly affected children &lt;10 years of age and usually manifested as a prolonged cough illness with one or more of the classical symptoms: inspiratory whoop, paroxysmal cough, and posttussive emesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Since the introduction of pertussis vaccines, the epidemiology of reported pertussis infections has changed; in the United States in the 1990s, more than one-half of cases occurred in adolescents and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Infected adolescents and adults serve as a reservoir for infection of infants and children in whom serious morbidity and mortality may occur. Symptoms and signs in adolescents and adults are often nonspecific, and the diagnosis may not be considered.</p><p>Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pertussis will be reviewed here. Issues related to the pathogenesis, epidemiology, treatment, and prevention of pertussis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertussis-infection-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pertussis infection: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pertussis infection in adolescents and adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertussis-infection-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pertussis infection in infants and children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertussis-infection-in-infants-and-children-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pertussis infection in infants and children: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248746150\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incubation period following exposure is typically 7 to 10 days but may be three weeks or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This incubation period is considerably longer than that of common upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold (one to three days). Infection with <em>B. pertussis</em> in individuals without preexisting immunity is characterized by three phases: the catarrhal phase, the paroxysmal phase, and the convalescent phase. In infected adolescents or adults with a history of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity, classic symptoms may or may not occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19936977\"><span class=\"h2\">Catarrhal phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The catarrhal phase is the earliest phase of illness, lasting one to two weeks, and is characterized by nonspecific symptoms including generalized malaise, rhinorrhea, and mild cough. Slight temperature elevations may be present, but high fever is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Two early clinical findings suggestive of pertussis are excessive lacrimation and conjunctival injection. Diagnostic tests are most accurate during this phase; however, the nonspecific clinical manifestations rarely lead to suspicion of pertussis. (See <a href=\"#H5005306\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248746164\"><span class=\"h2\">Paroxysmal phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The paroxysmal stage begins during the second week of illness. The hallmark symptom, paroxysmal cough, is a series of severe, vigorous coughs that occur during a single expiration. Paroxysms often occur in groups and can be quite distressing to patients (both children and adults) as well as caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Following a prolonged cough paroxysm, a vigorous inspiration causes the distinctive &quot;whooping&quot; sound. This sound is common in affected infants and small children due to the relatively small caliber of their trachea; it may also occur in adults. Posttussive syncope or emesis can also occur during the paroxysmal phase.</p><p>The cough is present throughout the day and night and may be precipitated by acts such as yawning, stretching, laughing, yelling, or exercise. Cough may be worse at night and can be triggered by the inhalation of steam, mist, or other respiratory irritants. Patients often feel otherwise well and have few symptoms between cough paroxysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Untreated, the paroxysmal phase generally lasts two to three months then gradually transitions to the convalescent phase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5001888\"><span class=\"h2\">Convalescent phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The convalescent phase is characterized by a gradual reduction in the frequency and severity of cough. It usually lasts one to two weeks but may be prolonged. The total duration of all three phases is typically about three months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248746178\"><span class=\"h2\">Adolescents and adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of pertussis in adolescents and adults are often less severe than in infants and children. Prior infection or immunization may attenuate the illness, but neither confers lifelong immunity. As a result, prolonged cough may be the only symptom in adolescents and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The presence or absence of the classically described manifestations (ie, inspiratory whoop, paroxysmal cough, posttussive emesis, or syncope) is only modestly useful in determining whether prolonged cough represents pertussis in adolescents and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One review suggested that the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting in adults strongly suggests the diagnosis of pertussis, while the absence of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever makes pertussis unlikely; however, based on the calculated likelihood ratios, these findings are only modestly useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other symptoms may also occur; these include sputum production, coryza, sweating episodes, and sore throat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F108889\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108889 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Several studies have shown that pertussis is responsible for a substantial portion of prolonged cough illnesses in adolescents and adults. Among adults with acute cough illness (&lt;28 days), the prevalence of pertussis infection is 3 percent; greater duration of cough at presentation (ie, &gt;2 weeks) increased the likelihood of pertussis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248746185\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of pertussis may be related to the infection itself (eg, pneumonia, otitis media) or the mechanical sequelae of the severe cough (eg, subconjunctival hemorrhage, development or exacerbation of abdominal wall hernia, rib fractures, urinary incontinence, or lumbar strain). Rarely, vigorous coughing may cause more serious problems, including intracranial hemorrhage, stroke due to carotid or vertebral artery dissection, and encephalopathy or seizures (presumed due to hypoxia).</p><p>In general, morbidity and mortality due to pertussis are most common in infants and young children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F108902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108902 \">table 2</a>). In adolescents and adults, the prolonged cough may result in substantial time lost from school or work as well as social isolation, sleep deprivation, or anxiety about an undiagnosed condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Asthma and tobacco use increase the severity of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The risk of hospitalization in adults increases with age and is highest in smokers and individuals over 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248746192\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of cough is broad; the duration of illness is useful in narrowing the potential causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Cough that has been present less than three weeks is considered acute; cough present for three to eight weeks is classified as subacute; and cough present for more than eight weeks is chronic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Many adolescents and adults with pertussis, particularly those with milder manifestations, first seek medical attention only after several weeks of coughing (ie, with a subacute or chronic cough illness).</p><p>The most common cause of acute cough is self-limited viral upper respiratory tract infections (eg, the common cold). Subacute cough often represents persistence of an acute respiratory infection (eg, viral or bacterial upper airway infections or lower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia). Chronic cough may be attributable to cigarette smoking, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, postnasal drip, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248746199\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosing pertussis in adolescent and adults requires a high index of suspicion. Early diagnosis is important as it can prevent the spread of infection, particularly in vulnerable populations (eg, infants and young children). In addition, antibiotic treatment given in the early stages may shorten the duration of symptoms. Given the variable and nonspecific symptoms of pertussis, microbiological testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5005306\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical case definition advocated by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) is a cough illness lasting two weeks without an apparent cause, with one of the following symptoms: paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory whoop, or posttussive emesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80177\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80177 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In the setting of a pertussis outbreak or known close contact with a confirmed case, the presence of a cough lasting &ge;2 weeks is sufficient for clinical diagnosis (even in the absence of other symptoms). In outbreaks, the sensitivity and specificity of this case definition for detecting culture-positive pertussis has been 84 and 63 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In non-outbreak settings, the choice of diagnostic tests (culture, polymerase chain reaction [PCR], serology) depends upon the duration of cough (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83305 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with less than two weeks of cough in whom there is clinical concern for pertussis, perform both culture and PCR.

The sensitivity of culture declines after the first two weeks, but PCR remains useful up to four weeks since it can detect nonviable organisms. Both tests should be performed since the accuracy of PCR as a stand-alone diagnostic test requires further study. Serology may be a useful alternative to culture in this setting once it has been standardized and more widely available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with more than four weeks of cough, only serology is useful.</p><p/><p>Patients with discordant test results (eg, positive culture with negative PCR, negative culture with positive PCR, or positive serology with negative PCR) should be presumed to have pertussis.</p><p>Confirmed and probable cases of pertussis are defined in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80177\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80177 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Bacterial culture and PCR are the most useful clinical tools, and these are the diagnostic modalities recommended by the CDC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Specimens must be collected by swab or aspiration from the ciliated respiratory epithelium of the posterior nasopharynx where <em>B. pertussis</em> resides, rather than the anterior nares or throat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81502\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81502 \">picture 1</a>). A nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate should be obtained whenever possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Cotton-tipped or rayon swabs should <strong>not</strong> be used for obtaining culture specimens as they contain fatty acids that are toxic to <em>B. pertussis</em>. Instead, a calcium alginate or polyester (such as Dacron) swab with a flexible metal shaft should be used. For PCR specimen collection, polyester or rayon swabs should be used; cotton-tipped swabs and calcium alginate may interfere with the assay.</p><p>Obtaining a specimen from the posterior nasopharynx is uncomfortable for the patient, often leading to suboptimal specimen collection. Therefore, the patient should be educated about the importance of a properly obtained specimen and forewarned about the discomfort of the procedure. Proper specimen collection typically induces coughing or sneezing; therefore, the person obtaining the specimen should wear a protective face mask and gloves.</p><p>The CDC has developed <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/clinical/diagnostic-testing/specimen-collection.html&amp;token=Z2/ViSnOQfy3dbRkhKikdxG36NqqYYgJFrEqMT5g4clhlmu4t78vXkkojrnvjGT6fLAXPbCNlQCglKU3MzxFQAv4YNhcFtjsaSWQzPi5CjU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=8045\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">short videos</a> describing the proper collection of nasopharyngeal aspirate and swab specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248746220\"><span class=\"h3\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Culture is the gold standard laboratory test for diagnosis of pertussis; it has excellent specificity (100 percent), but sensitivity in clinical practice is only 20 to 80 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78189 \">table 4</a>). Patient-specific factors that reduce the sensitivity of culture include prolonged duration of illness by the time a specimen is collected, recent antibiotic use, and prior vaccination. Technique-specific factors include incorrect specimen collection technique, prolonged transport time to the laboratory, delayed specimen plating, and fastidious nature of the organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Immediate plating of the specimen is optimal but is not typically practical in clinical situations.</p><p>After specimen collection, use of a special transport media (Regan-Lowe agar) rather than standard media (such as modified Stuart's) will help to prevent loss of <em>B. pertussis</em> and overgrowth of other nasopharyngeal organisms. Borget-Genou agar is the classic medium for isolating <em>B. pertussis</em>; Regan-Lowe agar is preferred by most laboratories because of its longer shelf life. Growth on culture media typically takes 7 to 10 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248746234\"><span class=\"h3\">PCR testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCR is used for diagnosis of pertussis in most cases reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; culture and direct fluorescent antibody testing were the main diagnostic tests employed in the early 1990s. PCR testing is more sensitive than culture as it may detect small numbers of viable and nonviable organisms; specificity is high. Primers from four chromosomal regions are employed: repeated insertion sequences (such as IS481, which is also present in lesser quantities in <em>Bordetella holmesii</em> and <em>Bordetella bronchiseptica</em>), the pertussis toxin gene (PT), the PT promoter region, and the adenylate cyclase gene (not specific to <em>B. pertussis</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26</a>].</p><p>PCR is not affected by previous antibiotic use, and results are typically available within one to two days.

Serologic testing typically involves comparing levels of pertussis antibodies (IgA or IgG to pertussis toxin [PT], filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA], pertactin [PRN], fimbriae, or sonicated whole organism) in acute and convalescent (more than four weeks after the acute sample is obtained) sera; a substantial change in the titers (typically a fourfold increase or more) suggests infection. Infection with other <em>Bordetella</em> species also induces antibodies to FHA, PRN, and the sonicated whole organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and FHA antibodies are also induced by other bacteria (eg, <em>H. influenzae</em>, <em>M. pneumoniae</em>, and <em>C. pneumoniae</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], so these are not specific for <em>B. pertussis</em>.

In the setting of delayed collection of the acute phase specimen, antibody titers may have already peaked, and a further rise in the convalescent specimen may not be observed. Alternatively, a single sample titer above a designated threshold (typically IgG anti-PT &ge;100 to 125 endotoxin units <span class=\"nowrap\">[EU]/mL)</span> or decreases in antibody titers between the acute and convalescent titers may be diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Single-specimen titers are useful in adolescent and adults but not in children since recent immunization can affect the results.

(See <a href=\"#H248746178\" class=\"local\">'Adolescents and adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical case definition of pertussis advocated by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) is a cough illness lasting two weeks without clear cause and one of the following symptoms: paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory whoop, or posttussive emesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80177\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80177 \">table 3</a>). In the setting of an outbreak or known close contact to a confirmed case of pertussis, the presence of a cough lasting &ge;2 weeks is sufficient for clinical diagnosis (even in the absence of other symptoms). (See <a href=\"#H5005306\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of diagnostic test (culture, polymerase chain reaction [PCR], serology) depends to some degree upon the duration of cough. Culture and PCR are appropriate for patients with up to four weeks of cough; the sensitivity of culture is highest during the first two weeks of illness. For patients with more than four weeks of cough, only serology is useful, but the lack of a widely available, standardized test limits its use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83305 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5005306\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirmed cases of pertussis are defined as: (1) patients with an acute cough illness of any duration and positive culture from nasopharyngeal secretions, (2) patients who meet the clinical case definition with laboratory confirmation by PCR from nasopharyngeal secretions, or (3) patients who meet the clinical case definition and are epidemiologically linked to a case confirmed by culture or PCR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80177\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80177 \">table 3</a>).
