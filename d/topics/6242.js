Nasopharyngeal carcinoma displays a distinct racial and geographic distribution, which is reflective of its multifactorial etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic and ethnic distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma demonstrates a marked geographical variation. It is rare in the United States and Western Europe, with an incidence of 0.5 to 2 cases per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. By contrast, nasopharyngeal carcinoma is endemic in Southern China, including Hong Kong, where the incidence may reach 25 cases per 100,000 per year. Intermediate-risk regions include Southeast Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, and the Arctic. Populations that migrate from areas of high to low risk retain an elevated risk, although this risk typically diminishes in successive generations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex and age distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is two- to threefold higher in males compared with females.</p><p>In high-risk populations, the incidence peaks around 50 to 59 years of age and declines thereafter. There is also a minor incidence peak observed among adolescents and young adults in Southeast Asia, the Middle <span class=\"nowrap\">East/North</span> Africa, and the United States. In most low-risk populations, nasopharyngeal carcinoma incidence increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Secular trend</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma has declined over the past 30 years in many endemic areas, including Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The reasons for this decline are unclear, although they are generally attributed to lifestyle changes associated with the rapid economic development that occurred in these areas. As an example, there has been a decreased use of salted fish in feeding infants and reduced exposure to traditional preserved food. However, the declining incidence may also be due to population shifts as a result of altered immigration patterns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The geographic variation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma incidence suggests a multifactorial etiology. In endemic populations, risk appears to be due to an interaction of several factors: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, environmental factors, such as the high intake of preserved foods and smoking, and genetic predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Furthermore, the increased incidence in younger adults in high- and intermediate-risk areas suggests that exposure to a common agent early in life is a critical factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the United States and Europe, nasopharyngeal carcinoma is more commonly associated with alcohol and tobacco usage, which are classic risk factors for other head and neck tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H308758431\"><span class=\"h2\">Epstein-Barr virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large body of evidence supports the role of EBV as a primary etiologic agent in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This includes the detection of both EBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and EBV gene expression in precursor lesions and tumor cells. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells express a specific subgroup of EBV-latent proteins, including EBNA-1 and two integral membrane proteins, LMP-1 and LMP-2, along with the BamHI-A fragment of the EBV genome. Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma also demonstrate specific serologic responses to various gene products of EBV, particularly immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies directed against the EBV viral capsid antigen <span class=\"nowrap\">(VCA/IgA)</span>.

Multiple chromosomal abnormalities (eg, copy number changes on chromosomes 3p, 9p, 11q, 12p, and 14q), gene alterations (eg, p16 deletion and lymphotoxin-beta receptor [LTBR] amplification), and epigenetic changes (eg, RASSF1A and TSLC1 methylation) have been identified by various genome-wide approaches. Studies on the precancerous lesions and in vitro immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell models provide important evidence for the involvement of genetic alterations and EBV infection in early development of this cancer, and critical genetic events contribute to the initiation and progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The clinical triad of a neck mass, nasal obstruction with epistaxis, and serous otitis media occurs infrequently, although each of these symptoms occurs commonly in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Otitis media in an adult without a prior history of this condition should raise the suspicion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, especially if the patient is of an ethnicity with a high incidence of this disease.</p><p>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma frequently originates from the pharyngeal recess, the fossa of Rosenmuller.

Although screening for early detection is offered to first-degree relatives of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma by a few oncology centers in Southern China, routine screening has not become a standard practice in other locations. Various noninvasive methods of nasopharyngeal carcinoma detection have been studied; these include EBV-specific antibody-based assays, measurement of circulating EBV DNA levels, and EBV DNA and BARF1 oncogene messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) detection from nasopharyngeal brushings.</p><p>Quantitation of circulating EBV DNA has also been studied as a method for nasopharyngeal carcinoma screening in an endemic area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>].

They were retested approximately four weeks later, and 309 (1.5 percent of the original cohort, 27.8 percent of those originally positive) remained positive for EBV DNA. These patients were then evaluated with endoscopic examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nasopharyngeal carcinoma was diagnosed in 34 cases, and 24 (71 percent) were stage I or II. For the newly diagnosed cases, the three-year progression-free survival was 97 percent. Among the 19,865 individuals initially screened negative for plasma EBV DNA, only one case of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was diagnosed in the year after screening. The sensitivity and specificity were 97.1 and 98.6 percent, respectively. The positive and negative predictive value in this high-risk population (male aged 40 to 62) were 11 and 99.995 percent, respectively.</p><p>In patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the characteristic anti-EBV serologic profile consists of a sustained rise in antibodies to VCA and early antigen IgA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In Southern China, where nasopharyngeal carcinoma is endemic, EBV serology, ie, serum <span class=\"nowrap\">VCA/IgA</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">IgA/early</span> antigen antibody titers, has been used for population-based screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. However, EBV-specific serologic screening has limited specificity for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and an elevated titer may precede a diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma for a period of up to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring for treatment response and recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring of posttreatment plasma EBV DNA levels may have a role in evaluating treatment response and detecting recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].
