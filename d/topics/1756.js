More specifically, BEN is most likely to occur among those living along the confluence of the Danube River, a region in which the plains and low hills generally have high humidity and rainfall. The most likely cause of BEN is exposure to aristolochic acid (AA). In contrast to the classic presentation of AA nephropathy, which is characterized by a rapid decline in renal function (six months to two years), BEN is slowly progressive (10 to 20 years), however, likely due to low-level exposure.</p><p>This topic reviews BEN. The classic presentation of AA nephropathy is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephropathy induced by aristolochic acid (AA) containing herbs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The estimated prevalence of BEN in endemic areas ranges between 0.5 to 4.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It has been suggested that the prevalence would be as high as 20 percent if aggressive screening were to be performed in at-risk populations; a striking observation is that nearly all affected patients were farmers. In some regions in Bosnia, approximately 10 percent of the patients on dialysis have BEN as the cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>For many decades, the prevalence of BEN remained stable and approximately the same in the majority of endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, over the past several years, diverse and conflicting data on prevalence have been reported in several countries harboring BEN.</p><p>This could suggest that disease activity differs between endemic foci, implying that an environmental agent is still present in some endemic areas while decreasing or absent in others. In the last few decades, exposure to aristolochic acid (AA), a strong environmental nephrotoxin and carcinogen, has decreased due to the significant improvement in farming and milling practices and prevention of the contamination of flour. Alternatively, the differences in prevalence observed in different countries could be due to differences in diagnostic criteria and methodology, in case fatality or duration of disease, or in immigration patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the years, an impressive number of potential etiologic agents and genetic factors have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. BEN is most likely caused by chronic exposure to low concentrations of aristolochic acid (AA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. AA, a mutagenic and nephrotoxic alkaloid found in the plant <em>Aristolochia clematis</em>, most likely underlies both Chinese herbal nephropathy and BEN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. There are striking pathologic and clinical similarities between BEN and the progressive interstitial fibrosis observed in young women who have been on a slimming regimen including Chinese herbs (as well as other agents) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F83518\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83518 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In addition, using ultrasensitive methods utilizing liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy, aristolactam-DNA adducts were demonstrated in the renal cortex of individuals with BEN and in urothelial tumors from individuals from endemic regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Characteristic A:T&rarr;T:A mutations of the <em>TP53</em> tumor-suppressor gene were also identified in urothelial tumors from residents of BEN-endemic villages. In a follow-up study, aristolactam-DNA adducts were demonstrated in 70 percent of 67 individuals with urothelial tumors who resided in BEN-endemic areas. The aristolactam-DNA adducts were present in 94 percent of individuals who had A:T&rarr;T:A mutations in <em>TP53</em>. By contrast, neither the aristolactam-DNA adducts nor A:T&rarr;T:A mutations were detected in urothelial tumors of 10 patients residing in nonendemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephropathy induced by aristolochic acid (AA) containing herbs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These clinical, histopathologic, epidemiologic, and toxicologic data suggest that long-term exposure to AA is the etiologic factor in BEN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. AA nephropathy has been proposed as a more correct term for BEN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Other toxins and environmental exposures that are found in the Balkans <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> are unique to that area have been considered. Many suspect agents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> general group of compounds or organisms have been implicated, but none have been definitively linked. These include trace elements (lead, cadmium, silica, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a>), viruses, plant toxins, fungi (ochratoxin A, a mycotoxin), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aromatic hydrocarbons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>Ochratoxin A, a mycotoxin which induces oxidative DNA damage and causes nephrotoxicity in experimental models, has been found in much higher levels in the blood and urine of individuals in areas endemic for BEN and affected with BEN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. However, similarly high exposure occurs throughout the world in farming communities, which are largely free of chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or other toxins leached from coal into the water supply were found in higher levels in affected areas in one study, but a larger study failed to find higher levels of these hydrocarbons or other dissolved organic compounds in the water supply of endemic villages compared with nonendemic villages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A genetic predisposition to BEN has been proposed by some investigators. Support for this hypothesis includes observations that the disease clearly affects specific families and that some ethnic populations who have lived in the area for generations (such as Gypsies) do not suffer from BEN. Although a mode of inheritance has not been established, polygenetic inheritance appears to be most plausible.</p><p>The reported prevalence of BEN is 3 to 7 percent in the exposed population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Genetically determined interindividual variability may contribute to the risk of developing BEN and urothelial tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Polymorphisms that effect susceptibility to BEN and urothelial tumors are likely to be found in genes responsible for the absorption, bioactivation metabolism, detoxification (cytochrome P450-mediated O-methylation), excretion, and transport of AA.</p><p>A possible causative gene(s) has not been identified. Candidate genes have been localized to the region between 3q24 and 3q26 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Given the association with bladder cancer, a correlation with mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene has also been explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Whether this gene predisposes to BEN or bladder cancer in these patients is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant treatment options for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'p53 status for risk-directed clinical trials'</a>.)</p><p>A unifying hypothesis may be that BEN develops in genetically predisposed individuals who are chronically exposed to a causative agent found within endemic areas. This possibility was suggested by a study of 100 adult offspring (mean age 49 years) of individuals with BEN who were compared with adults from unaffected families (most of whom were from endemic villages) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Individuals whose mothers had BEN had slightly smaller kidneys and somewhat greater degree of proteinuria, moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;), and beta2-microglobinuria. These individuals probably represent early cases of BEN and suggest a maternal association with BEN risk. Whether this reflects an X-linked genetic factor or exposure to environmental toxins in utero is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>However, the following observations are inconsistent with a genetic basis or in utero exposure as a sole explanation for the disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BEN has been observed in individuals who have migrated from nonendemic into endemic areas and in previously unaffected families who have lived for at least 15 years in endemic areas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BEN does <strong>not</strong> develop in individuals who left endemic areas early in life, despite being from previously affected families, or who spent less than 15 years in high-incidence areas.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With early disease, renal histology reveals cortical focal tubular atrophy, interstitial edema, and peritubular and glomerular sclerosis, with limited mononuclear cell infiltration. Narrowing and endothelial swelling of interstitial capillaries (eg, capillarosclerosis) are also described.</p><p>In advanced cases, marked tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis develop, along with focal segmental glomerular changes and global sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As mentioned, there is also an extremely high incidence of cellular atypia and urothelial carcinoma of the genitourinary tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BEN is a slowly progressive tubulointerstitial disease that may culminate in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Clinical manifestations first appear in patients 30 to 50 years of age; findings prior to the age of 20 years are extremely rare.</p><p>One of the first signs of BEN, detected only when prospective monitoring is performed, is tubular dysfunction. This is characterized by increased excretion of low-molecular-weight proteins (such as beta2-microglobulin and neopterin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]) that are not detected on the urine dipstick for protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/26,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30</a>]. As an example, among offspring of patients with BEN who had no clinical renal abnormalities, 6 percent had elevated beta2-microglobulin levels compared with 1 percent in the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Early tubular injury can also lead to renal glucosuria, aminoaciduria, and diminished ability to handle an acid load. Over more than 20 years, there is a progressive decrease in concentrating ability (possibly resulting in polyuria) and in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Many patients eventually progress to ESRD. As an example, among 18 patients with BEN followed for a mean of 15 years, six progressed to requiring dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Additional clinical features include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are usually normotensive and without edema; hypertension only develops with end-stage disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A normochromic normocytic anemia occurs with early disease, which becomes increasingly pronounced as the disorder progresses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is rarely observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The kidneys are usually of normal size early in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Intrarenal calcifications are not observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High incidence of transitional cell carcinoma, predominantly of the renal pelvis and ureter, but also involving the urinary bladder, in BEN-endemic areas (2 to 50 percent, which is a 2- to 10-fold higher incidence than in nonendemic areas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/balkan-endemic-nephropathy/abstract/2,34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,34-37</a>].
