It happens when normal cells in the larynx change into abnormal cells and grow out of control (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83209\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83209 \">figure 1</a>). The larynx, also called the voice box, is the top part of the windpipe. The larynx has the vocal cords in it, which are small structures that let people speak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207201\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of laryngeal cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of laryngeal cancer can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hoarse voice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cough or coughing up blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing or noisy breathing</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not laryngeal cancer. But if you have these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207216\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for laryngeal cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. During the exam, he or she might use a special mirror to look in your mouth and down your throat.</p><p>Your doctor will also look down your throat using a &quot;scope,&quot; which is a thin tube with a camera and light on the end. During this procedure, he or she might do a test called a biopsy. For a biopsy, the doctor takes a small sample of tissue from the area that looks like cancer. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope.</p><p>Some people also have an imaging test, such as an MRI, CT, or PET scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207231\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out if a cancer has spread past the layer of tissue where it began, and, if so, how far.</p><p>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the stage of your laryngeal cancer and your other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207246\"><span class=\"h1\">How is laryngeal cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for laryngeal cancer involves one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the cancer &ndash; The type of surgery depends on how big the cancer is and where in the larynx it is. Sometimes, doctors can do &quot;minimally invasive surgery,&quot; which involves less cutting. Other times, doctors need to remove part or all of the larynx.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p>After treatment with surgery or radiation, people can have problems eating, swallowing, or talking. If this happens to you, you will have treatment called rehabilitation, or &quot;rehab&quot; for short. During rehab, doctors, nurses, and other health professionals will work with you on eating, swallowing, or talking.</p><p>Many people worry about being able to talk after part or all of their larynx is removed. But after surgery, you will learn new ways to make sounds and talk. If needed, there are also devices that can help you speak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207261\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor will check you every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Follow-up tests can include exams, blood tests, and imaging tests. People who are treated for laryngeal cancer also need to see their dentist for regular follow-ups.</p><p>You should also watch for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean your laryngeal cancer has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207276\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my laryngeal cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your laryngeal cancer comes back or spreads, you might have more surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207291\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for laryngeal cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13207306\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=throat-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Throat cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dysphagia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dysphagia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=minimally-invasive-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Minimally invasive surgery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
