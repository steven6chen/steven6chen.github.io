These include palpitations, tachycardia, tremulousness, anxiety, and heat intolerance. Thus, a beta blocker should be started (assuming there are no contraindications to its use) in most patients as soon as the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made, even before determining the cause of the hyperthyroidism. They should be continued until resolution of hyperthyroidism.</p><p>The clinical use and efficacy of beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of hyperthyroidism are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults: Overview of treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-storm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid storm&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7468837\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many tissues, hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased number of beta-adrenergic receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The ensuing increase in beta-adrenergic activity is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with this disorder. It also explains the ability of beta blockers to ameliorate rapidly many of the symptoms, including palpitations, tachycardia, tremulousness, anxiety, and heat intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a small, randomized trial, patients receiving beta blockers with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a>, compared with patients receiving methimazole alone, had a lower heart rate and improvement in fatigability, shortness of breath, and physical functioning after four weeks of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propranolol</a> in high doses (above 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> also slowly decreases serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations by as much as 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], via inhibition of the 5'-monodeiodinase that converts thyroxine (T4) to T3. Propranolol is highly lipid soluble, allowing it to become sufficiently concentrated in tissues to inhibit monodeiodinase activity. This effect of propranolol is slow, occurring over 7 to 10 days, and contributes little to the therapeutic effects of the drug. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atenolol</a>, alprenolol, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> similarly cause minimal reductions in serum T3 concentrations, whereas <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a> do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Despite this theoretical advantage of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> and related drugs, the small effect and slow onset severely limit their usefulness for reducing serum T3 concentrations. If deiodinase inhibition is considered important in a patient with severe hyperthyroidism (eg, thyroid storm or impending thyroid storm), it is best achieved by the addition of an iodinated radiocontrast agent to the medical regimen (these agents are currently not available in the United States), or the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a> (PTU). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodinated-radiocontrast-agents-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodinated radiocontrast agents in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-storm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid storm&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta blockers should be given to most hyperthyroid patients who do not have a contraindication to their use. Beta blockers are relatively or, depending upon disease severity, absolutely contraindicated in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud phenomenon, bradycardia, second- or third-degree heart block, and hypoglycemia-prone diabetics in whom the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-patient-with-copd-and-cardiovascular-disease#H81297784\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the patient with COPD and cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Treatment of CVD in patients with COPD'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of beta blockers&quot;, section on 'Adverse noncardiac effects due to beta blockade'</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of contraindications, beta blockers can be administered as soon as the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made, even before obtaining a definitive diagnosis as to the etiology of the thyrotoxicosis. In patients with Graves' disease, beta blockers are typically coadministered with a thionamide when a thionamide is chosen for initial treatment, and they are typically given to patients who are treated initially with radioiodine who do not require pretreatment with a thionamide.</p><p>Patients with relative contraindications to beta blockade may better tolerate beta-1-selective drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>. We generally use atenolol in an initial dose of 25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day;</span> up to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (higher doses should be divided into twice-daily administration) can be given if needed for the symptomatic treatment of hyperthyroidism and control of tachycardia. Atenolol has the advantages of single-daily dosing and beta-1 selectivity; however, all beta-adrenergic blocking drugs effectively diminish hyperthyroid symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults: Overview of treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Beta blockers are also used preoperatively in patients who are having a thyroidectomy and are allergic to thionamides. The longer-acting drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>, provide for more constant intraoperative and postoperative control, and minimize the need for intravenous beta blocker administration during the period that the patient is unable to take oral medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. One report demonstrated an increased spontaneous abortion risk in pregnant women with hyperthyroidism treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> and a thionamide versus a thionamide alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This observation raises questions about the use of beta blockers to treat hyperthyroidism during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].
