There are several reasons for this:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants born at the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy often are growth-restricted because they have smaller nutrient stores compared with infants born at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical conditions, including hypotension, hypoxia, acidosis, infection, and surgery, increase metabolic energy requirements and, thus, nutrient needs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional impediments to growth are physiologic immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract, including decreased gastrointestinal motility and reduced intestinal enzyme activity, and therapies such as corticosteroids.</p><p/><p>Fortification of human milk is required to meet the high nutritional needs of the preterm infant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110683 \">table 1</a>). If human milk is not available, preterm formula, which is enriched in protein, energy content, minerals, and micronutrients, should be provided to the preterm infant. This nutritional support helps to correct growth restriction at birth and to achieve an appropriate rate of weight gain, which is almost twice that of a term infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>Parenteral nutrition is necessary for infants whose immaturity or medical condition precludes enteral feeding.

The predominance of whey and the amino acid composition of human milk and premature formula are beneficial for premature infants as compared with bovine milk, and also when compared with term infant formulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Whey predominance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both human milk and premature formula contain an increased proportion of whey to casein. Human milk is 70 percent whey and 30 percent casein, and premature formula is 60 percent whey and 40 percent casein. In contrast, bovine milk contains predominantly casein (82 percent). The high proportion of whey in human milk or premature formula is beneficial for premature infants for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whey-dominant milk promotes more rapid gastric emptying than does casein-dominant milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The whey fraction in human milk consists of soluble proteins that are easily digested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The major human whey protein is alpha-lactalbumin, a nutritional protein. The major bovine whey protein is beta-lactoglobulin, which may contribute to protein allergy and colic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Human milk fortifiers in the United States now contain protein hydrolysate preparations instead of intact protein.

In one study, human milk providing 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> protein per day was compared with whey or casein-dominant formulas providing 2.25 or 4.50 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> protein per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Infants fed human milk had the lowest concentrations of methionine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]; high levels of these amino acids are thought to interfere with brain development. In addition, human milk and premature formula contain cysteine and taurine, two amino acids that are &quot;conditionally essential&quot; in premature infants (ie, required because of prematurity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Infants with a higher protein intake demonstrated better weight gain and had a greater nitrogen accretion rate, suggesting that some or all of the increase in weight gain was due to a gain in lean body mass. There was no difference in the plasma phenylalanine level between the two groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two additional studies published after the meta-analysis provided support for protein intakes greater than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day:</span> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the first study, 18 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight &lt;1500 g) had increased protein accretion and better weight gain during the week when they received a formula providing protein at 3.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/100</span> kcal compared with a formula with protein at 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/100</span> kcal for one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

This is because human milk does not meet the protein requirements for premature infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110683 \">table 1</a>). Although the protein content of milk from mothers who deliver premature infants (preterm milk) may be as high as 3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> initially, protein content declines over four weeks of lactation to a level of 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. Fortification of milk with a human milk fortifier to achieve a protein intake of 3 to 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day improves rates of weight gain and indices of protein nutritional status such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum albumin, and transthyretin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/25-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-31</a>]. Most commercially available human milk fortifiers in the United States also provide adequate quantities of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, zinc, copper, and multivitamins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human milk feeding and fortification of human milk for premature infants&quot;, section on 'Fortification of human milk'</a> and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Calcium and phosphorus'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Vitamins'</a> below.) </p><p>Human milk fortifiers used to supplement breast milk contain lyophilized protein that can be human or bovine. Both sources have similar effects on nitrogen utilization and growth. However, the protein source may affect plasma amino acid patterns. As an example, plasma concentrations of cystine, taurine, and proline are greater when lyophilized human milk protein is added [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/5,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,32</a>].

Lipids in human milk may be particularly suitable for the premature infant because of the complex organization of the fat globule, the pattern of fatty acids, and the presence of bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. These factors promote the digestion and absorption of lipid. As an example, in a small study, fecal lipid excretion was lower in premature infants fed a mixture of fresh human milk and formula compared with those fed 100 percent formula (5 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703992403\"><span class=\"h2\">Total fat content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lipid content of human milk varies from 2.2 to 4.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and contributes to variations in energy content (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110683 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

If a premature infant is gaining less than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> body weight per day and the mother is able to produce more milk than her infant needs, we recommend use of fortified hindmilk. This is accomplished by discarding the first five minutes of milk expression (foremilk) and collecting the remainder (hindmilk) to be used for feeds.</p><p>In one study, the additional lipid and energy intake from hindmilk improved weight gain in premature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, caution is advised because the lower protein content of hindmilk compared with foremilk (9 versus 12 percent of calories) is less than the 10 to 12 percent of protein calories recommended for premature infants. Addition of commercial human milk fortifiers to hindmilk increases the proportion of protein calories to approximately 12 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703992469\"><span class=\"h3\">Delivery of lipid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipid separates in standing human milk because human milk is not homogenized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Separated lipid may adhere to collection containers, feeding tubes, and syringes, thereby decreasing the delivery of lipid to the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Lipid delivery is more efficient with bolus compared with continuous tubing feeding. Improved delivery of both can be achieved by using short tubing and a vertical syringe.

This is because lipids in bovine milk are less well-absorbed than human milk, and the higher MCFA content in formula is intended to achieve lipid absorption similar to that of human milk</p><p>The higher MCFA content of preterm formulas as compared with human milk is controversial. Although initial studies demonstrated that MCFA were more easily absorbed than long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), subsequent studies have failed to identify a benefit of MCFA compared with LCPUFA.

DHA is of the omega-3 (or n-3) type of LCPUFA, which have antiinflammatory properties, and are preferentially incorporated into the developing brain and retina. These observations have led to proposals that supplementation with LCPUFAs might have beneficial effects on visual acuity, neurodevelopment, or growth of premature infants. However, benefits of LCPUFA supplementation generally have not been confirmed by clinical studies, as discussed in a separate topic review.

The content of calcium and phosphorus in human milk is insufficient for premature infants to achieve normal bone mineralization or mineral accretion rates similar to those achieved in utero (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65718 \">table 3</a>). Therefore, human milk should be supplemented with calcium and phosphorus to improve bone mineralization as well as linear growth. For premature infants, we recommend the addition of calcium (2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> per day, or 80 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) and phosphorus (1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> per day, or 45 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) to human milk after enteral feeding is established.

Infants who are discharged feeding on breast milk exclusively should be monitored for growth and possible mineral deficiency. For such infants, we suggest measuring serum phosphorus concentration and alkaline phosphatase activity four to eight weeks after discharge. If these values are abnormal, a radiograph of the long bones is obtained to assess mineralization. Mineral supplementation is provided if osteopenia is present. In general, laboratory monitoring is not needed in formula-fed infants after hospital discharge unless the alkaline phosphatase activity is markedly elevated at the time of discharge, which is uncommon.

Bioavailability of iron in human milk is approximately 50 percent, which is considerably higher than bioavailability in formula (3 to 4 percent).

For infants receiving human milk, an iron supplement is started after two weeks of age. Infants who are fed formula should be given iron-fortified formula from the onset. Iron intake at a dose of at least 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, via supplements or fortified formula, should be continued through the first year of life. Further supplementation with iron may be needed and is discussed elsewhere in the program.

Data were insufficient to determine whether iron supplementation had long-term benefits in regards to neurodevelopmental outcome and growth. In addition, the optimum dose of iron supplementation remained unclear as there were no differences in hematologic and neurodevelopmental outcomes between groups of infants who received high and low daily doses of iron (3 versus 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequently published trial of 285 low birth weight infants (birth weights between 2000 and 2500 g), there were no differences in the scores of cognitive testing at 3.5 years of age among patients treated with 0, 1, or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of iron from six weeks to six months of age, or between these low birth weight groups and normal birth weight controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. However, the risk of behavioral problems detected by the Child Behavior Checklist was greater in the low birth weight group treated with placebo (ie, no iron supplementation) compared with the other low birth weight groups who received iron supplementation, and compared with normal birth weight controls. In this cohort of patients, most of the patients were breastfed (91 percent) and half were exclusively breastfed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second study that was not included in the systematic review, infants with birth weights below 1800 g fed a premature formula with high iron (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> content during hospitalization had higher plasma ferritin values and less anemia compared with those fed formula with low iron content (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> both at discharge and eight weeks later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. However, as noted above, the benefit of iron intakes &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day is not proven. Iron-containing formulas contain 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> of iron. </p><p/><p>In other countries, higher doses of iron supplements are routinely administered. As an example, in Norway, iron is given as a dose of 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> which is not adjusted for weight. Thus, in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, this regimen can deliver up to 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of iron. In one study, one week of high-dose iron supplementation (18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> increased serum iron and transferrin saturation and was not associated with an increase in oxidative stress markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. It remains unclear whether these high doses of iron are beneficial because studies comparing clinical outcomes for different iron doses in preterm infants have not been performed. As a result, there are no data to support iron supplementation in preterm infants that exceed the doses recommended by the AAP.</p><p>The timing of supplementation also remains uncertain. In one study that compared timing of iron supplementation defined as early (less than 28 days postnatal age) and late (after 28 days postnatal age), there was no difference in cognitive outcome but there was an increased risk of an abnormal neurologic examination at five years of age in the group assigned to late administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">ZINC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In premature infants, absorption of zinc (Zn) is greater in human milk (both unsupplemented and supplemented) compared with either term or premature formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

Vitamin requirements for preterm infants are not known precisely. However, some data exist to provide basic recommendations. Human milk may not provide sufficient amounts. As an example, plasma concentrations of vitamin C fell rapidly in one study of premature infants fed human milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Exposure of human milk to light and its passage through feeding tubes reduce concentrations of vitamins such as vitamin A and riboflavin. A similar study has not been performed on premature formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>Human milk fortifiers and premature formulas provide additional vitamins, although the concentrations vary and may be lower than recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/72,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,87</a>]. Premature formulas generally provide adequate vitamins. Human milk fortifiers do not supply recommended intake for vitamin D intake (400 international units daily for infants weighing &gt;1500 g), and should be used in conjunction with a vitamin supplement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

Enteral nutrition can be used to achieve these nutritional goals with either fortified human milk or commercial premature formula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110683 \">table 1</a>). Although human milk is the preferred feeding for all infants, supplementation, utilizing human milk fortifiers, is required to meet the nutritional needs of premature newborns. Premature formula is an appropriate option, especially if there is an inadequate supply of mother's milk or if the mother is unable to breastfeed. Premature formula replicates many of the components of human milk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human milk feeding and fortification of human milk for premature infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Key components of human milk or preterm formula include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protein</strong> &ndash; Both human milk and premature formula have a predominance of whey protein. In premature infants, whey protein, when compared with casein protein, promotes more rapid gastric emptying, is more easily digested, and contains proteins that may play a role in host defense. However, neither human milk nor premature formula adequately meet the protein requirements of premature infants and need to be supplemented. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Protein'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lipid</strong> &ndash; Lipid comprises nearly 50 percent of the caloric content of milk and is the major energy source. Medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) is increased to 40 percent of lipid content in premature formulas compared with 12 percent in human milk. No proven benefit has been shown with this higher percentage of MCFA in premature formula.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Beneficial effects of supplemental long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) for term infants, including docosahexaenoic acids (DHA), have not been established. There are suggestions that preterm infants derive benefit from this supplementation (in fortifiers and formulas). Nonetheless, LCPUFA supplementation is included in most commercial formulas designed for preterm and term infants, and lactating women are encouraged to consume a diet that is rich in LCPUFA. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Lipid'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carbohydrate</strong> &ndash; Lactose and oligosaccharides comprise the majority of the carbohydrate content of human milk and contribute approximately 40 percent of the caloric content. In contrast with human milk, premature formulas usually contain equal proportions of lactose and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucose-polymers-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucose polymers</a>. This combination results in lower osmolality than does lactose alone. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Carbohydrate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrolytes, minerals, and trace elements</strong> (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Calcium and phosphorus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Iron'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Zinc'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Human milk does <strong>not</strong> adequately meet the premature infant's requirements for calcium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamins and, thus, requires supplementation with a human milk fortifier (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110683 \">table 1</a>). Zinc and sodium concentrations in human milk decline as lactation continues, and supplementation may be required.
