This genetic abnormality results in the formation of a unique gene product (BCR-ABL1), which is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. This deregulated tyrosine kinase is implicated in the development of CML and has become a primary target for the treatment of this disorder.</p><p>An overview of the treatment of CML will be presented here.

The most frequently used criteria, the World Health Organization (WHO) definition, defines accelerated phase as patients with CML who show one or more of the following features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10 to 19 percent blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral blood basophils &ge;20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelets <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL,</span> unrelated to therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelets <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1,000,000/microL,</span> unresponsive to therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive splenomegaly and increasing white cell count, unresponsive to therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytogenetic evolution (defined as the development of chromosomal abnormalities in addition to the Philadelphia chromosome)</p><p/><p>In virtually all patients treated with palliative chemotherapeutic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a>) and in some patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the disease culminates in an acute leukemia, termed &quot;blast crisis.&quot; Prior to the availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, this phase, which is generally refractory to treatment, occurred approximately three to five years after the diagnosis of CML and 18 months after the onset of the accelerated phase. In some patients, the progression to blast crisis can occur without an obvious preceding accelerated phase. More information on defining disease phase can be found elsewhere.

HCT is a key component of the treatment of accelerated phase and blast crisis; HCT is occasionally suggested for younger patients in chronic phase who have a suitable donor, although treatment with TKIs is preferred as initial therapy in this setting. Outcomes with allogeneic HCT in CML are directly related to the phase of disease at the time of the transplant.

With the elucidation of the molecular defect in CML came a more complete understanding of the molecular biological derangements associated with the disease, culminating in the development of oral drugs, which are highly effective in its treatment.</p><p>TKIs are the initial treatment of choice for the majority of patients with CML. Adherence to daily administration of TKIs is critical to successful treatment of CML. The first trials of TKIs in <em>BCR-ABL1</em>-positive disease evaluated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> in patients refractory to or intolerant of interferon therapy, which had been the standard of care prior to the availability of imatinib. Subsequently, the randomized IRIS trial compared imatinib with interferon therapy in previously untreated patients in chronic phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Imatinib produced significantly higher hematologic and cytogenetic response rates with deeper, more durable responses, and much less toxicity. No survival benefit has been demonstrated due to the large number of patients allowed to switch from interferon to imatinib. However, several <span class=\"nowrap\">historical/retrospective</span> comparisons have shown significantly better overall survival following treatment with imatinib than with interferon-containing regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].

These results suggest that evaluation of the peripheral blood Q-PCR may be used to monitor response and relapse. Bone marrow cytogenetics should be done to confirm initial complete response to therapy and should be repeated when there are significant rises in the peripheral blood quantitative PCR.

Several different internal reference standards are employed worldwide. Most published definitions of molecular responses use <em>ABL1</em> as the reference gene, as this is employed by the majority of laboratories, including most in the United States. GUSB is used in some European laboratories, while <em>BCR</em> is used in Australia and Asia. Many clinical laboratories now use an international reference standard to report RT-PCR results on the International Scale (IS), which allows direct comparison of patient results among laboratories and to data from clinical trials. It is preferable to obtain serial samples from individual patients at the same laboratory, if possible. </p><p>Serial monitoring of peripheral blood (rather than bone marrow) should be used for monitoring disease status. There is good concordance and correlation (r = 0.85 to 9.0) between quantitative RT-PCR results obtained from bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood, and the majority of molecular response data from clinical trials are based on analysis of peripheral blood samples. Whereas quantitative <em>BCR-ABL1</em> transcript levels on the IS vary widely at diagnosis, two studies have suggested that the velocity of decline in transcripts or the &quot;halving time&quot; may be a better measure of favorable early molecular response than an arbitrary value such as 10 percent at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Because the <em>ABL1</em> standard produces unreliable results in samples with high BCR-ABL1 transcript levels (eg, taken at or near diagnosis), an alternative reference standard such as GUSB or BCR is necessary for this analysis. </p><p>Thus, the transcript level at diagnosis using the proper control gene is generally not available, and calculations of the rate of transcript decline cannot be used clinically at this time; international efforts are underway to address this issue. In addition, even when the IS calculated with conventional assays with <em>ABL1</em> as the control gene, there is imprecision in assessments of single samples and decisions to modify therapy should not be made on the basis of a single value. As an example, one cannot reliably distinguish between an IS of 9 and 11 percent and hence, the dichotomous distinction of &gt;10 or &lt;10 percent is not necessarily clinically informative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Response criteria</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19442899\"><span class=\"h3\">Responses defined</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following categories define hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular treatment response in CML (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52082\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52082 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hematologic response</strong> &ndash; Hematologic response is assessed by the white blood cell count, differential, and platelet count.

As Q-PCR assays have become increasingly sensitive, it became clear that the term &quot;complete&quot; molecular response is misleading and likely inaccurate since residual leukemia stem cells may still be found in patients who achieve these levels of disease control. As such, it has been proposed that the term &quot;complete&quot; be abandoned and that molecular response (MR) be defined according to the upper boundary of detection of the assay used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>At this time, it is unknown whether patients with lower or undetectable transcript levels have a better long term outcome since the relapse rate is very low in patients with sustained MR<sup>3 </sup>or indeed those with complete cytogenetic response without MR<sup>3</sup>.

There are ample data (summarized below) demonstrating that patients who have large reductions in <em>BCR-ABL1</em> transcripts by three or six months have excellent long-term outcomes with few relapses. However, it is important to emphasize that patients who have very good transcript reductions, but not to the very low levels defined in the trials listed below, still have very good overall outcomes. Indeed, most studies do not show a statistically significant difference in outcomes between these two groups, and there is no evidence that an early switch to an alternative TKI is of benefit to such patients. As a consequence, the ELN guidelines do not recommend changes in therapy for such patients, but rather advise continued monitoring with the expectation that continued improvement over time will occur in most such individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90429\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90429 \">table 7</a>).</p><p>Support for the use of these response criteria comes from retrospective and prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/25,36-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,36-42</a>].

In addition, patients can progress from one to the other as their disease responds or does not respond to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Disease phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options for patients with CML are varied and include: potential cure with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); disease control without cure using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); or palliative therapy with cytotoxic agents. Factors influencing the choice of therapy include: the phase of CML; availability of a donor for HCT; patient age; the presence of medical co-morbidities affecting patient suitability for HCT or particular TKIs; and, for patients in earlier phases of CML, the response to treatment with TKIs. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Overview of treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TKIs are the initial treatment of choice for most patients with chronic phase CML. A choice among available agents should take into consideration the drug side effect profiles and the patient's comorbidities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89930 \">table 8</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chronic phase'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response to therapy is monitored periodically with blood counts, bone marrow biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the peripheral blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90430\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90430 \">table 3</a>). The hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response is then determined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52082\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52082 \">table 4</a>). The European LeukemiaNet has developed definitions of treatment failure, optimal response, and warning signs following the use of a TKI as first-line therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90418 \">table 5</a>) and the use of second-line therapy in cases of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90421\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90421 \">table 6</a>). These consensus definitions of response help guide therapy and also allow for better comparison of trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90429\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90429 \">table 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small proportion of previously untreated patients with chronic phase CML are resistant to or intolerant of treatment with a TKI. In addition, many patients with initial responses to a TKI ultimately lose their response. Treatment options for such patients include alternative TKIs and HCT. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of disease resistance or drug intolerance'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase after failure of initial therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CML in accelerated phase or blast crisis is much more difficult to control. Although many patients will have an initial response to TKI therapy, such responses are often short-lived. As such, a reasonable plan is an attempt to return the patient to a second chronic phase using a TKI with suitable candidates subsequently undergoing allogeneic HCT.
