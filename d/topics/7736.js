The average life expectancy at birth has increased from 47 years in 1900 to nearly 79 years in 2014. By 2030, the percentage of the population over 65 years of age will exceed 20 percent, or over 70 million people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-health-maintenance/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Worldwide, the number of adults over 60 years of age will top 2 billion by 2050 and will constitute over 20 percent of the world's population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-health-maintenance/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Projections based on current growth patterns indicate that the vast majority of these older adults will reside in less-developed countries (1.6 billion).</p><p>Definitions of health and wellbeing in late life have changed with the increase in life expectancy. Heart disease, cancer, and stroke have become the leading causes of death among older adults, while deaths due to infection have decreased. Adults surviving into late life suffer from high rates of chronic illness; 80 percent have at least one and 50 percent have at least two chronic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-health-maintenance/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is a strong association between the presence of geriatric syndromes (cognitive impairment, falls, incontinence, vision or hearing impairment, low body mass index [BMI], dizziness) and dependency in activities of daily living (relative risk 2.1 for one condition; 6.6 for three or more conditions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-health-maintenance/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Decline in function and loss of independence are <strong>not</strong> an inevitable consequence of aging. Given the high prevalence and impact of chronic health problems among older patients, evidence-based interventions to address these problems become increasingly important to maximize both the quantity and quality of life for older adults.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/health/projects/acove/acove3.html&amp;token=Vpu97oKx7wF8dd1x9MJ4UEJZ/cNxJT9DJH5AJMobemO3SBIuiEmnMRuAcQPKNx1IAIW1FwLuDazO6os1RXSt4Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3017\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders (ACOVE-3)</a> project identifies quality indicators in the care of older adults, including recommendations for routine health maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-health-maintenance/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

This wide heterogeneity means that treatment decisions, both preventive and therapeutic, should be considered based on individual needs. Age alone should not be the sole determinant for many interventions, and all treatments should aim to preserve function and maximize quality of life.</p><p>For decisions related to screening and other preventive interventions, the concept of lag time to benefit is relevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-health-maintenance/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If a screening intervention, such as screening for colorectal cancer with fecal occult blood testing, has a lag time of 10 years for a risk reduction of one death per 1000 persons screened, and an individual has a predicted life expectancy of five years, then such screening would not be likely to provide benefit for that individual. Studies suggest that many older patients in the United States, and women in particular, are over-screened for certain conditions and under-screened or undertreated (eg, immunizations and counseling) for others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-health-maintenance/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>A proposed framework for primary care for older individuals that defines short-term, mid-range, and long-term goals may help providers more appropriately and effectively prioritize issues in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-health-maintenance/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Short-term issues: Focus on immediate needs to maintain or restore current health status; may be the sole focus for patients at the end of life.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom management</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Care coordination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal safety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate the living situation</p><p/><p>Mid-range issues: Address needs over the subsequent one to five years.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventive care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease management</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychological issues</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coping strategies</p><p/><p>Long-term issues: For older adults who are currently healthy and high-functioning.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plans to be implemented at the time of eventual decline</p><p/><p>Approximations of life expectancy based on health and function can help providers, patients, and caregivers in prioritizing issues and making decisions.

Static balance training involves learning to recover balance on a tilting balance platform. Dynamic balance training that does not require special equipment, such as Tai Chi, may be more readily available outside of a formal supervised setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-health-maintenance/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p/><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACSM</span> guidelines emphasize a graduated or stepwise introduction of physical activity to improve safety and adherence. An individualized &quot;activity plan&quot; should recommend levels of physical activity and define how the individual will meet them. Developing an activity plan, particularly for older adults with chronic conditions, may warrant input from physical <span class=\"nowrap\">therapists/exercise</span> physiologists or referral to specialty programs (eg, cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation). Routine electrocardiogram (EKG) or cardiac exercise testing are not indicated for asymptomatic patients who are preparing to undergo an exercise program. The Medicare Initial Preventive Physical Examination (IPPE), however, does provide coverage for an initial 12-lead EKG and its interpretation as part of the introductory visit.

Age alone should not be the sole determinant for many interventions, and all treatments should aim to preserve function and maximize quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H104693352\" class=\"local\">'Goals of care for older adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A summary of recommendations for specific conditions is presented in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75220\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75220 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H94568221\" class=\"local\">'Overview of prevention for older adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthy lifestyle measures supported by evidence and current guideline recommendations include a) exercise to include aerobic activity 30 minutes daily for at least five days a week, muscle strengthening, and balance training; b) smoking cessation; and c) limiting alcohol intake. (See <a href=\"#H94568227\" class=\"local\">'Healthy lifestyle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunization schedules should include annual influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination, and herpes zoster vaccine after age 50. Older adults who have not received a Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis) should receive a one-time Tdap booster after age 65 as well. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Immunizations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer screening decisions should be based on assessment of risk and benefit as well as individual preference and life expectancy. For women who choose to undergo screening after counseling about harms and benefits, biennial screening mammography may be offered for those with at least 10 years of life expectancy. Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) is indicated beginning at age 50, using one of the several tests effective for CRC screening, with timing of discontinuation of screening based on health status. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Cancer screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given their prevalence and the effectiveness of treatments into late life, screening for hypertension (annually) and osteoporosis (women age 65 and men with risk factors, follow-up dependent on initial results) are recommended. Screening for hyperlipidemia is most strongly recommended for those with known cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H94569241\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Osteoporosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor for symptoms and conditions that often impact health, safety, and quality in late life, including cognitive impairment, depression, gait instability and falls, vision and hearing loss, poor nutrition, weight loss, and functional decline. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Hearing loss'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Vision screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H94569381\" class=\"local\">'Functional and psychosocial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regularly perform medication reconciliation to include assessment of indications, adverse effects, interactions, and cost of prescription and nonprescription medications and supplements. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Medication use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inquire about elder abuse, driving safety, and financial security.
