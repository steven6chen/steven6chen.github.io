Concomitant risks are infection, bleeding, anemia, and an increased risk of progression to acute leukemia, which is often refractory to standard treatments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no agreed upon standard treatment approach for patients with symptomatic MDS, and patients should be encouraged to enroll in clinical trials whenever available. Our treatment approach is similar to that proposed by the MDS Panel for Practice Guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and recommendations from the European LeukemiaNet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This approach incorporates knowledge of the patient's performance status, the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50634 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-myelodysplastic-syndrome-international-prognostic-scoring-system-original-ipss-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) and revised IPSS (IPSS-R) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85832 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-revised-international-prognostic-scoring-system-ipss-r-in-myelodysplastic-syndrome\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) MDS risk categories, and other disease characteristics (ie, cytopenias present, serum erythropoietin level) to help guide management decisions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H515265\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Selection of initial treatment for patients with symptomatic MDS'</a>.)</p><p>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a treatment option for patients with intermediate-2-, high-, or very high-risk MDS. A choice among treatment options in these populations is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-high-or-very-high-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H48546540\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of high or very high risk myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of MDS with HCT will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of this disorder with other therapies and the role of HCT in children with MDS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-diamond-blackfan-anemia-and-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for Diamond-Blackfan anemia and the myelodysplastic syndromes in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)&quot; will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of progenitor cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLOGENEIC HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allogeneic HCT is the only treatment for MDS with the potential for cure. However, the use of allogeneic HCT in MDS is limited by the advanced age of most patients with this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the past, patients over the age of 50 years were thought to be too old to undergo this aggressive treatment due to transplant-related complications. With improvements in technique and supportive care, a number of groups have extended the upper age limit for myeloablative allogeneic HCT to 60 years or more using chemotherapy-based preparative regimens. However, since approximately 75 percent of patients with MDS are more than 60 years of age at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], myeloablative allogeneic and syngeneic HCT can only be offered to a subset of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The advent of reduced intensity HCT, which relies more heavily on the graft-versus-tumor effect, and the availability of multiple donor options (eg, matched related, matched unrelated, umbilical cord blood, and haploidentical donors) has extended the applicability of HCT to older patients, including medically fit patients in their 70s. Such intensive therapies are preferred for patients with intermediate-2- or high-risk IPSS scores because of a low expected median survival and high rate of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia when these patients are treated with supportive care alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, under some circumstances patients with intermediate-1-risk disease can also be considered for allogeneic HCT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-high-or-very-high-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H48546540\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of high or very high risk myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intermediate-low-or-very-low-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intermediate, low, or very low risk myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9991438\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining transplant eligibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with a disease-related indication for allogeneic HCT should be offered the opportunity to discuss this procedure with a transplantation physician. For patients with MDS, this includes those with intermediate-2- or high-risk MDS as calculated by the IPSS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50634 \">table 1</a>) or with intermediate-, high-, or very high-risk MDS as calculated by the IPSS-R (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85832 \">table 2</a>). The final decision on transplant eligibility should be made based on a risk-benefit assessment, and the needs and wishes of the patient. The risk-benefit assessment usually incorporates the calculation of a risk assessment scoring system (eg, HCT-CI score, PAM score, EGBMT score). This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9992551\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient-related factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with MDS are generally elderly and only a selected subset is considered for aggressive treatments such as HCT. The determination of transplant eligibility should be made based on a risk-benefit assessment, and the needs and wishes of the patient. Eligibility for HCT varies across countries and institutions and depends on the type of transplantation (ie, allogeneic versus autologous) and the conditioning regimen (eg, myeloablative versus nonmyeloablative).</p><p>In most centers in the United States, patients are considered eligible for nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT if they are less than 75 years of age, have normal cardiac, liver, and renal function, and have a good performance status (ECOG performance status 0 or 1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 3</a>). For myeloablative allogeneic transplantation, eligibility is more restrictive in that patients should typically be less than 55 to 60 years of age depending on a number of factors, including performance status and other medical conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with MDS undergoing HCT in one study, clinical features associated with shorter relapse-free survival included older age (ie, &ge;41.5 years), <span class=\"nowrap\">refractory/relapsed</span> disease, ECOG performance status &ge;3, and &ge;3.5 years from diagnosis to HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Multivariate analysis estimated that clinical characteristics accounted for 70 percent of the total hazards for overall survival, while genetic factors accounted for 30 percent of the risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9991444\"><span class=\"h3\">Cytogenetic and molecular factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities provide important prognostic information regarding outcomes following HCT for MDS. Karyotype analysis with metaphase cytogenetics is a key component of all major prognostic scoring systems for MDS, and cytogenetic abnormalities have also demonstrated prognostic value in patients undergoing HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. We generally rely upon the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) MDS risk category (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85832 \">table 2</a>) to help guide management decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]; other prognostic scoring systems for MDS are presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The ability of the IPSS and IPSS-R cytogenetic categories to predict outcome following allogeneic HCT was evaluated in a single center, retrospective study of 1007 patients with MDS or acute leukemia evolving from MDS who underwent related (547 patients) or unrelated (460 patients) allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The estimated rates of relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), overall survival (OS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) at five years were 25, 40, 38, and 35 percent, respectively. Acute grade II to IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 69 percent (26 percent grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span>. Chronic GVHD occurred in 40 percent. While both cytogenetic risk stratification schemes provided prognostic information regarding relapse rate and survival after HCT, the five prognostic categories included in the IPSS-R were better able to differentiate among the lowest and highest risk disease. The estimated cumulative incidence of relapse at five years ranged from &lt;20 percent for patients with very good cytogenetics to approximately 50 percent for patients with very poor cytogenetics.</p><p>All patients with intermediate-2- or high-risk MDS, as calculated by the IPSS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50634 \">table 1</a>), or with intermediate-, high-, or very high-risk MDS, as calculated by the IPSS-R (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85832 \">table 2</a>), should be offered the opportunity to discuss allogeneic HCT with a transplantation physician. The final decision on transplant eligibility should be made based on a risk-benefit assessment, and the needs and wishes of the patient.</p><p>Specific molecular abnormalities also have prognostic value in MDS, and for predicting outcomes following HCT. Retrospective targeted mutational analysis was performed prior to HCT on samples from 1514 patients with MDS (adults and children) who were enrolled in the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research Repository between 2005 and 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Mutations were analyzed for association with transplantation outcomes, including OS, relapse, and death without relapse. Compared with patients who lacked these mutations, the following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>TP53</em> mutations (present in 19 percent of the patients) were associated with shorter OS (hazard ratio [HR] for death, 1.96; 95% CI 1.69-2.28) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in the TP53 regulator <em>PPM1D</em> were also associated with shorter survival (HR, 1.64; 95% CI 1.27-2.12).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients &ge;40 years who did not have <em>TP53</em> mutations, the presence of mutations in the RAS pathway (<em>NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, CBL, NF1, RIT1, FLT3, </em>and<em> KIT</em>) or <em>JAK2</em> were associated with shorter survival. Those with RAS pathway mutations had a high risk of relapse, especially following reduced intensity conditioning. In contrast, those with <em>JAK2</em> mutations had a high rate of death without relapse. (See <a href=\"#H9989758\" class=\"local\">'Nonmyeloablative or reduced-intensity regimens'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>A multi-institutional study from the Japan Marrow Donor Program reported that both clinical and molecular features were associated with post-transplant outcomes among nearly 800 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT for MDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Mutations in 69 genes (analyzed by targeted-capture sequencing) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> copy number alterations were found in more than three-quarters of these patients. Multivariate analysis estimated that genetic factors accounted for 30 percent of the total hazards for OS, while clinical characteristics accounted for 70 percent of the risk.

Observational studies and clinical decision analyses suggest that patients with intermediate, high, or very high risk IPSS-R scores (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85832 \">table 2</a>) (and those with intermediate-2 or high risk IPSS scores) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50634 \">table 1</a>) are most likely to benefit from allogeneic HCT; patients with lower scores are better served by delaying transplantation until progression to higher risk disease, but before transformation to acute myeloid leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. A potential exception is when the risk score is elevated due to cytopenias in the presence of massive splenomegaly. In such cases, splenectomy may improve the cytopenias and delay HCT. The decision for an individual patient must balance the risk of treatment-related mortality (TRM) following transplant with the risk of death due to disease progression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of TRM following transplantation varies according to both transplant-related factors (eg, preparative regimen, donor source, HLA-disparity) and patient-related factors (eg, age, comorbidities). TRM is expected to be highest for older patients with comorbidities who undergo a myeloablative transplant from a partially matched unrelated donor. The following illustrate the risk of TRM:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 387 patients with MDS who underwent myeloablative HLA-matched sibling HCT, the cumulative incidences of TRM at one and three years were 32 and 37 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. TRM increased with age. When compared with younger patients, TRM was increased in patients 18 to 30 years (relative risk [RR] 2.9), 31 to 45 years (RR 4.1), and older than 45 years (RR 4.4).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective analysis of patients with MDS undergoing HCT, TRM was 30, 43, and 50 percent for patients &lt;20 years, 20 to 40 years, and &gt;40 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>The risk of death due to disease progression is strongly dependent on the IPSS and IPSS-R scores (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50634 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85832 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes in adults&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Without treatment, the estimated median survival for those with low- or intermediate-1-risk IPSS scores ranges from three to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similarly, estimated median survival for patients with very low- or low-risk IPSS-R scores ranges from five to nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, the estimated median survival from those with intermediate-2- or high-risk IPSS scores ranges from six months to one year. The estimated median survivals for those with intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk IPSS-R scores are 3, 1.6, and 0.8 years, respectively.</p><p/><p>We and others believe that the rapid progression of those with higher risk IPSS and IPSS-R scores justifies the potential morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/1,2,15,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15,19,20</a>]. The final decision of whether to pursue allogeneic HCT should be made based on a risk-benefit assessment and the needs and wishes of the patient.</p><p>A decision regarding whether to administer AML-type induction chemotherapy prior to proceeding with an allogeneic transplantation is complicated and should be made by a multidisciplinary team that includes experts in leukemia and transplantation. Such a team can integrate information regarding patient-specific factors (eg, age, comorbidities, prior therapies), disease biology (eg, cytogenetics), and transplant-related factors (eg, preparative regimen, donor source, and availability) that impact the prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4521020\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor selection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H288784416\"><span class=\"h3\">Sibling donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferred donor for patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for MDS is an HLA-matched sibling. However, fewer than 25 percent of patients in the transplantable age group have an HLA-matched sibling donor. Since MDS patients tend to be older, the availability of matched sibling donors is even lower due to their likely advanced age and comorbidities. For those who do not have an HLA-matched sibling, a fully matched (8 of 8 or 10 of 10) unrelated donor will result in comparable survival rates, but higher TRM. Transplantation with a partially matched (eg, single antigen mismatch) unrelated donor will result in lower survival rates and higher TRM, but is an acceptable alternative depending on the clinical situation.</p><p>Data regarding outcomes following allogeneic HCT with different donors come largely from analyses of HCT registries. Patients in these registries represent a highly select group since, in order to be enrolled, the patient must have been considered eligible for HCT, had a donor, and survived until the time of transplantation. The baseline risk characteristics of patients choosing different donors are likely unbalanced. As an example, the group of patients undergoing transplants from non-sibling or mismatched donors may have had more aggressive disease.</p><p>The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) transplanted over 1300 patients with MDS between 1983 and 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

It also depends on the number of allelic mismatches between donor and recipient that one wishes to allow (eg, a full <span class=\"nowrap\">10/10</span> match or <span class=\"nowrap\">9/10</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">8/10</span> with mismatches).

Most studies have shown relative equivalence of these alternative donor sources, which offer more patients the opportunity for transplant consideration. The relative speed with which the stem cells from these sources can be available offers a significant advantage over matched unrelated donors.</p><p>Due to the relative immaturity of the immune system in umbilical cord samples, stem cells from this source allow the crossing of immunologic barriers that would otherwise be prohibitive. As a result, the degree of HLA-disparity that is tolerable is greater, making this approach more feasible for members of <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> minority groups. In addition, cord blood has already been collected and cryopreserved before the time a match is identified, thereby greatly reducing the time required for accessing the donor and completing the transplant procedure. However, there is less clinical follow-up with cord blood transplantations and long-term follow-up will be necessary to determine whether they truly provide equivalent results.

Umbilical cord blood (ie, the blood remaining in the umbilical cord and placenta following the birth of an infant) has emerged as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells in allogeneic HCT. The optimal product to use for HCT in patients with MDS has yet to be determined. Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) engraft more rapidly than those from bone marrow, but the increased T cell load may result in higher rates of GVHD, particularly chronic GVHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although there are not comparative trials for patients with MDS, we prefer the use of mobilized PBPCs over bone marrow in MDS patients due to the relatively high rate of relapse and the increased use of reduced intensity preparative regimens in this population. For patients without a fully matched donor (sibling or unrelated), we utilize <span class=\"nowrap\">9/10</span> matched unrelated donors. Umbilical cord blood or haploidentical donors can be used as an alternative based on institutional guidelines and experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4521098\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparative regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preparative or conditioning regimen consists of chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy administered to provide adequate immunosuppression to prevent rejection of the transplanted graft and to treat the underlying MDS. Preparative regimens are generally divided into three categories: myeloablative, nonmyeloablative, and reduced-intensity regimens. Myeloablative regimens are preferred for most younger patients with MDS (eg, &lt;55 years of age) because they were the regimens used in the initial studies that demonstrated a benefit for allogeneic HCT in this population. Nonmyeloablative and reduced-intensity regimens may be considered for patients who are not candidates for myeloablative regimens due to comorbidities or who are older. A decision regarding the specific preparative regimen to be used for a particular patient is based on clinical judgement that takes into account recipient comorbidities, disease status, donor, and graft source, as well as the experience and preferences of the transplant center. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H89394187\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Choice of preparative regimen'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9993666\"><span class=\"h3\">Myeloablative regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myeloablative preparative (conditioning) regimens are generally preferred in patients with MDS because such regimens were used in the initial studies that demonstrated a benefit for allogeneic HCT. A myeloablative regimen consists of a single agent or combination of agents expected to destroy the hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and produce profound pancytopenia. The resulting pancytopenia is long-lasting, likely irreversible, and in most instances fatal, unless hematopoiesis is restored by infusion of hematopoietic stem cells. There are many different regimens used. Some combine total body irradiation (TBI) with chemotherapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> plus TBI), while others use chemotherapy alone (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> plus cyclophosphamide).

The use of induction chemotherapy in such patients is controversial. However, due to the extremely poor outcome and difficulty in successfully inducing patients into remission, many transplant centers prefer to proceed directly to transplantation without prior antileukemic chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Such an approach is only relevant for patients able to tolerate myeloablative conditioning.

Allogeneic HCT may be considered for patients with MDS with an HLA-matched sibling donor or a well matched unrelated donor. The decision to pursue this aggressive form of therapy depends on a number of criteria including the original or revised International Prognostic Scoring System MDS risk category (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66149\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66149 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85832 \">table 2</a>), risk of disease progression, risk of infection, overall health of the patient, and the willingness of the patient to take on the risks associated with allogeneic HCT. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Allogeneic HCT'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a high (&gt;4.5 to 6 points) or very high (&gt;6 points) IPSS-R score who are eligible for allogeneic HCT and have an available related or unrelated matched donor, we recommend high intensity chemotherapy followed by allogeneic HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If a donor is not available, these patients may be treated with intensive induction therapy alone, such as that used for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or with a DNA hypomethylating agent with plans to treat with intensive induction therapy at the time of AML transformation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-high-or-very-high-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H48546547\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of high or very high risk myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-high-or-very-high-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H48546554\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of high or very high risk myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'High intensity chemotherapy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options for patients with an intermediate-risk (&gt;3 to 4.5 points) IPSS-R score include those used for patients with low- or very low-risk IPSS-R scores, and the more intensive therapies typically used for patients with high- or very high-risk IPSS-R scores. A choice among these treatments must take into consideration patients' values and preferences, and their interpretation of what constitutes a reasonable survival and reasonable risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intermediate-low-or-very-low-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H17341115\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intermediate, low, or very low risk myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Intermediate-risk IPSS-R'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a very low (&le;1.5 points) or low (&gt;1.5 to 3 points) IPSS-R score are primarily treated with supportive care or low intensity therapies, such as DNA hypomethylating agents or immunosuppressive therapy. This approach is also appropriate for patients with a low- (0 points) or intermediate-1- (0.5 to 1.0 points) risk IPSS score. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intermediate-low-or-very-low-risk-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H519324\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intermediate, low, or very low risk myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred donor for patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for MDS is an HLA-matched sibling. For those who do not have an HLA-matched sibling, a fully matched (8 of 8) unrelated donor, umbilical cord blood donor, and haploidentical related donor are all viable options. Transplantation with a partially matched (7 of 8) unrelated donor will result in lower survival rates and higher treatment-related mortality, but is an acceptable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H4521020\" class=\"local\">'Donor selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-myeloablative and reduced-intensity regimens may be considered for patients who are not candidates for myeloablative regimens due to comorbidities or age, ideally within the context of a clinical trial. A decision regarding specific preparative regimen to use for a particular patient is based on clinical judgement that takes into account details regarding the recipient comorbidities, disease status, donor, and graft source. (See <a href=\"#H4521098\" class=\"local\">'Preparative regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-myeloablative allogeneic HCT appears promising for patients with MDS who are not candidates for myeloablative allogeneic HCT. Early results are encouraging in terms of reduced treatment-related mortality, although significant problems remain (eg, increased relapse risk). Patients should be enrolled in well-designed clinical trials attempting to address the important issues of patient comorbidities, reducing transplant-related complications, graft-versus-host disease, and relapse risk. This approach has limited use for patients with &gt;10 percent bone marrow blasts.
