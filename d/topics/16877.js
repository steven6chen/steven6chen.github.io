These methods also permit estimates of overall and regional blood flow to the thyroid. This topic review will discuss the basic technology of thyroid ultrasonography. The clinical use of thyroid ultrasonography is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical utility of ultrasonography in thyroid disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26548248\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES AND METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid ultrasonography is a technique that requires experience and an understanding of thyroid anatomy and pathology. It cannot be optimally performed by a technician who simply takes pictures and then submits the photographs for later interpretation. Instead, cost-effective testing requires input from both the ordering clinician and the interpreting clinician. The ordering clinician should specify the precise clinical question that must be answered.</p><p>Some endocrinologists prefer to perform the sonogram themselves, while others refer the patient to a sonographer or a radiologist. In some cases, improved efficiency may be obtained when the endocrinologist or surgeon actually performs the sonogram. The endocrinologist, surgeon, or radiologist who does thyroid sonograms must master thyroid palpation, anatomy, and pathophysiology; have special training in ultrasound procedures; meticulous attention to detail; and adequate time to perform a full examination. They must be willing to invest in costly and sophisticated equipment and perform an adequate number of studies to achieve expertise. They cannot merely examine films or digital images. No matter who does the test, results can sometimes be equivocal and misleading.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26548255\"><span class=\"h2\">Gray-scale ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gray-scale ultrasonography involves the intermittent generation of a pulse of sound energy and the reception of reflected echoes to produce an image of the structures traversed by the sound. Current technology produces high-resolution thyroid images by using sound frequencies between 5 and 13 million cycles per second (megahertz [MHz]). These frequencies are well above the range audible by humans and are safe. Sound waves of this frequency pass through air poorly and, therefore, the transducer, the device that generates the sound and receives the echo, must be coupled to the skin with a medium that excludes air.</p><p>The sound waves penetrate tissues, and a portion of the energy is reflected at tissue interfaces up to a depth of 5 cm. The thyroid gland is well within this distance in most patients.</p><p>Current transducers provide high resolution of structures as small as 2 mm, providing their echodensity is different or they are separated by an interface. In contrast, other imaging methods such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and radionuclide scanning detect only nodules that are considerably larger, almost to the centimeter range.</p><p>Some of the technical factors that limit the usefulness of ultrasonography include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attenuation of the high-frequency sound waves in deeper tissues, which may make evaluation of very large goiters difficult</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distortion by air-filled structures such as the trachea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blockade of the signals by calcific deposits in the thyroid, cartilage, or bone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonvisualization of portions of the thyroid gland that lie substernally</p><p/><p>The safety and utility of transtracheal and transbronchial examinations is under investigation.</p><p>Images are best obtained with the patient lying supine with the neck hyperextended. Care should be taken to avoid overextension in patients with limited range of motion in the neck. Landmarks such as the trachea, sternal notch, and the thyroid gland, and thyroid abnormalities should be carefully palpated and their locations noted. The entire region should be examined completely in the transverse plane, starting at the chin and extending to the sternal notch, and in the longitudinal (or &quot;sagittal&quot;) plane, starting in the midline and extending well laterally.</p><p>A 5 to 7 MHz transducer often is used initially to determine the size of the thyroid gland and to assess the regional anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60236\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60236 \">image 1</a>). Then higher-energy transducers of 7.5 to 14 MHz are used to assess details such as nodules and vessels. There are protocols to assemble a mosaic of images to depict a very large thyroid lobe or goiter. A modification of conventional ultrasound, panoramic ultrasound, has been reported to produce images with a large anatomic field of view that displays both lobes of the thyroid gland on a single image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A 10 to 13 MHz transducer may be used to delineate nodules that are 2 to 3 mm in diameter. The value of detecting nodules of this size is debatable, as discussed below, because they are too small to aspirate for cytological examination, and their image may be difficult to reproduce. However, some information is obtained, notably the presence of microcalcifications, reproducible changes in size, or the emergence of a multinodular pattern.</p><p>Doppler techniques can be added to differentiate cystic and vascular structures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26548262\"><span class=\"h2\">Three-dimensional ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography is a technical advance that promises to improve the analysis of anatomic structures and tumors relative to their environment and may enhance diagnosis as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26548269\"><span class=\"h2\">Color-flow Doppler ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Color-flow Doppler imaging is based upon the change in pitch (wave frequency) of a sound that increases when it approaches a listener (the ear or, in the case of ultrasonography, a transducer) and decreases as it departs. Doppler imaging provides information about blood flow to a static gray-scale image and, when superimposed on the real-time gray-scale image, indicates both the direction and the velocity of blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The assignment of color is designed to depict flow in opposite directions as red or blue to simulate but not truly signify arteries and veins. The shade of the color is a semiquantitative indicator of flow velocity. By convention, darker shades indicate slow flow and lighter shades high flow; black signifies no flow or an excessively oblique angle of the Doppler signal to the vascular structure. When viewed in the gray-scale mode, the Doppler flow signal is intensely bright.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26548276\"><span class=\"h2\">B-flow imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>B-flow ultrasonic imaging (BFI) is a non-Doppler technology that depicts motion within anatomic structures. Adjacent ultrasound beams, separated by a specified distance, are transmitted; the reflected signals, which are separated from each other by a shorter predetermined distance, are then detected; overlapping pairs of signals are then assembled and processed. The information correlates with motion, which in the thyroid is blood flow. BFI may avoid artifacts that limit the value of Doppler imaging and thus supplement it.</p><p>In addition, BFI may identify rapidly flashing bright spots, called &quot;twinkling,&quot; which seem to be generated by microcalcifications and may correlate with thyroid cancer. This was illustrated in a study of 479 nodules with histologic confirmation; the presence of four or more B-flow twinkling signs at a distance of greater than 2 mm was associated with 99.6 percent specificity and 65.2 percent sensitivity for papillary thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26548283\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound contrast agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography is likely to improve when images are enhanced with contrast agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. One such agent involves gas-filled microbubbles with a mean diameter less than that of a red blood corpuscle injected intravenously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In one report, a galactose-based ultrasonographic contrast agent, Levovist (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany), showed promise in differentiating benign from malignant thyroid nodules. Cancers showed a significantly earlier arrival time of Levovist than nodular hyperplastic benign nodules and adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Similar results were seen with a different ultrasonographic contrast agent, sulphur hexafluoride [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26548290\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimation of tissue elasticity by ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elastography examines the stiffness of tissue, which may correlate with the palpable consistency of anatomic structures. Using echography, one may infer the deformation of a tissue by observing change in Doppler signal in response to externally applied pressure or vibrations or by tracking something called shear wave propagation. There are several variations on the technical theme. Among them are virtual touch tissue quantification, acoustic force impulse, sonoelastography, and ultrasound elastic imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Investigators are gathering data about the elastic qualities of many different organs and tissues, including the thyroid, to assess the clinical diagnosis of benign and malignant conditions. The tissue being imaged is given what may be envisioned as an elasticity score, typically between 1 and 5, with 1 being the most elastic (easily compressible) and 5 the least elastic (not compressible). The stiffness of malignant thyroid nodules is greater than that of benign nodules. Thus, elastography may enhance the cancer-predictive value of sonography of noncystic, noncalcified thyroid nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In a systematic review of 12 studies (817 benign and 363 malignant thyroid nodules) examining the diagnostic accuracy of sonoelastography for detecting malignant nodules, the highest sensitivity (98.3 percent) was achieved using a threshold elasticity score of between 1 and 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity were 86 and 66.7 percent, respectively, using a threshold elasticity score between 2 and 3. It is uncertain if the addition of sonoelastography to other cancer-predictive ultrasound features (eg, intensity of echoes, sharpness of border) can improve the utility of ultrasound for selecting nodules for fine needle aspiration or for surgery. Sonoelastography has limited value for evaluating cystic or calcified thyroid nodules. In addition, it is uncertain from studies done to date whether high elasticity scores are seen primarily in papillary thyroid cancers and whether the score is of any value in follicular thyroid cancers (which on palpation can be highly vascular and not firm).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26548600\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTIMATION OF THYROID GLAND VOLUME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid ultrasonography is used to answer questions about the size and anatomy of the thyroid gland and adjacent structures in the neck. Using two-dimensional images, a skilled ultrasonographer is able to reconstruct the thyroid in three dimensions. The structural information becomes optimally useful in management when it is integrated with other clinical data.</p><p>Using a low-frequency transducer, the dimensions of each lobe should be determined in the sagittal and transverse planes to determine the length (L), anterior-posterior depth (D), and transverse width (W) of the gland. The volume of the thyroid gland, lobe, or nodule can then be calculated using a simplified formula for a prolate ellipse:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Volume &#160;= &#160;0.5 &#160;x &#160;(L &#160;x &#160;D &#160;x &#160;W)</p></div></div><p>In healthy adults without iodine deficiency, a normal thyroid gland is approximately 4 to 4.8 by 1 to 1.8 by 0.8 to 1.6 cm in size, with a mean volume of 8 to 10 mL (range 3 to 20 mL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>The size of a nodule or a lobe can be measured fairly accurately based on a scale on the sonographic screen or, with advanced equipment, the sonographer can place marks on the image to calculate the dimensions electronically. One study reported imperfect concordance between the dimensions of thyroid nodules as revealed by ultrasound examination when compared with surgical excision. Concordance was 78.5 percent with nodules equal to or smaller of than 1 cm and significantly less for larger nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Minimizing differences between ultrasonographers when estimating the size of large goiters or nodules has been reported when curved-array transducers rather than linear-array equipment is employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Accuracy in estimating volume becomes important when one uses ultrasound measurements to calculate an isotope dose, as an index of iodine intake in epidemiologic studies, or to compare size changes in a nodule over time. Using planimetry from three-dimensional (3D) images reportedly has lower intraobserver variability (3.4 percent) and higher repeatability (96.5 percent) than the standard ellipsoid model for nodules and lobes (14.4 percent variability and 84.8 percent repeatability) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, one must be especially cautious when interpreting reported changes in the volume of nodules based upon ultrasonic volume assessments because it is difficult to reproduce identical two-dimensional image planes for follow-up studies. The variation of ultrasonic thyroid nodule volume determinations among three ultrasonographers with certified experience in thyroid ultrasound was examined in a prospective blinded trial of 42 patients (eight men, 34 women) with 25 uninodular and 17 multinodular thyroid glands. The interobserver variation for the determination of thyroid nodule volume (n = 38) was 48.96 percent for the ellipsoid method of assessing size and 48.64 percent for the planimetric method. Furthermore, the authors reported that a regression analysis revealed that the probability that all three sonographers would identify the same nodule in nodular thyroid glands was 90 percent, if the nodule is at least 15 mm in greatest diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The accuracy of thyroid volume assessment of thyroid volume and improved intraobserver variability and repeatability appears to be achieved with 3D echography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26548607\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERIZATION OF THYROID NODULES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-resolution ultrasonography provides a detailed map of thyroid nodules and helps to characterize the nodules. Solid nodules should be described by using normal thyroid tissue as a reference. Among solid nodules, the intensity of the echo pattern relative to the extranodular thyroid lobe depends upon the transmission or reflection of the ultrasonic signal by the nodule. Hypoechoic, solid nodules transmit the sound energy with minimal reflection while hyperechoic nodules reflect a greater proportion of the signal. Isoechoic nodules interact with the ultrasound in the same way as normal thyroid tissue. The clinical use of ultrasound to identify and characterize nodules is reviewed in detail separately.
