These classification systems are useful for characterizing HIV infection in the United States (CDC) and in the developing world (WHO) and are described briefly below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18840491\"><span class=\"h2\">CDC classification system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2014, the CDC revised the surveillance case definition for HIV infection to incorporate diagnostic testing algorithms that do not rely on Western blot or immunofluorescence HIV antibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95236 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The 2014 surveillance case definition applies to persons of all ages; the previous version had separate case definitions for adults and adolescents &ge;13 years and children younger than 13 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The CDC surveillance case definitions are used primarily for monitoring the HIV infection burden and planning for prevention and care in populations, <strong>not</strong> as the basis for clinical decisions in individual patients. </p><p>The 2014 revised case definition classifies HIV infection in all age groups as stage 1, 2, or 3 based upon the absolute CD4 count unless the individual has had a stage 3 (ie, AIDS-defining) opportunistic illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95235\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95235 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59724 \">table 1</a>). The CD4 percentage is used only when the corresponding CD4 count is unknown, even for young children. Specific criteria are provided for different age groups (&lt;1 year, 1 through 5 years, and &ge;6 years). If no CD4 count or percentage is known, the stage is classified as unknown. If a stage 3 opportunistic illness has been diagnosed, then the stage is 3 regardless of the CD4 absolute count or percentage. The CDC staging system indicates the most severe stage in the individual's lifetime and does not provide for assigning a revised, less severe stage after ART-mediated improvement in HIV-related symptom severity.</p><p>Stage 0 is a new classification that indicates early HIV infection and allows routine monitoring of cases diagnosed within several months after infection. Stage 0 includes the most highly infectious period when viral loads are extremely high and intervention may be most effective in preventing secondary transmission of infection to others. The criteria for stage 0 supersede and are independent of the criteria used for other stages. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18840498\"><span class=\"h2\">World Health Organization classification system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for pediatric <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] uses clinical or immunologic criteria for patients with laboratory-confirmed HIV infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104882 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57988\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57988 \">table 5</a>).

The onset of symptoms may be insidious, with nonspecific symptoms of mild cough, dyspnea, poor feeding, diarrhea, and weight loss. On physical examination, lung auscultation may be normal even in the presence of severe clinical disease and hypoxemia; rales and rhonchi may not become apparent until late in the clinical course.

In a large prospective cohort study in the United States, there was a 50 percent reduction in the incidence of HIV encephalopathy after introduction of combination ART regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, HIV-related neurocognitive deficits can occur even in children on suppressive combination ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>].</p><p>Age and timing of ART initiation are important determinants in the development of HIV encephalopathy. The greatest risk for developing HIV encephalopathy is in the first 12 months of life; more than one-half of children who develop HIV encephalopathy are symptomatic by one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The fact that differences in infant neurodevelopmental functioning can be detected as early as one year of age based on ART treatment suggests that HIV damages the CNS very early in the course of infection and may explain in part why results of studies of HIV-infected children initiating combination ART later in childhood less definitively demonstrate improvement in neurocognitive function after effective ART treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>Patients who attain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) virologic suppression with combination ART therapy have greater improvement in neurocognitive functioning than those who do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Antiretroviral medications variably cross the blood-brain barrier, and in some patients, there may be discordance between CSF and plasma HIV replication and potential for the development of CSF HIV resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

Children appear to follow two basic patterns in the progression of untreated infection: a rapid progression of disease in which children reach severe clinical stages <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunologic progression within the first year of life, or a more typical, slower progression, with clinical and immunologic deterioration by five to six years of life. North American and European cohorts demonstrate this bimodal pattern of disease progression. A minority (15 to 20 percent) of children have rapidly progressive disease with severe immunosuppression, OI, and encephalopathy within the first year of life; about 75 percent of them have severe immunosuppression by 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].

In these children, the first year of life is characterized by the development of mild and nonspecific signs and symptoms (eg, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, parotitis) followed by clinical and immunologic deterioration. Disease progression and immunosuppression are associated with increased susceptibility to OI, the most common cause of morbidity and mortality for HIV-infected individuals. In children, the most common OI are serious bacterial infections, such as pneumonia and bacteremia, followed by herpes zoster, disseminated <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (MAC) infections, and invasive candidal infections of the esophagus or tracheobronchial tree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Timing of HIV transmission from mother to child seems to be an important determinant of disease progression.

The most common AIDS-defining conditions in children in the United States include <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (PCP), recurrent bacterial infections, wasting syndrome, candida esophagitis, HIV encephalopathy, and cytomegalovirus.
