Its transmural nature coupled with the variability of intestinal distribution (ie, which intestinal segment is affected) and systemic, extraintestinal manifestations, gives rise to a spectrum of clinical presentations and risk for long-term sequelae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The primary focus of this topic is the medical management of high-risk patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease in the outpatient setting. This topic also provides an overview of the approach to the acutely ill patient with Crohn disease. Our recommendations are generally consistent with the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines on medical therapy for induction and remission in inflammatory Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-management-of-high-risk-adult-patients-with-moderate-to-severe-crohn-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The risks and benefits of each medical therapy must be discussed with the patient and a shared decision-making process is recommended.</p><p>The management of low-risk patients with mild Crohn disease, the management of patients who have had surgical resection, and surveillance for dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-medical-management-of-mild-low-risk-crohn-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-crohn-disease-after-surgical-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">Management of Crohn disease after surgical resection</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-and-management-of-dysplasia-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease</a></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2855132514\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINING DISEASE ACTIVITY AND SEVERITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials of Crohn disease often use formal grading systems that rely on subjective symptoms to describe disease severity.

Management may include intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement, intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics, nutritional assessment, and consultation with a gastrointestinal surgeon. Some patients may also require treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids or biologic therapy. </p><p>The initial evaluation and management of the acutely ill patient is guided by several factors, including the clinical presentation, severity of illness, history of prior inpatient hospitalizations for complications of Crohn disease (eg, recurrent partial small bowel obstruction), and assessment from gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery specialists.</p><p>The clinical features of complications or flares due to Crohn disease (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea and inadequate oral intake) are broadly overlapping and the need for imaging depends, in part, upon the clinical presentation and prior history. For example, a young patient with Crohn disease and a history of partial small bowel obstruction who previously responded to medical management and now presents with mildly obstructive symptoms may respond to medical management without requiring advanced imaging. For other patients, an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan at the time of hospital admission may help to distinguish among the diagnostic possibilities. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1809890078\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial small bowel obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Partial small bowel obstruction is common in longstanding Crohn disease. The symptoms most commonly associated with acute small bowel obstruction are nausea, vomiting, cramping, abdominal pain, and inability to pass flatus or stool. Small bowel obstruction may result from a stricture causing mechanical obstruction, a stenotic area with superimposed inflammation and spasm, a stenotic area in which undigested food has impacted, an enterolith or, in patients who have had prior surgery, intestinal adhesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H413451751\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentations'</a>.)</p><p>Affected patients most commonly present with partial obstruction and, except in those who have an adhesion, the mechanism is non-strangulating. Medical management with intravenous hydration, nasogastric suction, and parenteral nutrition is often successful, with a response seen within 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-management-of-high-risk-adult-patients-with-moderate-to-severe-crohn-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For patients who do not have proximal small bowel dilation and who have no evidence of long strictures (&gt;10 cm) (on cross sectional imaging), we suggest initial medical management with parenteral glucocorticoids. Surgery is reserved for those patients who do not respond to medical management or who have evidence of small bowel ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative management of Crohn disease of the small bowel, colon, and rectum&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3844492305\"><span class=\"h2\">Localized peritonitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with small bowel Crohn disease may present with fever, chills, and right lower quadrant pain associated with leukocytosis. Patients with such presentation have often suffered a microperforation with localized peritonitis that is contained by the surrounding mesentery and bowel loops. Appendicitis is also a potential source of peritonitis, and an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan at the time of hospital admission may help to distinguish among the diagnostic possibilities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation#H1999561733\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Computed tomography'</a>.)</p><p>The management of localized peritonitis includes bowel rest and empiric antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F106949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106949 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults#H721251431\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial approach to intra-abdominal infections in adults&quot;, section on 'Empiric antimicrobial therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Although medical management is the initial approach, consultation with a gastrointestinal or colorectal surgeon is suggested. A response to intravenous antibiotic therapy is usually seen within three to four days. Most patients will then be transitioned to oral antibiotics, but some patients may require up to two weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy. A subsequent two- to four-week course of outpatient oral therapy with a fluoroquinolone and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>, or equivalent broad spectrum antibiotics, is suggested. Intestinal resection should be considered in nonresponders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum#H60220165\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative management of Crohn disease of the small bowel, colon, and rectum&quot;, section on 'Perforation'</a>.)</p><p>There is some controversy as to the role of glucocorticoids in this setting. For patients already on glucocorticoids, a small increase in the dose may be required. However, for those not previously on glucocorticoids, we suggest withholding glucocorticoids to avoid masking any further clinical deterioration. There are, however, few data to support this concern for increased complications in patients who receive glucocorticoids; one case-control study did find an increased risk of developing an intraabdominal or pelvic abscess in patients with penetrating Crohn disease who received glucocorticoids (OR 9.0; 95% CI 2.4-34.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-medical-management-of-high-risk-adult-patients-with-moderate-to-severe-crohn-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H331427493\"><span class=\"h2\">Abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intra-abdominal abscess may present acutely with fever, abdominal pain and tenderness; however, a walled-off inflammatory mass without infection may present with milder abdominal discomfort and a palpable mass on physical examination.

(See <a href=\"#H215932566\" class=\"local\">'The acutely ill patient with Crohn disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with moderately to severely active Crohn disease, we suggest using a biologic agent (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) inhibitor) in combination with a thiopurine (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> [AZA] or 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP]) compared with monotherapy. This approach is referred to as combination therapy, and the goal is to induce remission. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) (See <a href=\"#H1906727032\" class=\"local\">'Combination therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For high-risk patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease in whom combination therapy is not an option, anti-TNF monotherapy is an effective alternative. (See <a href=\"#H2293617315\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives to combination therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients who achieve clinical, endoscopic and histologic remission with combination therapy, we recommend continued maintenance with the biologic agent. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) While the biologic agent is continued indefinitely, we plan to discontinue the thiopurine in one to two years. Prior to de-escalating the medications, we perform an ileocolonoscopy to confirm mucosal healing and histologic remission, and we obtain anti-TNF drug trough levels to confirm that the anti-TNF drug level is optimized. (See <a href=\"#H4150614030\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have achieved clinical remission with glucocorticoids or for patients who are not candidates for long-term therapy with an anti-TNF agent, thiopurine maintenance therapy is an alternative. (See <a href=\"#H4038529955\" class=\"local\">'Alternative approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transmural inflammatory nature of Crohn disease can lead to the formation of sinus tracts or fistula, enteric fistulas most often connect the intestine to the bladder (enterovesical), skin (enterocutaneous), bowel (enteroenteric), or vagina (enterovaginal). For most patients with fistulizing disease, multidisciplinary care from both gastroenterology and colorectal surgery is important, and we recommend consultation with a surgeon with expertise in inflammatory bowel disease.
