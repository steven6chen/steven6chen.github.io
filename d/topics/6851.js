(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, these measurements often cannot establish the presence or absence of adrenal insufficiency and cannot distinguish among the three disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that can cause deficient cortisol secretion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A primary adrenal disorder resulting in deficiency of cortisol (primary adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pituitary disorder resulting in deficiency of corticotropin (ACTH) secretion (secondary adrenal insufficiency)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hypothalamic disorder resulting in deficiency of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and secondarily of ACTH (tertiary adrenal insufficiency)</p><p/><p>While the history, such as prior pituitary surgery, glucocorticoid therapy, or tuberculosis, may provide strong clues to the site of possible adrenal deficiency, measurement of plasma ACTH and the responses of the anterior pituitary gland and adrenal cortex to a variety of stimuli will confirm the diagnosis and define the site at which the defect exists. The stimuli used include ACTH, metyrapone-induced hypocortisolemia, and, rarely, insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The low-dose and high-dose ACTH stimulation tests have supplanted insulin-induced hypoglycemia in clinical practice (except in patients suspected to have very recent loss of ACTH secretory capacity). The results are similar to those obtained with insulin-induced hypoglycemia; in addition, ACTH tests can be performed without a clinician being present and are less expensive.</p><p>The low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> is intermediate in sensitivity between the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> test and the insulin-induced hypoglycemia or high-dose ACTH stimulation test. It may detect more subtle deficiency in cortisol secretion than the latter test because plasma ACTH does not increase as much [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; however, the clinical importance of this finding is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR DYNAMIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major problem with relying on unstimulated serum cortisol values as the basis for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is that cortisol secretion is episodic. A single early morning serum cortisol value, if it falls within the range of normal, is inconclusive, although a patient with adrenal insufficiency is very unlikely to have a high-normal value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Furthermore, the normal range is broad, and a patient can have pituitary or adrenal insufficiency but maintain basal corticotropin (ACTH) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cortisol secretion within the range of normal. In patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the range of basal concentrations of serum cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and other adrenal steroids overlap the normal range. For these reasons, dynamic function tests should be performed when there is doubt about the status of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.</p><p>Nevertheless, an early morning serum cortisol value can be very helpful in excluding adrenal insufficiency. A serum cortisol concentration greater than 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (300 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> makes it unlikely that the patient has clinically important HPA insufficiency; in contrast, a value below 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (80 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> makes adrenal insufficiency very likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Similarly, a salivary cortisol concentration at 8 AM above 5.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (16 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> excludes adrenal insufficiency, whereas a value below about 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> makes the probability of adrenal insufficiency high. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-cortisol-in-serum-and-saliva\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of cortisol in serum and saliva&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Dynamic testing is performed to establish the diagnosis in patients with equivocal serum cortisol values in whom hypoadrenalism is suspected. With simultaneous measurement of the plasma ACTH, these tests can also distinguish between primary and secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. Distinction between hypothalamic and pituitary causes of hypoadrenalism is made by assessing the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible adrenal crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is essential that treatment of patients who present in possible adrenal crisis not be delayed while diagnostic tests are performed. Blood for serum cortisol and serum chemistry should be drawn and therapy initiated immediately with intravenous (IV) saline and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Adrenal crisis'</a>). The short <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> can be performed after initiation of glucocorticoid treatment provided that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid therapy has not been given for more than a few days, after which it could begin to suppress the HPA axis and compromise the adrenal response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neither <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> (cortisol) nor cortisone (which is converted to cortisol by the liver) is given because both are measured in cortisol radioimmunoassays. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexamethasone</a>, which is not measured in these assays, is the glucocorticoid of choice in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTH STIMULATION TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several protocols have been used to assess the response to exogenous corticotropin (ACTH). The agent used is synthetic ACTH (1-24) (cosyntropin), which has the full biologic potency of native ACTH (1-39). Short (one hour or less) tests involve administration of a single-dose in a &quot;low&quot; or &quot;high&quot; concentration and can be performed on an outpatient basis. Both tests result in supraphysiological plasma ACTH concentrations: about 60,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (1320 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> after the standard high-dose ACTH test and about 1900 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (41.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> after the low-dose test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There are no untoward side effects. Allergic reactions are almost unheard of with cosyntropin. Prolonged ACTH stimulation tests are seldom performed because measurements of plasma ACTH in conjunction with the low-dose ACTH test provide the necessary information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Standard high-dose ACTH stimulation test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This test consists of measuring serum cortisol immediately before and 30 and 60 minutes after intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection of 250 mcg (85 nmol, or 40 international units) of cosyntropin, which represents the entire contents of the vial. This dose of cosyntropin results in pharmacologic plasma ACTH concentrations for the 60-minute duration of the test.</p><p>The advantage of the high-dose test is that the cosyntropin can be injected IM as well as IV, because pharmacologic plasma ACTH concentrations are still achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The low-dose test has not been evaluated after IM injection and may not provide valid results by this route.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-dose ACTH stimulation test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A test involving more physiological plasma concentrations of ACTH theoretically provides a more sensitive index of adrenocortical responsiveness. The low-dose ACTH test is performed by measuring serum cortisol immediately before and 30 minutes after IV injection of cosyntropin (synthetic ACTH [1-24]) in a dose either of 1 <strong>mcg</strong> (160 milli-international units) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] or of 0.5 mcg (80 milli-international units) per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The 0.5 mcg per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> dose has the advantage of compensating for plasma volume, but it is about one-half the 1 mcg dose in most patients and may not result in the same peak serum cortisol concentrations at 30 minutes because the peak tends to be reached earlier and is 30 percent lower than after insulin-induced hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Furthermore, doses of 0.6 mcg and 0.8 mcg resulted in significantly lower responses than 1 mcg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Because a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> has not been studied in patients whose surface area varied significantly from 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, it should be used with caution in such patients. Because it may lead to lower peak cortisol values, a normal result can be interpreted with confidence. By contrast a subnormal response may result if the ACTH dose is insufficient.</p><p>Plasma ACTH can also be measured in the basal sample, as in all ACTH stimulation tests. In healthy individuals, cortisol responses are greatest in the morning, but in patients with adrenal insufficiency, the response to cosyntropin is the same in the morning and afternoon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, we recommend that the test be done in the morning to minimize the risk of misdiagnosis in a normal individual. This dose stimulates maximal adrenocortical secretion up to 30 minutes post-injection and, in normal subjects, results in a peak plasma ACTH concentration about twice that of insulin-induced hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>There is no commercially available preparation of &quot;low-dose&quot; cosyntropin. One prepares the low-dose solution of cosyntropin locally; the vials of cosyntropin currently available contain 250 mcg and come with sterile normal saline solution to be used as diluent. Instructions are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inject 1 mL of the diluent into the vial of cosyntropin to produce a 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> solution and shake thoroughly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a 1 mL tuberculin syringe, withdraw 0.2 mL (ie, 50 mcg cosyntropin) and inject it into a vial containing 24.8 mL of sterile normal saline solution to produce a 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> solution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After shaking thoroughly, again using a 1 mL syringe, withdraw 0.5 mL (1 mcg cosyntropin) or the appropriate volume for the patient's surface area, and inject the entire volume immediately IV.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Eight-hour ACTH stimulation test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eight-hour test, which is now rarely performed, consists of infusing 250 mcg (40 international units) of cosyntropin continuously over eight hours in 500 mL of isotonic saline. A 24-hour urine specimen is collected the day before and the day of the infusion for cortisol or 17-hydroxycorticoid (17-OHCS) and creatinine determination, and serum cortisol is determined at the end of the infusion. Plasma ACTH concentrations are supraphysiologic throughout the infusion.</p><p>The infusion solution must contain isotonic saline (154 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> NaCl) because patients with adrenal insufficiency, who may already be hyponatremic and lack aldosterone, can become severely hyponatremic if given hypotonic solutions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-and-hyperkalemia-in-adrenal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in adrenal insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Two-day ACTH infusion test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two-day ACTH infusion test is similar to the eight-hour infusion test, except that the same dose of ACTH is infused for eight hours on two consecutive days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Daily 1 mg IM injections of long-acting ACTH (1-18)-NH2 can be used outside the United States.</p><p>This test may be helpful in distinguishing secondary from tertiary adrenal insufficiency (see below). The one-day eight-hour test is too short for this purpose, while longer tests add little further useful information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL VALUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The current criteria used to indicate normal adrenal function are a minimum serum cortisol concentration &ge;18 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (500 to 550 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> before <strong>or</strong> after corticotropin (ACTH) injection as described for each test below.</p><p>Previous criteria that required a minimum increment in serum cortisol (eg, 3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [90 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] are invalid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], because individuals who have a high basal serum cortisol concentration, due either to normal circadian rhythmicity or acute stress, may be nearly maximally stimulated and unable to increase cortisol secretion further. In addition, approximately 20 percent of normal subjects with high-normal basal serum cortisol concentration have little or no rise after ACTH. It is therefore important to obtain both baseline and post-ACTH cortisol samples for accurate assessment of adrenal function.</p><p>Furthermore, individuals may meet criteria for serum cortisol increment (eg, 3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [90 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> with absolute values that clearly indicate adrenal insufficiency.

However, these are not clinically useful criteria, as up to 43 percent of normal individuals would be diagnosed as having adrenal insufficiency when these criteria are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cortisol assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variability in cortisol assays creates an additional problem with setting criteria for a normal response to ACTH that apply to all centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/10,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16-18</a>]. Two studies comparing cortisol results obtained with different assays showed a positive bias of radioimmunoassays and immunofluorometric enzyme assays of 10 to 50 percent compared with a reference value obtained using isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>]. As a result, in one study, depending on the combination of assay and criterion used, between 0 and 100 percent of healthy volunteers would be considered to have a normal response to ACTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Further studies are needed to determine whether the low-dose test is preferable in specific clinical circumstances.</p><p>Data indicate that the low-dose test (like the 250 mcg test) is not valid if there has been recent pituitary injury, and supports the conclusion that a 30-minute serum cortisol concentration less than 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> indicates impaired adrenocortical reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

There are two ways to distinguish among them:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of plasma ACTH in the basal sample.

In primary adrenal insufficiency, prolonged stimulation results in little, if any, increase in cortisol production. In secondary adrenal insufficiency, on the other hand, the adrenal gland is intrinsically normal but is atrophic because of chronic ACTH deficiency. In most of these patients, stimulation for one day (eight hours) is too brief to exert a major effect. Continuous infusion of ACTH for two days results in an increase in 24-hour urinary 17-hydroxycorticoid (17-OHCS) excretion to 9 mg (25 nmol) or more during the second day of infusion in most patients with hypopituitarism. Occasional patients may require three to five days of stimulation. However, even after five days, serum cortisol concentrations may not attain those reached after one to eight hours of ACTH stimulation in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and 24-hour urinary 17-OHCS may increase only threefold over baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>With the availability of accurate measurements of basal plasma ACTH, prolonged ACTH infusion tests have become unnecessary for determining the cause of adrenal insufficiency and should be considered as confirmatory tests only in patients with equivocal plasma ACTH values.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">STRESS AND SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An area in which there continues to be controversy is whether the high-dose corticotropin (ACTH) test accurately predicts the ability of a patient to respond adequately to stress, such as major surgery. The controversy is based upon the observation that occasional patients have normal responses to cosyntropin, but subnormal responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], although the hypoglycemia has not always been adequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The clinical importance of these discrepant results is uncertain. Rare patients who respond normally to the high-dose ACTH test have a subnormal serum cortisol response to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; however, these patients tolerate surgery normally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Furthermore, the serum cortisol responses of most patients to the high-dose ACTH test and to insulin-induced hypoglycemia are very similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The presumed reason is that the endogenous ACTH secretion elicited in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia is maximally stimulating during the hour or less that the test lasts, as are the plasma concentrations of exogenous ACTH achieved during the high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a>. In contrast, the plasma ACTH concentrations achieved in the low-dose ACTH test are not maximally stimulating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>].</p><p>In all three tests, a normal serum cortisol response is predicated upon the fact that the adrenal gland has been stimulated with sufficient endogenous ACTH each day to prevent adrenal atrophy and maintain the basal activity of the steroidogenic enzymes. The reason patients do well during major surgery, even though their serum cortisol concentrations may not rise normally in response to ACTH or the surgery, may be that more than basal daily cortisol secretion is not needed to survive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Recent ACTH deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outside of the critical care setting, with one exception, any patient who responds normally to the high-dose ACTH test does not require glucocorticoid supplementation for stress, surgical or otherwise. The exception is the patient who is acutely ACTH-deficient, as might occur soon after pituitary surgery or brain or pituitary stalk trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>During the several days after cessation of ACTH secretion, the zonae fasciculata and reticularis of the adrenals undergo functional and anatomical atrophy. However, during part of that interval the adrenals may respond normally to pharmacologic doses of ACTH, whereas the pituitary gland is unable to release ACTH in response to stress. Therefore, these patients will respond normally to the high-dose ACTH test, but fail to respond to insulin-induced hypoglycemia (since they cannot increase ACTH secretion). Such patients, who can usually be identified by their history, require glucocorticoid supplementation during surgical or other stresses.</p><p>In patients who have undergone pituitary surgery, the cortisol response to standard-dose ACTH testing correlates well with the results of an insulin-induced hypoglycemia test if performed at least four weeks after surgery. In a study of 41 patients who were evaluated using standard-dose ACTH and insulin-induced hypoglycemia testing at one and four to six weeks after pituitary surgery (Cushing's disease excluded), all patients with a 30-minute serum cortisol after a standard-dose ACTH test of less than 12.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (350 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> four to six weeks post-op had a subnormal response to hypoglycemia, while those with a serum cortisol greater than 23.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (650 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> had a normal response to hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].
