Cephalothin was active against most gram-positive cocci (including penicillinase-producing staphylococci), but did not have clinically useful activity against enterococci, <em>Listeria</em>, methicillin-resistant staphylococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporins/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], or penicillin-resistant pneumococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporins/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

Gram-negative cocci (such as the gonococcus and meningococcus) and <em>H. influenzae</em> were generally resistant.

Although cefuroxime is approved for the therapy of <em>H. influenzae</em> meningitis, delayed responses and treatment failures have occurred, and a third generation cephalosporin is now preferred for therapy of meningitis due to ampicillin-resistant strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporins/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cefuroxime is also highly active against beta-lactamase producing <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Cephamycin subgroup (active against Bacteroides)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cephamycin subgroup of the second generation cephalosporins includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotetan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotetan</a>. This subgroup is active against most strains of <em>E. coli</em>, <em>P. mirabilis</em>, and <em>Klebsiella</em>, like the first generation cephalosporins. The cephamycins are quite stable to many plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but the activity of this group against <em>Enterobacter</em> and indole-positive <em>Proteus</em> is limited by induction of chromosomal cephalosporinases of these species and selection of stably derepressed mutants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporins/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Unlike the first generation cephalosporins, the cephamycins are active against many strains of <em>Bacteroides</em>. The combination of activity against common aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli plus <em>Bacteroides</em> has led to the use of the cephamycins in the prophylaxis and therapy of infections in the abdominal and pelvic cavities (where these organisms predominate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporins/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The cephamycins have no clear advantages over the first generation cephalosporins for infections outside of the abdominal and pelvic areas.</p><p>Overall resistance rates to cephamycins range from 10 to 80 percent for different members of the <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em> group, compared with 15 to 30 percent for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, and essentially no resistance for the carbapenems, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporins/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Third generation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The third generation cephalosporin class [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporins/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] is marked by stability to the common beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacilli, and these compounds are highly active against Enterobacteriaceae (<em>E. coli</em>, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, indole-positive <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>, <em>Enterobacter</em>, <em>Serratia</em>, <em>Citrobacter</em>), <em>Neisseria</em>, and <em>H. influenzae</em>. They are the therapy of choice for gram-negative meningitis due to susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Third generation cephalosporins may also be useful alternatives to the aminoglycosides in treating gram-negative infections resistant to other beta-lactams, particularly in the patient with renal dysfunction. However, mutants of <em>Enterobacter</em>, indole-positive <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Serratia</em>, and <em>Citrobacter</em>, with stable derepression of the chromosomal beta-lactamase, are resistant to these antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporins/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. Even if these organisms (<em>Enterobacter</em>, indole-positive <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Serratia</em>, and <em>Citrobacter</em>) test susceptible to cephalosporins, use of a third generation cephalosporin as a single agent for treatment of serious infections due to these bacteria can lead to the emergence of resistance during therapy.</p><p>The third generation cephalosporins are less active against most gram-positive organisms than the first generation cephalosporins and are inactive against enterococci, <em>Listeria</em>, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and <em>Acinetobacter</em>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cefotaxime</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> are usually active against pneumococci with intermediate susceptibility to penicillin, but strains fully resistant to penicillin are often resistant to the third generation cephalosporins as well.

Within this subgroup, cefotaxime has the shortest serum half-life (1 hour) because of partial metabolism in the liver to desacetyl-cefotaxime.

Ceftazidime is quite stable to the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and is highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, <em>Neisseria</em>, and <em>H. influenzae</em>. Ceftazidime is also particularly active against <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and is an effective therapy for serious infections due to <em>P. aeruginosa</em> when the organism is resistant to the anti-pseudomonal penicillins or the patient is penicillin allergic. In addition, it is effective therapy for meningitis caused by <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. As with the anti-pseudomonal penicillins, however, ceftazidime should generally be given at least initially in combination with an aminoglycoside for treatment of serious <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection, when susceptibilities are unknown.

Like the earlier third generation agents, it is active against the Enterobacteriaceae, <em>Neisseria</em>, and <em>H. influenzae</em> but has greater activity against the gram-negative enterics that have a broad-spectrum, inducible, chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase (<em>Enterobacter</em>, indole-positive <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Citrobacter</em>, and <em>Serratia</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporins/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

As with the anti-pseudomonal penicillins, cefepime should generally be given in combination with an aminoglycoside for treatment of serious <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection when susceptibilities are unknown. There has not been enough clinical experience with cefepime in meningitis to recommend its routine use for this purpose. It is also not currently recommended for prophylactic use in surgery. <em>Acinetobacter</em> isolates are frequently resistant to cefepime. </p><p>Despite these potential advantages over third generation cephalosporins, especially against organisms with inducible, chromosomal resistance, comparative trials of third and fourth generation cephalosporins have not yet been performed.</p><p>A review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a> safety data was initiated in 2007 following findings of a meta-analysis that raised concern regarding increased all-cause mortality associated with cefepime use (risk ratio 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.49) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporins/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].
