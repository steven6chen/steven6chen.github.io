These effusions typically develop in patients with thickened and sometimes calcified pleural surfaces in the setting of chronic pleural inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], although they have been reported without pleural thickening in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chylothoraces, by comparison, are much more common and contain a high concentration of triglycerides in the form of chylomicrons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/1,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9-11</a>]. A chylothorax arises when lymph fluid from the thoracic duct or other lymphatic channels accumulates in the pleural space due to disruption or obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of chylothorax&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20969434\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of cholesterol effusions is uncertain. A traditional theory proposes that lysis of erythrocytes and neutrophils in pleural fluid releases cholesterol and other lipid constituents from degenerating cell membranes; these compounds are &quot;trapped&quot; in the pleural space by the thickened pleural membranes. Eventually, these lipid constituents become concentrated and impart the milky quality to the pleural fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The finding of cholesterol pleural effusions in patients without pleural fibrosis, however, suggests that a more active but yet-to-be defined intrapleural process may exist that concentrates cholesterol in pleural fluid. One theory to explain this observation is that the pleural cholesterol is derived from serum lipids bound to low density lipoproteins (LDL) that accumulate in the pleural space during acute inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Over time, lipoprotein binding of cholesterol shifts from LDLs to high density lipoproteins (HDL). The mechanism for this shift in lipoprotein binding is not known.</p><p>Most likely, different mechanisms of pathogenesis exist in different clinical settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86708465\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any condition associated with a chronic pleural effusion with or without thickened pleural membranes can result in a cholesterol effusion. In the past, one of the more common causes was induced pneumothorax therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. At present, the two most common etiologies of cholesterol effusion are tuberculous and chronic rheumatoid pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a systematic review of 62 studies of 104 reported cases in which underlying causes of cholesterol effusions were diagnosed in 87 cases, 51 percent (44 cases) were due to tuberculosis, 38 percent (33 cases) rheumatoid arthritis, and the remainder attributed to other diagnoses that included paragonimiasis (3 cases), yellow nail syndrome (2 cases), iatrogenic (2 cases), hydatidosis (1 case), Demons-Meigs syndrome (1 case), malignant pleural effusion (1 case), and uncertain etiology (17 cases). Seventeen additional cases had unknown or unreported underlying diagnoses. A cholesterol effusion can develop in the setting of pleural scarring from tuberculosis, despite successful treatment of the infection. In a series of 11 patients with cholesterol effusions who had previously undergone pneumothorax therapy for tuberculous, progressive pleural thickening developed over the subsequent 5 to 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Rare causes of cholesterol effusions include pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis, hepatopulmonary echinococcosis, chronic hemothorax, chronic pneumothorax, syphilis, and lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/1,4,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,13-15</a>]. Cholesterol effusions have also been associated with alcoholism, heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, and Hodgkin disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20969441\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H228620587\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a cholesterol effusion may have no chest symptoms or may present with the insidious onset of dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/1,2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,16</a>]. Chest pain is not a frequent complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Symptoms of an underlying disease (eg, weight loss, fever, night sweats, arthralgias, joint stiffness) are sometimes present.

Typically, patients have a history of pleural disease dating back five years or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, in a case series of six patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the duration of symptoms associated with the cholesterol effusions was relatively brief (median 15 months) and the pleura was normal or only minimally thickened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Rapid onset of a cholesterol effusion has also been reported in two patients with tuberculous pleurisy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and a patient with hepatothoracic echinococcus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Patients with paragonimiasis are typically from an endemic area (eg, Asia, Africa, and South America) and report consuming raw shellfish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/14,15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,18</a>]. A recent onset of symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, is often reported and effusions may be bilateral.

The history can help to distinguish between these disorders; patients with a cholesterol effusion typically have long-standing pleural disease, patients with chylothorax often have recent thoracic or neck surgery or other conditions that can disrupt the thoracic duct, and those with empyema often have associated cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain.

As an example, in a review of 53 patients, therapeutic thoracentesis was performed in 47 (88 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Recurrence of pleural fluid was reported in 64 percent, some of whom responded to repeat thoracentesis. Complications of pneumothorax and empyema were reported in a small number of patients.

Trapped lung is a consequence of remote pleural inflammation, while lung entrapment is a consequence of active pleural inflammation. Thus, remote pneumothorax therapy can cause trapped lung and rheumatoid pleuritis can cause lung entrapment. The key feature of both of these processes is that the underlying lung is unable to re-expand completely after thoracentesis, causing a pneumothorax or rapid reaccumulation of pleural fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of pleural causes of unexpandable lung&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of pleural causes of unexpandable lung&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Assessment for trapped lung or lung entrapment is best performed by monitoring pleural pressures during thoracentesis to ascertain re-expansion of the underlying lung. If the lung cannot re-expand, pleural space elastance (the change in pleural pressure divided by the amount of pleural fluid removed) will exceed 14.5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O per liter of fluid removed. In the absence of pleural manometry, fluid removal is stopped at the point the patient feels chest discomfort.

However, if the fluid recurs more rapidly, we consider decortication to avoid risks of empyema and pleurocutaneous fistula associated with repetitive thoracentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions/abstract/10,16,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86713735\"><span class=\"h2\">Decortication/pleurectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thoracotomy with decortication or pleurectomy is a major surgical procedure in which a peel or fibrous layer is dissected off the pleural surfaces to allow re-expansion of a trapped lung. Depending on the extent of fibrosis, decortication may require a partial pleurectomy to achieve full re-expansion.&nbsp;Some surgeons will also do a pleurodesis procedure during decortication to obliterate the pleural space and prevent the reaccumulation of a cholesterol effusion. Pleurodesis is accomplished by mechanical abrasion of the parietal pleural surface with a dry gauze sponge or by chemical pleurodesis.
