Factors associated with a satisfactory childbirth experience include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal expectations that were realized</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality of caregiver support and rapport with the caregiver</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability to participate in decision making</p><p/><p>These factors may be as important as the effects of pain, pain-relief measures, obstetrical interventions, labor characteristics, demographics, birth environment, and preparation.</p><p>Issues relating to nonmedical labor support, particularly continuous support by a doula, will be reviewed here. General issues about childbirth education and preparation for labor and delivery are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparation for labor and childbirth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H377138020\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS CONTINUOUS LABOR SUPPORT?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous labor support refers to continuous, nonmedical care of laboring women. Providing this type of support is a core function of the work of a doula. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'The doula'</a> below.)</p><p>The elements of labor support include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention to physical comfort (eg, touch and massage; assistance with positioning, bathing, grooming; applying heat or cold)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotional support (praise, reassurance, encouragement, and continuous presence)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guidance and emotional support for the partner or loved ones</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Information (nonmedical advice, explanations of procedures, anticipatory guidance)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advocacy (facilitation of communication between the woman and hospital staff to assist her in making informed decisions)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While continuous labor support may be provided by different people (medically trained, professional, lay, etc), the benefits of this support accrue most consistently when care is provided by a trained professional who is not a member of the hospital staff or family member or friend, someone like a doula (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'The doula'</a> below). A nurturing, supportive companion during labor has obvious psychological benefits, and almost all women prefer frequent or continuous support during labor to help them cope with challenges, including pain and uncertainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Anxiety during labor increases catecholamine levels, and adrenergic stimulation may have unfavorable effects on labor progress and fetal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Decreasing anxiety may have both obstetrical and psychological benefits. In a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 randomized trials that assessed the effects of continuous one-to-one intrapartum support compared with usual care in over 15,000 laboring women, continuous one-to-one support provided by trained or untrained individuals resulted in small but statistical beneficial effects across a variety of healthcare settings and socioeconomic and ethnic groups, and no harms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These benefits included:</p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in spontaneous vaginal births (relative risk [RR] 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12, 21 trials, 14,369 women)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in cesarean delivery (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64-0.88; 24 trials, 15,347 women)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in need of medication for pain relief (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.96, 15 trials, 12,433 women)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in instrumented vaginal delivery (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85-0.96; 19 trials, 14,118 women)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in length of labor (weighted mean difference -0.69 hours, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.34; 13 trials, 5429 women)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in rate of low five-minute Apgar scores (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46-0.85; 14 trials, 12,615 women), but no significant reduction in admission to the special-care nursery or prolonged hospital stay</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in negative childbirth experiences (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.798, 11 trials, 11,133 women)</p><p/><p>Although continuous labor support resulted in minimal reduction in use of epidural anesthesia (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.99, 9 trials, 11,444 women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], the magnitude of this effect appears to depend on the population and the quality of labor support. Larger reductions in use of epidural anesthesia have been reported in trials that enrolled low-income women who would have otherwise labored alone, who received continuous labor support early in labor, and who received support by trained doulas rather than nurses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the indigent population, women accompanied by doulas reduced epidural use by at least 70 percent, compared with those without doulas (approximately 7 percent versus 23 to 55 percent without a doula) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] whereas, in more economically advantaged populations, the use of epidural was the same with or without a doula or only slightly decreased (eg, 54 versus 66 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/4,5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,13</a>].</p><p>Of note, the meta-analysis was dominated by a large (n = 6915 women) randomized trial in 13 North American hospitals that did not find significant medical benefits from continuous labor support provided by specially trained labor nurses, compared with usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The rate of cesarean delivery, the primary outcome measure, was approximately 13 percent in each group. There were no clinically important differences in use of regional anesthesia (68 versus 70 percent in the usual-care group), duration of labor after randomization (6.6 hours), or neonatal outcome. The absence of significant medical benefits from nurse support in this large trial contributed to the borderline findings of the meta-analysis. These findings may have occurred because a nurse, who must also monitor one or more patients' medical status, may be less able to provide effective emotional and physical support during labor than an individual, such as a doula, whose primary function is to provide continuous labor support. The nurses in this trial changed with each shift and were present only 80 percent of the time, while the role of the doula is to remain with the woman continuously throughout labor until delivery. In addition, it has been hypothesized that the nurses may have been more likely than doulas to support standard institutional patterns of pharmacologic pain relief adjuvants, confounding possible effects of these agents on the cesarean delivery rate. The potential impact of these factors was suggested by subgroup analysis of the meta-analysis, which noted that the largest effect (favoring continuous support) was observed in the group of women whose support person was not a member of the hospital staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Lastly, this trial included a high proportion of highly educated, white women who gave birth in hospitals with high rates of routine medical interventions (eg, use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>, electronic fetal monitoring, and regional anesthesia), supporting the hypothesis that continuous labor support in this population is less likely to influence use of epidural analgesia.</p><p>Continuous labor support may also have economic benefits. A study comparing data from doula-attended births among Minnesota Medicaid recipients with Medicaid-supported singleton births in the United States concluded that, if the observed reduction in cesarean delivery was causal, Medicaid coverage for doula care may reduce overall costs by lowering the cesarean delivery rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Similar calculations were reported for birth in Wisconsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Others have reported that access to culturally appropriate doula care may facilitate higher rates of breastfeeding initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In a joint statement on safe prevention of primary cesarean delivery, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM) noted that &quot;one of the most effective tools to improve labor and delivery outcomes is the continuous presence of support personnel, such as a doula&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">THE DOULA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A doula is a person trained and experienced in childbirth who provides physical, emotional, and informational support to a woman before, during, and after she gives birth. She stays with a laboring woman continuously, with only brief breaks for meals. She provides comfort, emotional and physical support, information, and advocacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. She does not replace medical staff, perform clinical or medical tasks, or intervene in clinical care but can facilitate communication and help the woman gain a better understanding of the labor process, medical procedures, options for coping with pain and uncertainty, and possible complications of labor or delivery.</p><p>Women consistently report that having a doula has positive effects on their ability to cope with labor and their childbirth and postpartum experiences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/5-7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,21</a>]. As discussed above (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Benefits'</a> above), a person who is not also responsible for monitoring the mother's medical condition may provide more effective support than hospital staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These non-staff, nonmedical caregivers can focus on the woman and her specific needs, whereas the hospital staff has duties beyond labor support and may be constrained by competing patient demands and institutional policies and routine practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A survey of postpartum women in the United States found that only 6 percent had doula support during labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Of those who did not have a doula but understood what doula care involved, 22 percent of non-Hispanic white women, 39 percent of non-Hispanic black women, and 30 percent of Hispanic women said they would like to have had doula care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607721620\"><span class=\"h2\">Finding a doula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, some hospitals have programs that offer doulas to laboring women on admission to labor and delivery units. These doulas are volunteers or hospital employees and may provide care at no cost, for a nominal fee, or on a fee-for-service basis. Some hospitals that serve a large non-English-speaking population may provide bilingual doulas. Hospital doulas are familiar with their institution's routine and have a preexisting rapport with members of the staff. In this model, a laboring woman is paired with a doula on call, and the doula stays with woman until she delivers.</p><p>Some women hire a private doula during pregnancy to offer prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum support (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95225 \">table 1</a>). A private doula may meet with her client prenatally to develop a birth plan, discuss intentions, answer questions, and provide opportunities for education and support. A private doula may go to her client's home in early labor and then accompany her to the hospital or meet the laboring woman on the labor floor. Some private doulas also offer postpartum services, visiting the new mother and her newborn and helping with household chores and breastfeeding advice. Fees vary in different parts of the country, depending on the services provided, and may range from USD $500 to $1500. Minnesota and Oregon have passed legislation for Medicaid to cover doula services, and some private payers offer reimbursement. Women who choose to hire a private doula should meet with her before the birth and discuss her past experience and general philosophy toward birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607722128\"><span class=\"h2\">Training and accreditation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several organizations provide training and accreditation for doulas. Program specifics differ, but all four major organizations described below require candidates to complete a required reading list and a three-day training program, audit a childbirth education class, attend a number of births, and receive positive evaluations from laboring women and healthcare providers. For example, Doulas of North America (DONA) requirements include training, workshops, and attending at least three births with labor lasting at least 15 hours, with positive evaluations from all three clients.</p><p>Training a lay female companion or medical interpreter to be a doula are strategies used in some studies for providing continuous labor support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. A trial at a United States hospital randomly assigned 600 low-risk, nulliparous women with a female <span class=\"nowrap\">friend/relative</span> willing to be her companion during labor to usual care or to a program in which the female companion was trained to act as a lay doula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most study participants were young and unmarried. An experienced doula met with the woman and her chosen companion for two two-hour training sessions prior to the birth. Lay-doula support was associated with significantly reduced length of labor (10.4 versus 11.7 hours) and with a higher proportion of infants with five-minute Apgar scores &gt;6 (99.7 versus 97 percent). There were no differences between groups in the cesarean birth rate. At six to eight weeks postpartum, mothers in the lay-doula group were more likely to rate their overall birth experience as &quot;very good&quot; (59 versus 26 percent) and described more positive perceptions of their infant, support from others, and their own self-worth. In addition, mothers in the doula group were more likely to report that their labor and birth experience had a very positive effect on their feelings about the medical center.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607722049\"><span class=\"h2\">Doula referral organizations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospitals and prenatal care providers may be good resources for finding doulas in a community.
