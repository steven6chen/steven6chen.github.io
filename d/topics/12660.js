The simplest division of the scleroderma-related disorders is into localized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60398\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60398 \">table 1</a>) and systemic forms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80559\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80559 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-classification-of-scleroderma-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and classification of scleroderma disorders&quot;</a>). Patients with the systemic forms are more likely to have internal organ involvement, which is usually the target of therapy.</p><p>Differentiating between localized and systemic disease and understanding of the systemic sclerosis (SSc) subsets, disease staging, and organ involvement are needed to guide effective use of available therapies.</p><p>The etiology and pathogenesis of the scleroderma disorders are poorly understood. As a result, treatment of these conditions is difficult, incomplete, and not curative.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undifferentiated-systemic-rheumatic-connective-tissue-diseases-and-overlap-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undifferentiated systemic rheumatic (connective tissue) diseases and overlap syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Certain autoantibodies are associated with disease subsets and may help predict the risk of future organ involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F59732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59732 \">table 3</a>). Detailed discussions of the classification of disease subsets and clinical manifestations of SSc are presented separately.

These patients are generally managed in a way similar to those classified as having the limited cutaneous SSc subset, with a focus on vascular symptoms and internal organ complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;, section on 'Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9866617\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing disease severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of the initial pretreatment assessment is to determine the distribution of organ involvement and, if possible, to decide whether organ dysfunction is related to potentially reversible inflammation or vasoconstriction (active disease) or whether the damage is irreversible with available therapies (eg, fibrosis or ischemic necrosis).</p><p>The medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies that lead to an initial diagnosis of SSc provide much of the information necessary to determine the distribution of organ involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Functional tests, additional imaging studies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> organ biopsy may be necessary to determine the distribution, severity, and nature of scleroderma-related processes prior to developing a treatment plan. For each potentially affected organ, particular tests are often recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9866624\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the wide spectrum of disease manifestations and organ involvement, the management of the disease is tailored to the individual patient, taking into account the disease subset and type of internal organ involvement.</p><p>In general, patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) are treated with organ-based symptomatic therapy. As examples, patients with gastrointestinal reflux are treated with proton-pump inhibitors, patients with Raynaud phenomenon are frequently treated with calcium channel blockers, and patients with hypertensive scleroderma renal crisis are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Organ-based treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>However, patients with diffuse skin involvement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe inflammatory organ involvement are usually treated more aggressively with systemic immunosuppressive therapy because of the increased risk of complications and organ failure. This includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with diffuse skin involvement that is severe or progressive</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with interstitial lung disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with myocarditis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe inflammatory myopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arthritis</p><p/><p>The aim of immunosuppressive therapy is to reduce progression or severity of SSc complications. Treatment should be started as early as possible in the disease course to slow disease progression before further damage occurs. Patients identified as having severe or rapidly progressive disease early on should be evaluated and managed in specialized centers with expertise for SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Such patients may be candidates for investigational therapies such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, possibly in the context of clinical trials (<a href=\"https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX//H/lCKGrzlGu03gYcMJXuTK3xOgZRWSwuWtJJ1t4oE0BLDg9oAHmh&amp;TOPIC_ID=7542\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">clinicaltrials.gov</a>). Various immunosuppressive and antifibrotic drugs, as well as investigational therapies, for the treatment of SSc are presented separately.

Unfortunately, most of these treatments demonstrate only a modest benefit, at best, for skin thickening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>For patients with progressive and diffuse skin involvement who do not have visceral involvement, we use either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF), and ideally initiate therapy within three years of disease onset. The choice to use either MTX or MMF is often guided by the presence of other disease manifestations, since there is no evidence that one medication is more efficacious than the other. Some clinicians prefer MTX for patients who also have arthritis or myositis, while others use MMF for patients with significant interstitial lung disease. We generally reserve the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> for progressive skin involvement in patients who are refractory to treatment with either MTX or MMF, or have severe rapidly progressive skin thickening.</p><p>The efficacy of MTX for the treatment of skin disease in patients with diffuse and progressive skin disease has been evaluated in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Both trials demonstrated an improvement in clinician-assessed skin thickening (the modified Rodnan skin score [mRSS]), although neither result was statistically significant. Consistent with an earlier study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], another large observational cohort study including 326 patients with early dcSSc (within three years of onset) compared the efficacy of four treatment protocols (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, MMF, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and no immunosuppression) and found a modest improvement in the mRSS across all groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. While there was no significant difference between protocols, there was a trend in favor of the protocols with immunosuppression. Based upon these trials as well as observational data, The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) endorses the use of MTX for progressive skin involvement in the early stages of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, there is no evidence that MTX is effective for visceral organ involvement.</p><p>The benefits of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> for the improvement of skin sclerosis are based upon small observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. A prospective study including 15 patients with dcSSc found that those who were administered mycophenolate for at least three months demonstrated significant improvement in the mRSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Another small prospective study with 25 previously untreated patients with dcSSc of recent onset (less than 24 months) also demonstrated improvement of skin involvement after an average of 18 months of therapy with MMF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Skin biopsies from three of the patients demonstrated histopathological improvement. A larger retrospective analysis of 98 patients with dcSSc treated with mycophenolate found improved mRSS compared with baseline within three months of starting treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The improved skin score in dcSSc patients treated with mycophenolate persisted during the 12 months of follow-up when compared with historical controls.

A large multicenter, randomized trial evaluated the efficacy of cyclophosphamide in early active alveolitis in 158 patients with SSc-associated interstitial lung disease. At one-year follow-up, cyclophosphamide therapy improved both lung function and skin scores compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H9866586\" class=\"local\">'Overview of pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of the initial pretreatment assessment is to determine the distribution of organ involvement and, if possible, to decide whether organ dysfunction is related to potentially reversible inflammation or vasoconstriction (active disease) or whether the damage is irreversible with available therapies (eg, fibrosis or ischemic necrosis). (See <a href=\"#H9866617\" class=\"local\">'Assessing disease severity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Due to the wide spectrum of disease manifestations and organ involvement, the management of the disease is tailored to the individual patient, taking into account the disease subset and type of internal organ involvement. In general, patients with SSc are treated with organ-based symptomatic therapy. However, patients with diffuse skin involvement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe inflammatory organ involvement are usually treated with systemic immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H9866624\" class=\"local\">'General principles of management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Organ-based treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aim of immunosuppressive therapy is to reduce progression or severity of SSc complications. Treatment should be started as early as possible in the disease course to slow disease progression before further damage occurs. Patients with diffuse skin involvement are more likely to require aggressive therapy because of the increased risk of developing complications. (See <a href=\"#H9866624\" class=\"local\">'General principles of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients require screening at routine intervals for the development of major organ complications, particularly cardiac disease, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and renal involvement. (See <a href=\"#H9866624\" class=\"local\">'General principles of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific organ-based treatments include that for skin, Raynaud phenomenon, renal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, cardiac, and genitourinary manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Organ-based treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a substantial increase in the risk of death in patients with SSc. Most deaths among patients with SSc are related to pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, or cardiac causes. Other significant causes of death include renal disease, malignancy, gastrointestinal, and infectious causes. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various risk factors have been associated with increased mortality, including the presence of extensive skin involvement, cardiac <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary involvement, renal disease, and the presence of anti-topoisomerase I antibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Th/To</span> antibodies. Male sex and younger age at disease onset may also be associated with increased mortality. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for increased mortality'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Denton CP, Hughes M, Gak N, et al.
