Macrominerals are defined as minerals that are required by adults in amounts greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or make up less than 1 percent of total body weight. Trace elements (or trace minerals) are usually defined as minerals that are required in amounts between 1 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> by adults or make up less than 0.01 percent of total body weight. Ultra-trace minerals generally are defined as minerals that are required in amounts less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Although the classification of mineral may be controversial and somewhat arbitrary, one outline is given in Table 1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73583 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic review will discuss the physiological and biochemical functions, dietary requirements, and signs and symptoms of excess and deficiency for the essential trace minerals, including iron, zinc, copper, manganese, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoride</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a>. Iodine (an ultra-trace mineral) will also be discussed because of its global importance in iodine deficiency. Several of these minerals are considered in more depth elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-deficiency-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine deficiency disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zinc deficiency and supplementation in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several systems have been used to describe nutritional requirements of a population. Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) were developed by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine to guide nutrient intake in a variety of settings. Under this system, requirements can be expressed as a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), which is defined as the dietary intake that is sufficient to meet the daily nutrient requirements of 97 percent of the individuals in a specific life stage group. If there is insufficient data to determine an RDA for a given nutrient, requirements can be expressed as an Adequate Intake (AI), which is an estimation of the nutrient intake necessary to maintain a healthy state. The upper limit (UL) is the maximum daily intake of a nutrient that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects. Intake of nutrients far in excess of the RDA is considered to be &quot;pharmacologic&quot; dosing. Dietary guidelines, which incorporate the RDAs, are periodically updated as new information arises.</p><p>The United States Department of Agriculture uses different nomenclature and age groupings, setting &quot;Daily Values&quot; to describe recommended intake for adults and children older than four years of age. What appears on food labels is the estimation of the amount of a nutrient provided based upon a 2000 calorie diet. Updated information can be found at the website of the Food and Nutrition Information Center of the United States Department of Agriculture (<a href=\"http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/index.html&amp;token=0kQT3eXJw+rNOP0+8f9imeGjfxXNfggjKwaw8QJc1WZUVQYa7r5PcYdo50+BdiJn&amp;TOPIC_ID=2585\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/index.html</a>).</p><p>These terms are described in greater detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary history and recommended dietary intake in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CHROMIUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1957, a compound extracted from pork kidney was termed &quot;glucose tolerance factor&quot; because it corrected hyperglycemia in rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Glucose tolerance factor was ultimately found to be chromium (Cr).</p><p>Chromium is a transition element and exists in multiple ionic states. Dietary chromium is in the trivalent state. The more oxidized form Cr4+ is a toxic and hazardous substance. Chromium occurs as a component of a metalloenzymes and functions as a coenzyme in various metabolic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary sources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chromium is found in various food products, including grains, cereals, fruits, vegetables, and processed meats, which have a higher Cr content than unprocessed meats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chromium is absorbed predominantly in the small intestine and is transported in the circulation bound to albumin and transferrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The total body Cr concentration is the main homeostatic control of its gut absorption. Dietary bioavailability of chromium is very low and almost all of the ingested chromium is excreted via feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Urinary and biliary excretion are alternative yet limited routes for its metabolism.</p><p>Other minerals influence absorption and cellular uptake of chromium. There is enhanced absorption of chromium in the setting of zinc and iron deficiency, suggesting that these minerals compete for intestinal absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other factors that interfere with chromium absorption include certain drugs such as antacids, which contain magnesium, calcium, or aluminum salts. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs that inhibit the production of prostaglandins also reduce chromium absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Chromium can be reduced by gastric acid to form insoluble salts that can precipitate and block its absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Administration of vitamin C enhances the uptake of chromium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chromium deficiency is generally limited to hospitalized patients with increased catabolism and metabolic demands in the setting of malnutrition. Some of the first case reports of chromium deficiency were from patients receiving parenteral nutrition. In diabetic patients receiving chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>, human chromium deficiency has been associated with increased insulin requirements. Chromium supplementation in these patients improved glucose tolerance and respiratory quotient, which indicates a preference for fat metabolism and reduced utilization of carbohydrates as an energy source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Other patients at risk for chromium deficiency include patients with short bowel syndrome, burns, traumatic injuries, or those on parenteral nutrition without appropriate trace mineral supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>An association has been suggested between low chromium levels and impaired glucose tolerance and unfavorable lipid profiles, but there is no evidence of chromium deficiency in patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Randomized trials on chromium supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes are of fair quality and meta-analyses reach conflicting conclusions about whether supplementation improves glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].</p><p>There is little evidence to support chromium supplementation in individuals without chromium deficiency. A popular interest has developed in chromium supplementation as a method for improving lean body mass and muscle building. However, multiple studies have shown no clinically important changes in lean body mass, total body fat, or weight loss as a result of chromium supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no reports of adverse effects of dietary chromium (trivalent chromium). Animal studies suggest that high doses of chromium are nontoxic, because of poor oral bioavailability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, airborne hexavalent chromium (VI) toxicity has been established as a work-related etiology of lung cancer in stainless steel workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Pentavalent (chromium V) and hexavalent chromium (chromium VI), which are not usually found in the diet, are toxic and carcinogenic by the inhalation route of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Industrial exposure to chromium (V and VI) can result in toxicity manifested as contact dermatitis, skin ulcers, and bronchogenic cancers. Tannery workers handling wet hides may develop chromium toxicity with elevated serum and urinary chromium levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary reference intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adequate intake of chromium for adults is 20 to 35 mcg per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51953 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">COPPER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two heritable diseases are caused by inborn errors of copper metabolism: Wilson's disease is a disorder of copper excretion and is characterized by signs and symptoms of copper toxicity, whereas Menkes disease is a genetic disorder of copper uptake from the intestine and is characterized by signs and symptoms of copper deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Menkes disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary sources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The variability in the copper content of food reflects the variability in the copper content of soil. Further variability is introduced by variations in manufacturing methods.</p><p>In the Western diet, approximately 60 percent of dietary copper comes from vegetable products, with vegetables, grains, and pulses (leguminous seeds such as beans, peas, and lentils) each providing approximately 20 percent. A further 20 percent comes from meat, fish, and poultry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The highest content of copper is found in liver (20 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> versus 1 to 2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in white bread and 0.02 to 0.08 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in cow's milk). According to the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey, the average daily dietary copper intake for adults in the United States is 1 to 1.6 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Copper is found in high concentrations in liver, brain, and to a lesser degree, in kidney, heart, and pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The total copper content in the adult human body is estimated to be 50 to 120 mg. The newborn term infant contains approximately 12 mg copper. Breast milk contains relatively little copper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Early in lactation breast milk contains up to 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> copper but this rapidly falls to 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> and may provide less than the recommended copper intake by the WHO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. During this period, any shortfall in copper intake can be met by mobilizing liver copper stores.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Copper is absorbed in the proximal small intestine and stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The acidic environment in the stomach facilitates solubilization of copper by dissociating it from copper containing dietary macromolecules. Absorption occurs by a saturable active transport process at lower levels of dietary copper and by passive diffusion at high levels of dietary copper. The Menkes P-type ATPase (ATP7A) is responsible for copper trafficking to the secretory pathway for efflux from enterocytes and other cells. Absorbed copper is loosely bound to plasma albumin and amino acids in the portal blood and taken to the liver where most of it is taken up on the first pass. </p><p>In the liver, the copper is incorporated into the copper-containing protein ceruloplasmin, which serves to transport copper from the liver to peripheral tissues. Ceruloplasmin binds to its receptors on the cell surface; copper is then released from its binding protein and enters the cell. Ceruloplasmin has an independent role in iron metabolism, in which it serves as a plasma ferroxidase, converting iron to a valence that can be bound by plasma transferrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Metallothionein, synthesized in the liver, may act as a copper storage protein.</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of copper is excreted in the bile while the remaining half is excreted through other gastrointestinal secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. This excretion of copper into the gastrointestinal tract is the major pathway that regulates copper homeostasis and prevents deficiency or toxicity. The Wilson P-type ATPase (ATP7B) is responsible for copper trafficking to the secretory pathway for ceruloplasmin biosynthesis and for endosome formation prior to biliary secretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Biological role</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of important copper-containing enzymes have been described, including the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zinc-copper superoxide dismutase (antioxidant defense); dopamine mono-oxygenase (neurotransmitter synthesis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lysyl oxidase (collagen cross-linking, bone formation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ceruloplasmin (copper transporter and ferroxidase)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytochrome c oxidase (electron transport)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor V (thrombosis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tyrosinase (melanin production)</p><p/><p>These cupro-enzymes help to explain some of the clinical features of severe copper deficiency, including lack of skin pigmentation (decreased dopamine beta-hydrolase), weakness (decreased cytochrome c), and bleeding disorders (decreased factor V).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Deficiency</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Copper deficiency is characterized clinically by fragile, abnormally-formed hair, depigmentation of the skin, muscle weakness (myeloneuropathy), neurological abnormalities, edema, and hepatosplenomegaly, and osteoporosis. The neurologic manifestations include ataxia, neuropathy, and cognitive deficits that can mimic vitamin B12 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

Because the anemia is microcytic and hypochromic, it can be mistaken for the anemia of iron deficiency. If iron supplements are given, these can worsen copper deficiency because excess iron competes with copper and decreases net copper absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Thrombocytopenia also may occur but is relatively rare.

This is the most common cause of acquired copper deficiency and likely to become even more prominent as the rates of bariatric surgery increase. Typically, neurologic manifestations are delayed by years following gastric surgery.

Because copper and zinc are competitively absorbed from the jejunum via metallothionein, high doses of zinc can result in copper deficiency in normal individuals, particularly if combined with other risk factors such as gastric surgery. Excessive zinc has been ingested due to prolonged use of zinc supplements (eg, for common colds, acrodermatitis enteropathica, or other conditions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/38,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,54</a>], ingestion of denture cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>], or from swallowing zinc-containing coins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Trace elements in TPN are sometimes withheld in the setting of cholestasis, and resulting copper deficiency in this setting has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Menkes disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Menkes disease, also known as Menkes kinky hair syndrome, is a congenital x-linked genetic disorder with an incidence of about 1:100,000 live births. It is caused by a mutation of the transport protein mediating copper uptake from the intestine, encoded by the ATP7A gene. Inactivating mutations in this gene result in severe copper deficiency with progressive neurologic deterioration and death during early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].

Typically, non-heme iron is found in vegetables and fruit, as well as iron-fortified food products. Absorption of non-heme iron increases as iron status declines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Iron-fortified foods have become increasingly common in the Western diet, such that American children now consume more iron from cereal or breads than from beef or chicken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

A previous outbreak of selenium poisoning occurred in 13 individuals who took a mislabeled supplement in 1983 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary reference intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a> is available from seafoods, organ meats, and plant foods. Plant Se content depends upon soil Se concentrations. The RDA for selenium is 20 mcg daily for young children, rising to 55 mcg daily for adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51953 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58\"><span class=\"h1\">ZINC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zinc has been recognized as a distinct element since 1509, but was not identified as an essential mineral until the 1900s. In 1961, a link was established between zinc deficiency, endemic hypogonadism, and dwarfism in rural Iran [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/155-157\" class=\"abstract_t\">155-157</a>].</p><p>In more recent years much interest has been generated by the possibility that subclinical zinc deficiency may significantly increase the incidence of and morbidity and mortality from diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infections. Along with iron, iodine, and vitamin A, zinc deficiency is one of the most important micronutrient deficiencies globally. Several studies have now demonstrated that supplementation of high risk populations can have substantial health benefits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zinc deficiency and supplementation in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary sources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meat and chicken are excellent sources of zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>], as are nuts and lentils. In the Western diet, food products such as breakfast cereal are fortified with zinc and these products provide an increasingly important source of zinc. Approximately 45 percent of adults may have inadequate zinc intakes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total body zinc averages 1.5 to 2.5 g in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>], similar to that of iron. A large proportion (60 percent) of total body zinc is in bone and muscle pools with slow turnover. Zinc is actively absorbed throughout the small intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/160,161\" class=\"abstract_t\">160,161</a>]. Typically, zinc absorption is 20 to 40 percent efficient, and may be related to zinc status.</p><p>Zinc is absorbed mainly in the duodenum and jejunum, and to a lesser extent in the ileum and large intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/161,162\" class=\"abstract_t\">161,162</a>]. During digestion, dietary zinc is released and forms complexes with different ligands, namely amino acids, phosphates, organic acids, and histidines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>]. Zinc-ligand complexes are then absorbed through the intestinal mucosa by both an active and passive process. Once absorbed, the portal circulation carries zinc to the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>].</p><p>There is an intricate homeostatic control of zinc absorption, regulated by metallothionein, a metalloprotein that binds copper and other divalent cations. Metallothionein in the gut enterocyte is more avid for copper than zinc. This is advantageous for the treatment of Wilson's disease since regular intake of zinc will competitively block gut copper uptake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Zinc absorption may be impaired in pancreatic disease or insufficiency. Pancreatic enzymes are necessary for release of dietary zinc, and pancreatic juices may contain zinc-complexing ligands. Phytic acid is known to reduce zinc absorption. Zinc shares some common absorptive components with iron and copper, and the three minerals may compete for absorption. Zinc is transported bound to albumin. It is taken up by peripheral tissues and by the liver where it may be stored as metallothionein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>].</p><p>The major route of zinc excretion is via the gastrointestinal tract. Up to 10 percent of the circulating zinc is also excreted through urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]. Zinc homeostasis is probably maintained by a combination of changes in fractional absorption and endogenous fecal zinc excretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61\"><span class=\"h2\">Biological role</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zinc owes its biological role to the ability to form tight bonds with certain amino acids, especially histidine and cysteine. When zinc binds four amino acids (tetradentate configuration), it serves a structural role maintaining protein structure (such as the beta-pleated sheet), and maintains nuclear stability and histone structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>]. It is in this form that zinc contributes to zinc finger proteins that interact with DNA. When zinc binds three amino acids, the fourth site is temporarily taken by a water molecule; in this form, zinc can play a role in the metabolic activity of many proteins.</p><p>Approximately 250 proteins contain zinc. These include enzymes such as angiotensin converting enzyme, alkaline phosphatase, carbonic anhydrase, DNA and RNA polymerases, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, and metallothionein, as well as a large family of zinc proteins involved in gene transcription (such as the zinc finger proteins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/166,167\" class=\"abstract_t\">166,167</a>]. Zinc has important roles both in cell division as well as apoptosis (programmed cell death).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62\"><span class=\"h2\">Deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild dietary zinc deficiency impairs growth velocity while severe depletion of zinc leads to growth retardation. Other clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency include delayed sexual maturation, impotence, hypogonadism, oligospermia, alopecia, dysgeusia (impaired taste), immune dysfunction, night blindness, impaired wound healing, and various skin lesions. The dermatologic changes occur primarily in the extremities or around body orifices and are often characterized by erythematous, vesiculobullous, and pustular lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59027 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. Other signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency include loss of taste, change in hair color, and easy pluckability of hair. Also seen but not specific are night blindness, impaired appetite, delayed wound healing, decubitus ulcers, and decreased sperm counts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zinc deficiency and supplementation in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Findings such as these, suggesting zinc deficiency, have been described in chronic diseases such as malnutrition, malabsorption syndromes (such as chronic inflammatory bowel disease), prolonged breastfeeding, and following necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. Reduced zinc absorption and stores, and occasional cases of symptomatic zinc deficiency have been demonstrated in patients who have undergone gastric bypass for obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/169,170\" class=\"abstract_t\">169,170</a>]. Pregnancy also increases the risk for zinc deficiency. Alcoholic cirrhotic patients often have low hepatic concentrations of zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/171\" class=\"abstract_t\">171</a>]. Cases of zinc deficiency have been reported among elderly individuals with poor diet quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/172\" class=\"abstract_t\">172</a>]. In these cases, the dietary zinc deficiency may have been exacerbated by medications that increase urinary losses of zinc, including thiazides, loop diuretics, and angiotensin receptor blockers.</p><p>Zinc deficiency can be seen in patients receiving chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) solutions lacking adequate zinc supplementation, or chronic TPN use with an underlying condition causing zinc losses, such as diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, or other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>].</p><p>Diabetics also have some alterations of zinc metabolism. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetics can exhibit hyperzincuria, which may have a role in the immune dysfunction associated with diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/174\" class=\"abstract_t\">174</a>]. Zinc supplementation in diabetic patients may improve immune function, but also increases the HbA1c levels and leads to worsening glucose intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/175\" class=\"abstract_t\">175</a>].</p><p>Mild zinc deficiency appears to be common, especially in developing countries. Individuals in developing countries are at risk of zinc deficiency because the diet is relatively low in zinc and contain significant amounts of phytates (which reduce zinc absorption). There is some evidence supporting the role of zinc supplementation to increase growth velocity in children, and several studies have suggested a benefit of zinc supplementation in children with acute diarrhea in developing countries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zinc deficiency and supplementation in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Zinc supplementation during pregnancy for women with mild zinc deficiency appears to promote fetal growth and reduce the risk of premature birth and infant diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/81,176-178\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,176-178</a>]. Zinc has also been used to treat the common cold, but probably has little clinical value. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63\"><span class=\"h3\">Acrodermatitis enteropathica</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) is an autosomal recessive disease in which zinc absorption is impaired. The disorder is caused by mutations in the SLC39A4 gene on chromosome 8q24.3, which encodes a protein that appears to be involved in zinc transportation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/179,180\" class=\"abstract_t\">179,180</a>].</p><p>AE is characterized by signs and symptoms of severe zinc deficiency, including diarrhea, dermatitis (especially perioral and perianal), alopecia, poor growth, and poor immune function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]. The dermatitis consists of hyperpigmented skin lesions on the acral surfaces of the upper and the lower extremities, as well as the face and buttocks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71329\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71329 \">picture 2</a>). Symptoms usually appear in early infancy, once breast-feeding is completely discontinued. Systemic signs include intestinal disturbances, growth failure, irritability, and lethargy. Thymic hypoplasia has also been described in association with AE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>].</p><p>Oral supplementation with zinc (30 to 45 mg per day) leads to a rapid and complete remission of the symptoms. Therapy needs to be continued indefinitely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans are very tolerant of high zinc intakes up to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/181\" class=\"abstract_t\">181</a>]. Mega-dose supplementation or high zinc intake from contaminated food or beverages has been associated with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/158,160,182\" class=\"abstract_t\">158,160,182</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Copper'</a> above.)</p><p>Treatment for zinc toxicity is primarily supportive, although chelation with calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (CaNa2EDTA) has been used in some cases of severe toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of zinc status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma levels of zinc do not necessarily correlate with tissue levels and do not reliably identify individuals with zinc deficiency. Although plasma levels are generally a good index of zinc status in healthy individuals, these levels are depressed during inflammatory disease states. Erythrocyte concentrations of zinc may provide a more useful measure of zinc status during acute or chronic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/184\" class=\"abstract_t\">184</a>]. Several functional indices also can be used to indirectly assess zinc status. Serum superoxide dismutase and erythrocyte alkaline phosphatase activities have been proposed as indirect markers of zinc status, but these tests are not widely available.</p><p>Because most zinc is bound to albumin, measured zinc levels may be reduced in patients with hypoalbuminemia. However, in clinical practice, it is not particularly helpful to correct measured zinc levels for hypoalbuminemia, because the correlation between zinc and albumin levels is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/185\" class=\"abstract_t\">185</a>] and plasma levels are loosely correlated with zinc stores. Moreover, zinc replacement is usually indicated for patients with low zinc levels, regardless of albumin status, depending upon the clinical context.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary reference intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine and the World Health Organization (WHO) have published standard recommendations for daily zinc intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals/abstract/23,186\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,186</a>].
