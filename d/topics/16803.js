If your cut is wide, jagged, or does go all the way through the skin, you will most likely need stitches. If you are unsure if your cut needs stitches, check with your doctor or nurse.</p><p>This article discusses cuts and scrapes that do not need stitches. Stitches are discussed in a separate article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stitches-and-staples-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Stitches and staples (The Basics)&quot;</a>.).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11043545\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I take care of a cut or scrape on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To take care of your cut or scrape, follow these basic first aid guidelines:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean the cut or scrape &ndash; Wash it well with soap and water. If there is dirt, glass, or another object in your cut that you can't get out after you wash it, call your doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop the bleeding &ndash; If your cut or scrape is bleeding, press a clean cloth or bandage firmly on the area for 20 minutes. You can also help slow the bleeding by holding the cut above the level of your heart. If the bleeding doesn't stop after 20 minutes, call your doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a thin layer of antibiotic ointment on the cut or scrape.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cover the cut or scrape with a bandage or gauze. Keep the bandage clean and dry. Change the bandage 1 to 2 times every day until your cut or scrape heals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watch for signs that your cut or scrape is infected.</p><p/><p>Most cuts and scrapes heal on their own within 7 to 10 days. As your cut or scrape heals, a scab will form. Be sure to leave the scab alone and not pick at it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11043560\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call the doctor or nurse if you have any signs of an infection. Signs of an infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness, swelling, warmth, or increased pain around the cut or scrape</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pus draining from the cut or scrape</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red streaks on the skin around the cut or scrape</p><p/><p>Cuts called &quot;puncture wounds&quot; have a higher chance of getting infected. A puncture wound is a type of cut that is made when a sharp object goes through the skin and into the tissue underneath.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11043575\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need a tetanus shot?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. It depends on how old you are and when your last tetanus shot was. Tetanus is a serious infection that can cause muscle stiffness and spasms, and even lead to death. It is caused by bacteria (germs) that live in the dirt.</p><p>Most children get a tetanus vaccine as part of their routine check-ups. Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections. Many adults also get a tetanus vaccine as part of their routine check-ups. Getting all your vaccines is important, since it's possible to get tetanus even from a small cut or scrape.</p><p>If your skin is cut, and especially if the cut is dirty or deep, ask your doctor or nurse if you need a tetanus shot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11043590\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stitches-and-staples-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stitches and staples (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-care-of-bruises-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking care of bruises (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=animal-and-human-bites-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Animal and human bites (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=animal-and-human-bites-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Animal and human bites (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
