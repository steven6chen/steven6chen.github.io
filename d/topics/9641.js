In addition, as noted above, epidemiologic studies of AKI do not reliably identify the etiology.</p><p>In a meta-analysis that included 143 studies and &gt;3.5 million patients, among hospitalized patients, the global incidence of AKI, as defined according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, was estimated to be 22 percent, the equivalent of one in five hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The KDIGO definition of AKI is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging criteria of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, a more recent cross-sectional study of 97 intensive care units (ICUs) from 33 countries and based on data from 1802 patients during their first week of ICU admission showed a much higher AKI burden. Fifty-seven and three-tenths (57.3) percent of enrolled patients fulfilled the KDIGO criteria for AKI (95% CI 55.0-59.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The incidence of AKI appears to be increasing in the United States. One study, for example, evaluated the incidence of AKI using the 1988 to 2002 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a United States-based administrative database containing a representative sample of discharges from acute care, nonfederal hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The incidence of AKI rose from 61 per 100,000 population in 1988 to 288 per 100,000 population in 2002. For AKI requiring dialysis, the percentage of annual discharges increased from 0.03 percent in 1988 to 0.2 percent in 2002, translating to an increase in the incidence rate from 4 per 100,000 population in 1988 to 27 per 100,000 population in 2002. A more recent study, also using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, reported an increase in the incidence rate of dialysis-requiring AKI from 222 to 533 cases per million person-years, averaging a 10 percent increase per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In an attempt to better assess the population-based incidence of AKI using laboratory data, several studies identified all patients with changes in serum creatinine concentrations in particular databases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report identified all patients with increased serum creatinine concentrations (150 and 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> [1.7 and 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL]</span> for men and women, respectively) in a six-month period in 2003 among a geographic population of 523,390 individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The incidence of AKI and acute superimposed on chronic kidney disease (CKD) was 1811 and 336 per million population, respectively. Unlike other studies, this report included all patients from a defined geographic area, independent of the need for dialysis and independent of location of treatment. Inclusion of patients with milder forms of AKI or prerenal dysfunction and participation of all patient care facilities in one region may have resulted in the relatively higher annual incidence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study identified all patients with significant increases in serum creatinine values (defined in part by baseline kidney function) who were enrolled in a large, integrated health care system in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Between the years 1996 to 2003, there was an increased incidence of AKI not requiring dialysis from 323 to 522 per 100,000 person-years and of AKI requiring dialysis from 20 to 30 per 100,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>The epidemiology of and risk factors for AKI occurring after coronary artery bypass graft surgery are discussed separately.

However, the duration of AKI is variable, depending upon the length and severity of the initial ischemic episode; whether or not recurrent ischemia occurs or nephrotoxic therapy is continued; and, perhaps, whether the patient is oliguric or nonoliguric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Some patients recover within days, while others require dialysis for many months.

Although clinical evidence of AKI is often present postoperatively (low glomerular filtration rate [GFR], elevated fractional excretion of sodium), kidney function usually returns to baseline within one to three days since the duration of ischemia is short lived (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67443 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>].</p><p>Although its pathophysiology differs from that of ischemic AKI, the limited duration of the insult may also explain in part the typical three- to five-day course of contrast-induced AKI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two mechanisms have been proposed for the short duration of renal dysfunction: mild AKI or postischemic tubular dysfunction, in which the tubular cells remain morphologically normal. This phenomenon, which is similar to postischemic dysfunction in the &quot;stunned&quot; myocardium, may be at least in part due to redistribution of membrane transport proteins.</p><p>Tubular sodium reabsorption occurs via entry into the cells across the luminal membrane and then active transport out of the cells by the Na-K-ATPase pump in the basolateral membrane. Following renal ischemia in animal models, the actin cytoskeleton that anchors the Na-K-ATPase pump to the basolateral membrane becomes disrupted, resulting in partial redistribution of the pumps onto the luminal membrane, thereby interfering with normal ion transport by pumping sodium back into the tubular lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Recovery of function is associated with recovery of normal polarity, in which the Na-K-ATPase pumps are again limited to the basolateral membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Prolonged acute kidney injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional recovery may be markedly delayed in patients with persistent septic physiology and circulatory shock or who have repeated episodes of renal ischemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> repeated exposure to endogenous or exogenous nephrotoxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>]. In these settings, tubular cell apoptosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrosis have occurred, and the regeneration of tubular cells that is required for the restoration of renal function may be delayed or completely abolished.</p><p>Hemodynamic autoregulation in kidneys with AKI is altered, creating an environment that is particularly sensitive to diminished perfusion. Normal kidneys vasodilate in the presence of ischemia as part of the normal autoregulatory response to maintain renal blood flow near the baseline level. This response is impaired in AKI, perhaps because vascular endothelial injury reduces the release of vasodilating substances such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide (endothelium-derived relaxing factor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>As a result, recurrent episodes of hypotension, as with sepsis or renal replacement therapy (RRT), are more likely to lead to renewed tubular injury. RRT may also delay recovery of renal function by a second mechanism: neutrophil activation induced by the interaction of blood with less biocompatible dialyzer or hemofilter membranes.

A small, acute decrement in kidney function due to AKI may also increase in-hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Post-hospitalization mortality of patients with AKI is also increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/23,24,52,54,56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,52,54,56-59</a>]. The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, among 36,980 patients admitted to a Veterans Affairs (VA) facility between 1999 and 2005, compared with patients admitted with myocardial infarction (MI) alone, those admitted with AKI or AKI plus MI had a higher risk of death after discharge (hazard ratios [HRs] 1.85, 95% CI 1.76-1.94 and 2.14, 95% CI 2.05-2.23, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large meta-analysis of 110 studies (429,535 patients) that utilized the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition of AKI, AKI-associated mortality was 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of over five million hospital discharges, death within 90 days after hospital discharge was 35 and 13 percent among patients with and without AKI, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The major causes of in-hospital mortality in patients with AKI are infection and the underlying disease (such as hypotension following open-heart surgery), not necessarily kidney failure itself. Patients at risk are generally very ill, with evidence of multiple organ dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longer-term mortality among patients with AKI may also be increased, as demonstrated in a study of 843 patients who underwent cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Eight years after hospital discharge, mortality was significantly higher in patients with postoperative AKI (defined as at least a 25 percent elevation in serum creatinine in the first postoperative week) compared with those who did not have AKI (36 versus 22 percent; adjusted HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15-2.32). The increase in risk was independent of whether or not kidney function had recovered at the time of hospital discharge. However, the increase in late mortality did not begin until more than four to five years after surgery, raising a question about the relationship to postoperative AKI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early noncardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;, section on 'Acute kidney injury'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a systematic review of 47,017 patients that examined the long-term morbidity and mortality risk among survivors of AKI, the incidence rate of mortality was 8.9 deaths per 100 person-years in survivors of AKI and 4.3 deaths per 100 patient-years in survivors without AKI (rate ratio [RR] 2.59, 95% CI 1.97-3.42) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. AKI was also associated with development of MI. The incidence rate of chronic kidney disease (CKD) after an episode of AKI was 7.8 events per 100 patient-years, and the rate of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was 4.9 events per 100 patient-years. Unfortunately, the relative risk of development of CKD after episodes of AKI was not determined, because of lack of follow-up of control subjects who did not have AKI. The majority of patients who sustain an episode of AKI are not followed by nephrologists after discharge from the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. This is confirmed by a survey of 598 US nephrologists who stated that only 9 percent of outpatient clinic visits were for follow-up of AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors influencing mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An understanding of the clinical characteristics that appear to most strongly affect mortality among patients with AKI may help direct supportive care to those most likely to benefit. A variety of factors have been associated with increased mortality, including male sex, race, older age, oliguria, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, overall severity of illness, and quality of life after recovery from AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/59,62-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,62-68</a>]. A multicenter, prospective cohort study evaluated the natural history and predictors of mortality in 618 critically ill patients with AKI, 64 percent of whom required renal replacement therapy (RRT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the following characteristics were predictive of mortality at 60 days:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.13 per decade)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis (OR 1.50)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult respiratory distress syndrome (OR 1.79)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver failure (OR 1.62)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombocytopenia (OR 1.66)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood urea nitrogen (BUN; OR 1.09 per 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum creatinine &lt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (OR 1.99 [177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span></p><p/><p>The underlying importance of the overall severity of illness in determining survival among patients with AKI was supported by the findings of a multicenter, prospective, controlled trial of 153 patients with AKI requiring RRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Illness severity within 24 hours of the initiation of RRT, as determined by the Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scoring system, predicted survival and recovery of kidney function. Other observational studies also showed an association of the APACHE II and other severity of illness scores with hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/34,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,70</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predictive scoring systems in the intensive care unit&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute pancreatitis represents a good example of the relation between multiple organ dysfunction and patient survival in AKI. A report of 267 patients with acute pancreatitis noted a 16 percent incidence of AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Kidney failure tended to occur relatively late in the course, usually in the setting of multiple organ failure. The mortality rate in these patients was 81 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, the prognosis is usually excellent in patients who are otherwise healthy, as with AKI following a transfusion reaction, the administration of a nephrotoxic drug, or ischemia in which perfusion has been restored. This was illustrated by the results among patients enrolled in the placebo arm of a multicenter, randomized trial; the mortality rate was 10 versus 30 percent among patients with nephrotoxic versus ischemic ATN, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Pre-existing poor nutritional status may enhance mortality in AKI. In a prospective study of 309 patients with AKI, a significantly higher proportion of patients with severe malnutrition died compared with those with a normal nutritional status (62 versus 13 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Similar findings were noted in a second series, in which both hypoalbuminemia and hypocholesterolemia, each assumed to reflect poor nutritional status, were associated with a significantly increased risk of death among patients with AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Race may also influence the effect of AKI on in-hospital mortality. One study of approximately 400,000 patients with AKI found a significantly lower in-house mortality among black patients compared with white patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. This was observed for almost all diagnoses and procedures. As an example, a significantly lower mortality rate was noted among black patients with AKI post-coronary artery bypass surgery (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.87). The reasons underlying this observation are not clear.</p><p>Health-related quality of life may predict mortality among survivors of AKI. This was suggested by a multivariate analysis of 429 AKI survivors who were identified from a randomized, multicenter study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. A low health-related quality of life, assessed at day 60 using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), was associated with a higher mortality at one year compared with higher scores. Four prespecified HUI3 attributes, including higher ambulation, emotion, cognition, and subscale pain scores, were associated with better survival. Other variables that were associated with an increased risk of death in this study included older age, comorbid disease, and a longer length of initial hospital stay. Dialysis dependence at day 60 was not associated with increased mortality on the multivariate analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal replacement therapy factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RRT with a biocompatible membrane, as compared with a bioincompatible membrane, was considered to be associated with enhanced patient survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. However, a meta-analysis of nine studies with a total of 1062 patients with AKI requiring intermittent hemodialysis showed no significant difference between use of biocompatible and bioincompatible membranes for survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>A related issue is whether the particular dialysis modality that is utilized affects mortality.

This issue was addressed in a single-center survey of 9210 hospitalized adults who had two or more serum creatinine concentrations measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

In addition, even milder forms of AKI adversely affect long-term mortality. In a large, retrospective study of 864,933 US veteran patients with a mean follow-up time of 2.3 years, hospitalized patients surviving an episode of AKI for &gt;90 days after discharge from the hospital and not requiring dialysis experienced an adjusted long-term mortality risk of 1.41 (95% CI, 1.39-1.43) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>The possibility that nonoliguric AKI is associated with a more favorable prognosis relative to oliguric AKI is discussed separately.

Compared with matched controls, the incidence of cardiovascular events (defined as a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], coronary artery bypass graft, and coronary angiography) was higher among patients who developed AKI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.67, 95% CI 1.36-2.04). The increased cardiovascular risk appeared to be at least partly independent of subsequent progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD; although the strength of the association was stronger when progression to CKD was not accounted for) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. It is possible that the increased cardiovascular risk is mediated by an increase in hypertension.
