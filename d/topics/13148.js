During fetal life, the DA diverts blood from the pulmonary artery into the aorta, thereby bypassing the lungs. After birth, the DA undergoes active constriction and eventual obliteration. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs when the ductus fails to completely close after delivery.</p><p>PDA occurs commonly in premature infants, especially in those with respiratory distress syndrome. In very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight below 1500 g) the incidence of PDA is about 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of PDA in premature infants are reviewed here. The management of PDA in premature infants as well as the diagnosis and treatment of PDA in older infants and children are discussed separately.

As a result, the majority of the blood flow exiting from the right ventricle bypasses the pulmonary arteries in a right-to-left shunt across the ductus arteriosus (DA) into the descending aorta and on to the placenta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70458\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70458 \">algorithm 1</a>). In the fetus, because of the large right-to-left shunting of blood, the ductus is a large vessel with a diameter similar to that of the descending aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65828\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65828 \">figure 1</a>).

At the same time, systemic resistance rises with placental removal. These factors lead to a sudden reversal of blood flow in the DA from right-to-left to left-to-right shunting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10685794\"><span class=\"h2\">Patency of the ductus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ductus in the fetus is kept widely patent by low arterial oxygen content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In newborn lambs with no respiratory distress, PGE2 concentrations fall to maternal levels within a few hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; in contrast, newborn lambs with respiratory distress have PGE2 levels that are greater than fetal levels. The extent of ductal patency correlates with PGE2 values.</p><p>Glucocorticoids appear to change the sensitivity of the DA to PGE2. For example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> given to preterm lambs facilitates ductal constriction, perhaps by decreasing the sensitivity of the ductus to the dilating action of PGE2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This may explain the reduced incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants whose mothers received antenatal glucocorticoid treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In two case series, fetal echocardiography detected ductal constriction in approximately one-half of the fetuses whose mothers received antenatal indomethacin treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In one of these reports, ductal constriction occurred in 70 percent of fetuses after 31 weeks gestation and reversed with discontinuation of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In isolated rings of DA from premature fetal lambs, low oxygen caused ductal relaxation that was not affected by inhibitors of cyclooxygenase or by NO synthase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, higher oxygen tension resulted in ductal constriction that was further increased by inhibition of cyclooxygenase or NO synthase. The NO that is important in regulating ductal tone is synthesized by endothelial cells in the lumen and vasa vasorum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10685815\"><span class=\"h2\">Ductal constriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At birth, the rise in systemic oxygen tension with the onset of breathing results in active constriction of the ductus, although the mechanisms for this response are not fully understood. In addition, circulating levels of the vasodilator PGE2 are decreased after delivery because of both reduced production following removal of the placenta and increased pulmonary clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The predominance of constricting agents results in ductal constriction.

The closure is thought to begin at the pulmonary end of the ductus and proceed toward the aortic end [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Complete anatomic closure may take up to several months. Following initial functional constriction, the proliferation and infolding of endothelial cells, and migration of undifferentiated smooth muscle cells result in the obliteration of the ductal lumen and conversion to the ligamentum arteriosum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. These histologic changes depend upon the initial ductal constriction and the resultant hypoxia within the ductal wall. Hypoxia of the inner vessel wall causes loss of cells from the muscle media and production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF stimulates endothelial cell proliferation that leads to formation of mounds in the intima that occlude the lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p>Gestational age has a major impact upon the rate of ductal closure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10685829\"><span class=\"h3\">Term infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At term, constriction of the ductus results in functional hemodynamic closure in 50 percent of infants within 24 hours after birth, in 90 percent at 48 hours, and in virtually all patients after 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10685837\"><span class=\"h3\">Preterm infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ductal closure is delayed in preterm infants and the risk of PDA is inversely proportional to gestational age. Respiratory illness also is associated with PDA especially in infants less than 30 weeks gestation. The ductus is functionally closed by the fourth day in nearly all healthy infants greater than 30 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, in ill infants less than 30 weeks gestation, PDA persists on the fourth day in approximately 65 percent and closure is especially delayed for moderate to large PDAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Closure is less likely to occur in infants who have hyaline membrane disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who do not receive antenatal corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The higher incidence of PDA in preterm infants may be explained by the effect of prematurity on the regulators of ductal tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Oxygen has a less pronounced constrictor effect in very premature lamb fetuses compared with late preterm fetuses because of greater sensitivity to the dilating actions of PGE2 and NO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/9,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21</a>]. This was also shown in a baboon model that demonstrated that ductal tissue hypoxia in the term but not preterm fetus resulted in cell death, VEGF expression, endothelial proliferation, and intimal mound formation resulting in functional ductal closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These findings may be due to the much thinner premature DA that is able to extract its oxygen needs from the blood flow within its lumen. These results suggest that the degree of hypoxia resulting in a loss of the hypoxic signal for cell death and VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation is not the same in the very preterm infant compared with term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10685844\"><span class=\"h3\">Reopening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histological changes following constriction of the DA occur rapidly in term infants and prevent subsequent reopening.

In one study of 77 preterm infants who had complete clinical closure of a PDA after indomethacin treatment, a clinically significant PDA recurred in 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The rate of reopening was related to decreasing gestational age, occurring more frequently in infants less than 27 weeks gestation than in those 27 to 33 weeks (37 versus 11 percent). The reopening of the DA may be due to the same effects of prematurity that blunt the ductal response to factors that promote initial constriction at the time of delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10685851\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The shunting of blood through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants is essentially all left-to-right from the aorta into the pulmonary arteries. As a result, there is excessive flow through the pulmonary circulation and hypoperfusion of the systemic circulation.

Approximately 80 percent of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants with birth weight &lt;1000 g who have a murmur progress to large, persistent PDAs. The risk is lower in larger infants. In a few patients, asymptomatic PDA can persist with closure occurring after 10 days of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Clinical findings seen in the majority of preterm infants with a hemodynamically significant PDA include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Murmur &ndash; The murmur often is heard over the entire precordium, but best in the left infraclavicular region and upper left sternal border. Because of high pulmonary vascular resistance after birth, aortic pressure is greater than pulmonary pressure during systole, but may not be so during diastole. As a result, the murmur initially may be heard only in systole and have an ejection quality. As pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure fall, aortic pressure is higher than pulmonary artery pressure during both systole and diastole, producing continuous flow through the ductus and a continuous (machinery) murmur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104792\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104792 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Occasionally, a PDA is clinically &quot;silent&quot; with absence of a murmur, especially in the first three days after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].

However, it has not been possible to establish stringent echocardiographic criteria that directly correlate with end-organ hypoperfusion and clinical morbidity.</p><p>The size of the PDA measured by echocardiography is generally used to determine whether or not a PDA is hemodynamically significant in preterm infants. One commonly used measure is a transductal diameter that exceeds 1.5 mm or 1.4 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. In one series of mechanically ventilated infants younger than 30 weeks gestation, a ductal diameter of 1.5 mm or greater at 7 to 31 hours of life predicted a significant PDA with 83 percent sensitivity and 90 percent specificity for a PDA that was treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>However, the use of the transductal diameter as the sole measure of a significant PDA has been increasingly scrutinized, partly as trials utilizing this threshold have not resulted in a reduction of neonatal morbidity associated with PDA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. As an alternative, a proposed staging system to detect clinically significant PDA uses both clinical findings (eg, oxygenation index, degree of respiratory support, chest radiography, and end-organ function) and echocardiographic measurements to classify the severity of PDA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Others have used the PDA:left pulmonary artery (LPA) ratio to define large (&ge;1), moderate (&lt;1 but &ge;0.5), and small (&lt;0.5) PDAs in the first four days of postnatal life to predict which infants would receive treatment for PDA closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs when the ductus fails to completely close after delivery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the fetus, blood from the right ventricle passes away from the constricted pulmonary arteries, which have a high vascular resistance, and flows into the DA and descending aorta. With the onset of respiration after delivery, the lungs expand and the systemic oxygen saturation rises, resulting in pulmonary vasodilatation and a drop in pulmonary vascular resistance. At the same time, systemic resistance rises with the removal of the placenta. These factors lead to a sudden reversal of blood flow in the DA from right-to-left to left-to-right. (See <a href=\"#H10685787\" class=\"local\">'Fetal and transitional ductal circulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ductal closure is delayed in preterm infants and the risk of PDA is inversely proportional to gestational age.

(See <a href=\"#H10685837\" class=\"local\">'Preterm infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In infants with a PDA, the left-to-right shunting of blood results in an excessive blood flow through the pulmonary circulation and hypoperfusion of the systemic circulation. The physiologic consequences of this &quot;ductal steal&quot; depend upon the size of the shunt and the response of the heart, lungs, and other organs to the shunt. Moderate to large shunts may result in pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and decreased perfusion and oxygen delivery to end-organs. (See <a href=\"#H10685851\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects and clinical implications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following clinical features are seen in preterm infants with a PDA.
