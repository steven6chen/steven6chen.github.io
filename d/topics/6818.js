The 28 day case mortality rate for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) among patients in developed nations is approximately 10 percent, but varies with the severity of disease and the treatment provided. Less than 15 to 30 percent of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with nontraumatic chest pain have ACS, which includes myocardial infarction and unstable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Coronary blood flow is reduced and myocardial ischemia occurs. The degree and duration of the oxygen supply-demand mismatch determines whether the patient develops reversible myocardial ischemia without injury (unstable angina) or myocardial ischemia with injury (myocardial infarction). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of platelets in coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic dissection &ndash; The incidence of aortic dissection is estimated at 3 per 100,000 patients per year. This number may be a gross underestimation of the true incidence as many patients die prior to diagnosis. Aortic dissection most commonly affects patients with systemic hypertension in their seventh decade of life. Dissection typically begins with a tear in the inner layer of the aortic wall allowing blood to track between the intima (inner layer) and media (middle layer). Pulsatile blood flow causes propagation of the dissection with subsequent obstruction of branch arteries and ischemic injury to areas perfused by those vessels. In approximately 13 percent of cases, no intimal tear is identified. Such patients have an acute aortic syndrome likely caused by bleeding of the vasa vasorum with intramural hematoma formation in the wall of the aorta. The clinical picture is similar to classic aortic dissection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary embolism &ndash; The incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) is estimated at over 1 in 1000 patients, but the diagnosis is often missed and the incidence may be higher. Mortality rates vary widely based upon comorbid conditions and the size of the embolus. Early diagnosis and treatment reduce mortality for large hemodynamically unstable pulmonary emboli. Pulmonary embolism occurs when a dislodged venous clot migrates through the right side of the heart and becomes lodged at the branch point of the pulmonary arteries (saddle embolus) or more distally. Occlusion of pulmonary blood flow results in pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, poor gas exchange, and ultimately parenchymal infarction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumothorax &ndash; Pneumothorax can occur following trauma or pulmonary procedures. It also occurs spontaneously in patients with underlying lung disease (secondary pneumothorax) and without (primary pneumothorax). Patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax tend to be younger males who are tall and thin. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs with greatest frequency in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. Regardless of etiology, the accumulation of air in the pleural space can lead to tension pneumothorax with compression of the mediastinum, causing rapid clinical deterioration and death if unrecognized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mediastinitis &ndash; Common causes of mediastinitis include odontogenic infections, esophageal perforation, and iatrogenic complications of cardiac surgery or upper gastrointestinal and airway procedures. Mortality for patients with mediastinitis remains high (14 to 42 percent), even when treated with operative debridement and antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Delays in diagnosis further increase mortality.

Tamponade covers a spectrum of clinical severity. Some patients have mild compromise, while others develop a severe compromise in cardiac filling, producing a picture resembling cardiogenic shock that requires emergent reduction in pericardial pressure by pericardiocentesis. Tamponade may occur with aortic dissection, after thoracic trauma, or as a consequence of acute pericarditis from infection, malignancy, uremia, or some other cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Common conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Below is a brief description of diseases that commonly occur among emergency department (ED) patients complaining of chest pain. Gastrointestinal problems, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, comprise a significant number of such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Common causes of chest pain that are not life-threatening are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

Patients with stable angina can usually identify their anginal chest pain and relay a history of exertional triggers. Valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve prolapse and aortic stenosis, may cause chest discomfort, which may signify worsening valvular function. Infectious or inflammatory causes of chest discomfort include pericarditis, myocarditis, and endocarditis. Accumulation of pericardial fluid can result in chest discomfort as can cardiac arrhythmias, especially if coronary blood flow is impaired.

Chest tightness is a common complaint with asthma exacerbations. A number of disease processes can result in increased pulmonary arterial pressures and resultant right sided heart dysfunction (cor pulmonale). Pulmonary malignancy can cause chest pain particularly if there is pleural involvement. Chest heaviness or discomfort may be noted with pleural effusions.

A sliding hiatal hernia may result in chest pain. Pain from pancreatitis can be referred to the chest. Gastrointestinal causes account for the symptoms of a sizable number of patients who complain of chest pain and do not have an acute coronary syndrome.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postherpetic-neuralgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postherpetic neuralgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thoracic organs share afferent nervous system pathways. This creates significant overlap in the symptoms patients experience when thoracic organs develop disease, and makes it difficult to distinguish which organ system is involved purely on the basis of history. Patient descriptions of their symptoms can be helpful in some instances, but emergency clinicians must guard against premature diagnostic closure based upon history. Several studies demonstrate that so-called &quot;atypical&quot; presentations occur more often than was previously thought and misinterpretation of such presentations increases the risk for misdiagnosis and adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtain a detailed history of the patient's chest pain, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of pain (eg, abrupt or gradual)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Provocation/Palliation</span> (which activities provoke pain; which alleviate pain)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality of pain (eg, sharp, squeezing, pleuritic)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation (eg, shoulder, jaw, back)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Site of pain (eg, substernal, chest wall, diffuse, localized)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing (eg, constant or episodic, duration of episodes, when pain began)</p><p/><p>Ask about prior diagnostic studies (eg, stress test or coronary CT angiography) for similar symptoms or prior procedures (eg, cardiac catheterization). Ask whether the discomfort is similar to prior illness. Associated symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, dyspnea, syncope, and palpitations, can be helpful. Preceding or concomitant symptoms, such as fever or peripheral edema, may point to a diagnosis. Ask about risk factors for life-threatening illness, especially acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolus, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbidities: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, malignancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent events: trauma, major surgery or medical procedures (eg, endoscopy), periods of immobilization (eg, long plane ride)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other factors: cocaine use, cigarette use, family history</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Onset of pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of the onset of chest pain can help to narrow the differential diagnosis. Pain that starts suddenly and is severe at onset is associated with aortic dissection, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism. Abrupt onset of pain was reported in 85 percent of patients in one registry of patients with acute aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Chest pain associated with pulmonary embolism can begin suddenly, but may worsen over time. Nontraumatic pneumothorax most often occurs suddenly at rest, without any precipitating event. A history of forceful vomiting preceding symptoms in a toxic appearing patient raises concern for a ruptured esophagus and mediastinitis. However, a significant portion of patients who rupture their esophagus give no history of vomiting and presentations vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Conversely, discomfort from an acute coronary syndrome typically starts gradually and may worsen with exertion. With stable angina, discomfort occurs only when activity creates an oxygen demand that outstrips supply limitations imposed by a fixed atherosclerotic lesion. This occurs at relatively predictable points and changes slowly over time. Unstable angina represents an abrupt change from baseline functioning, which may manifest as discomfort that begins at lower levels of exercise or at rest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain quality and location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients often describe the symptoms of an <strong>acute coronary syndrome</strong> (ACS) as discomfort rather than pain. The discomfort may be a pressure, heaviness, tightness, fullness, or squeezing. Ischemia is less likely if the discomfort is knifelike, sharp, pleuritic, or positional. The classic location is substernal or in the left chest, and radiation to the arm, neck, jaw, back, abdomen, or shoulders may occur. Pain that radiates to the shoulders or occurs with exertion significantly increases the relative risk for ACS. </p><p>Relief of pain following the administration of sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> does <strong>not</strong> reliably distinguish between cardiac ischemia and noncardiac causes of chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Beware of &quot;atypical&quot; presentations of ACS, which are common and occur more often in the elderly, diabetics, and women. Patients with &quot;atypical&quot; symptoms (eg, dyspnea, weakness) associated with their myocardial infarction fare worse than patients who experience typical symptoms, likely due to delays in diagnosis and treatment. These issues are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department&quot;, section on 'Atypical symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>An aortic dissection most often presents with the sudden onset of sharp, severe pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>]. Patients may describe the pain as tearing, or ripping. However, according to the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD), presentations can be diverse and classic findings absent. The pain most often occurs in the chest, but can begin in the back, and may migrate or radiate into other areas of the chest, back, or abdomen, depending upon the portion of the aorta involved and the extent of the dissection. Sharp pain may also accompany pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or pericarditis.</p><p>A <strong>pulmonary embolism</strong> (PE) can create different kinds of pain, or painless dyspnea. Pain associated with PE may worsen with deep inspiration, and may localize to the chest wall. Patients with <strong>pneumothorax</strong> report ipsilateral chest pain which may initially be sharp and pleuritic but may become dull or achy over time. The discomfort of <strong>pericarditis</strong> is classically positional: worse when lying supine and relieved somewhat when leaning forward. It may also worsen with deep inspiration.</p><p>Sharp, well-localized pain reproduced with movement or palpation of the chest wall is characteristic of <strong>musculoskeletal</strong> causes. Often the patient relates a history of trauma or strenuous activity prior to developing pain.</p><p>Burning pain in the chest and epigastrium is commonly associated with gastrointestinal causes. <strong>Esophageal rupture</strong> can cause chest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal pain. Cardiac disease can cause identical symptoms, however, and emergency clinicians must avoid prematurely attributing such symptoms to gastrointestinal disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting frequently accompany chest discomfort associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but are not predictive of ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Elderly patients with ACS may only complain of symptoms other than chest pain, such as dyspnea, weakness, altered mental status, or syncope. Symptoms, such as diaphoresis and nausea, may also occur with nonischemic chest pain, including aortic dissection, pulmonary embolus, acute heart failure, and esophageal spasm.</p><p>Aortic dissection has a wide range of potential associated symptoms, depending on the arterial branches involved, which may confound the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77441\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77441 \">table 1</a>). According to one review, syncope accompanies 13 percent of dissections involving the ascending aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Neurological symptoms, ranging from hoarseness to paraplegia and altered mental status, occur in 18 to 30 percent of patients with aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. ACS can occur when the dissection involves the coronary arteries.</p><p>Shortness of breath frequently accompanies pulmonary causes of chest pain and may be the predominant symptom in pulmonary embolus, pneumothorax, and pneumonia. Tachypnea is common with PE and may be accompanied by wheezing and fever. Young healthy patients may manifest only a relative tachypnea or tachycardia despite the presence of pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. Dyspnea is often the only complaint among elderly patients with ACS.</p><p>Cough, syncope, and hemoptysis may occur with pulmonary embolism or valvular heart disease (particularly mitral stenosis), although cough and hemoptysis are more common with bronchitis, pharyngitis, or exacerbations of COPD. Dyspnea and cough may accompany pericardial and pleural effusions regardless of etiology.</p><p>Preceding or concomitant pain and swelling in an extremity suggests deep venous thrombosis (DVT) complicated by pulmonary embolism. DVT occurs most often in the lower extremities but clots may also originate in the upper extremities and the large veins of the pelvis, where they may produce bilateral lower extremity swelling if the inferior vena cava becomes occluded.</p><p>Nausea and belching frequently accompany gastrointestinal causes of chest pain, but can also occur in patients with inferior myocardial infarction. Fever raises concern for infectious causes, but is also associated with pericarditis, myocarditis, and rarely acute myocardial infarction.

Cardiac risk factors are poor predictors of acute risk in symptomatic emergency department (ED) patients, as the presence of chest pain outweighs their predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The absence of cardiac risk factors does not identify patients that can safely be discharged from the ED. Cocaine or amphetamine use raises concern for ACS regardless of other risk factors. Cocaine increases the metabolic demands of the heart via its stimulant effects, and also causes coronary artery vasoconstriction and promotes thrombus formation in patients who may otherwise be at low risk for ACS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of <strong>aortic dissection</strong> must be considered in patients with inherited connective tissue diseases and other diseases that weaken the structural architecture of the aortic wall. Patients younger than 40 years of age with Marfan's syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, cocaine use, or pregnancy are at risk for aortic dissection. Other factors that predispose to aortic dissection include: a history of previous aortic surgery and recent cardiac surgery or catheterization. Aortic dissection occurs most often in patients with systemic hypertension and advanced age, but so do many other causes of chest pain.

Also at risk are pregnant patients, patients with cancer, lung, or chronic heart disease, and those with a personal or family history of hypercoagulability. Use of oral contraceptives or chemotherapeutic agents that raise serum levels of estrogen or progestin also confers increased risk. A significant number of patients with PE may have no identifiable risk factor at the time of diagnosis, but subsequent testing reveals a predisposition for venous thrombosis (eg, Factor V Leiden mutation).

Smoking is also an independent risk factor for spontaneous <strong>pneumothorax</strong>, regardless of underlying lung disease. A high prevalence of spontaneous pneumothorax exists among HIV infected patients with pneumocystis carinii (<em>P. jirovecii</em>) pneumonia. Young females with endometriosis may experience menses-related pneumothoraces, also referred to as catamenial pneumothorax, if pleural involvement exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

As an example, a recent cardiac catheterization or coronary CT angiogram with normal or minimally diseased vessels virtually eliminates the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). An observational study of 1977 consecutive patients with coronary arteriograms documenting minimal (ie, less than 25 percent) stenosis or normal coronary arteries found that 98 percent of these patients were free of myocardial infarction 10 years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Conversely, a prior negative stress test is not useful to rule out ACS in patients with active chest pain in the ED.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most often the physical examination is not helpful in distinguishing patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) from those with noncardiac chest pain. In some instances, physical findings suggest a specific noncardiac diagnosis. Patients with an immediately life-threatening cause for their chest pain tend to appear anxious and distressed and may be diaphoretic and dyspneic.</p><p>Physical examination findings in patients with aortic dissection may be absent or suggestive of other entities including stroke, myocardial infarction, and intraabdominal catastrophe, depending on the affected arteries. Discrepancies in pulses or blood pressure are notable findings. In the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD), signs of dissection included: murmur of aortic insufficiency (32 percent) pulse deficit (15 percent), signs of shock or cardiac tamponade (8 percent), acute heart failure (7 percent), and cerebrovascular accident (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Up to 30 percent of patients may have neurologic findings.</p><p>Chest pain associated with focal wheezing or asymmetric extremity swelling raises concern for pulmonary embolus (PE). Most often patients with PE have a normal extremity examination. Unilateral decreased breath sounds may be noted with pneumothorax; subcutaneous emphysema is uncommon.</p><p>The presence of rales, with or without an S3 gallop, is associated with left ventricular dysfunction and left-sided heart failure, possibly due to ACS. Jugular venous distention, hepatojugular reflux, and peripheral edema suggest right-sided heart failure, possibly due to ACS or PE. A new systolic murmur is an ominous sign, which may signify papillary muscle dysfunction or a ventricular septal defect. Clinicians may hear a pericardial friction rub in patients with pericarditis. Hamman's crunch is a crackling sound similar to a pericardial friction rub heard over the mediastinum in patients with mediastinal emphysema.</p><p>Epigastric tenderness and heme positive stool suggest a possible gastrointestinal source for pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ANCILLARY STUDIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute coronary syndrome &ndash; A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is obtained for all emergency department (ED) patients presenting with chest pain that may be from an acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

A single ECG performed during the patient's initial presentation detects fewer than 50 percent of AMIs. Patients with normal or nonspecific ECGs have a 1 to 5 percent incidence of AMI and a 4 to 23 percent incidence of unstable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. The ECG can be repeated as frequently as every 10 minutes if the initial ECG is not diagnostic but the patient remains symptomatic and there remains high clinical suspicion for AMI. Prior ECGs are important for determining whether abnormalities are new. The presence of a left bundle branch block makes it difficult to determine the presence of ischemic ECG changes.

The most common finding is sinus tachycardia. The classically described finding &quot;S1Q3T3&quot; (ie, prominent S wave in lead I, Q wave in lead III, and inverted T wave in lead III) reflects right heart strain but is neither sensitive nor specific for PE. Patients with acute PE rarely have a normal ECG, but a wide range of abnormalities is possible and most are equally likely to be seen in patients without PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. If the clinical scenario suggests PE, evidence of right heart strain further increases suspicion.

Troponin I has a higher specificity for myocardial necrosis than CK-MB in these patients. CK-MB is no longer recommended for most patients being evaluated for an acute coronary syndrome. Negative initial cardiac biomarker determinations are not used to determine discharge but abbreviated interval testing (at 0 and 3 hours) using high sensitivity troponins may allow for safe discharge and reduce additional testing in patients otherwise at low risk for ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].

Improved imaging with multidetector CT scanners allows for visualization of pulmonary emboli in the subsegmental pulmonary arteries, although smaller emboli are of questionable clinical significance. CT pulmonary angiography combined with venography can detect a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using a single dose of contrast agent. Duplex ultrasonography can be helpful in patients at risk for PE with physical findings suggestive of DVT. Pulmonary angiography, once the gold standard, is rarely used. Nuclear <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> lung scanning is still used, but frequently results in subsequent imaging because of the high number of indeterminant studies.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-patients-with-chest-pain-at-low-or-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of patients with chest pain at low or intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Keep the following guidance in mind when considering the diagnosis of ACS for a patient with acute chest pain. Assume that any patient who presents with symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome within a few days or weeks following percutaneous coronary interventions (eg, angioplasty or stent placement) or coronary artery bypass grafting has an abruptly occluded coronary artery or graft until proven otherwise. Remain cautious when assessing the elderly, diabetics, and women, who are more likely to manifest &quot;atypical&quot; symptoms with ACS. Never rely on a single ECG or a single set of cardiac biomarkers to rule out ACS, unless symptoms have been continuous and prolonged (ie, over six to eight hours). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department&quot;, section on 'Disposition of patient without STEMI'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic dissection &ndash; According to one prospective observational study, the probability of aortic dissection increases significantly with the presence of the following findings:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History: Abrupt onset of thoracic or abdominal pain with a sharp, tearing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ripping character</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Examination: A variation in pulse (absence of a proximal extremity or carotid pulse) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood pressure (&gt;20 mmHg difference between the right and left arm)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chest radiograph (CXR): Mediastinal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aortic widening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The emergency clinician should look for these examination and radiographic findings in any patient with a history suggestive of aortic dissection. According to this study, aortic dissection occurs in approximately 83 percent of patients with classic aortic dissection pain and suggestive CXR findings, and approximately 92 percent of patients with classic pain and an absent pulse or significant difference in blood pressure. When all three variables coexist, aortic dissection is present in all patients. When no variables are present approximately 7 percent of patients have aortic dissection. Definitive diagnostic testing is determined by the patient's hemodynamic stability and the imaging modalities available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary embolism &ndash; Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially life-threatening disease frequently missed by emergency clinicians because of its wide range of presentations and nonspecific findings on examination, electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray. Often the biggest problem with PE is failure to consider the diagnosis. Emergency clinicians must consider PE a potential diagnosis in any patient with acute chest discomfort or dyspnea who lacks a firm alternative diagnosis (eg, myocardial infarction diagnosed by history and elevated ST segments, pericardial tamponade diagnosed by ultrasound).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The approach to patients with potential PE focuses on risk stratification. Patients with symptoms suggestive of PE and right ventricular heart dysfunction or hemodynamic instability are at high risk and may benefit from emergent thrombolysis or embolectomy. For all other patients, risk stratification depends on the pretest probability for PE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several scoring systems exist to characterize patient risk for PE, including the Wells score, the Charlotte criteria, the revised Geneva score, and the PERC rule. For patients at low-clinical risk it is generally reasonable to withhold anticoagulant therapy while a D-dimer test is performed. In patients at low risk, PE can be ruled out with a negative D-dimer test, provided the test is of high sensitivity. Patients at low risk but whose D-dimer test is positive and those at higher risk require further testing. The PERC rule identifies patients at sufficiently low risk for PE that even D-dimer testing may be unnecessary. Detailed discussions of risk stratification, diagnosis, and management are found separately.

A suggestive history combined with hemodynamic compromise and unilateral diminished breath sounds is the usual presentation. Treatment should not be delayed for confirmation by chest x-ray (CXR). A CXR or bedside ultrasound may be used to make the diagnosis in patients without signs of tension.

CT scan may show extraesophageal air, periesophageal fluid, mediastinal widening, and air and fluid in the pleural spaces, retroperitoneum or lesser sac. The diagnosis is confirmed with the oral administration of a water soluble contrast agent followed by chest radiography looking for extravasation of contrast.

Life-threatening problems are treated immediately, without delay for confirmatory testing. Any patient with acute chest pain at risk for a life-threatening disease is placed on a cardiac monitor and given supplemental oxygen if necessary while intravenous access is established. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest x-ray (CXR) are obtained.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute coronary syndrome &ndash; Management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is determined largely by electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. Serial ECGs dramatically increase the sensitivity for detecting ACS, compared with a single initial ECG. Patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) require emergent revascularization via percutaneous intervention or fibrinolysis. The management of ACS is discussed in detail elsewhere.

This is best achieved via a combination of beta blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a>) and sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>). Beta blockers should be started first to prevent potential rebound tachycardia associated with the vasodilatory effects of sodium nitroprusside. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Labetalol</a>, which has both beta and alpha blocking effects, can also be used to manage blood pressure.

There is no evidence demonstrating that empiric anticoagulation should be initiated before test results are obtained. Patients with massive or submassive emboli may require more aggressive therapy with thrombolytics or embolectomy.

Treatment should not be delayed for confirmation by chest x-ray (CXR). Symptomatic pneumothoraces not under tension are treated most often with tube thoracostomy, but smaller pneumothoraces may be amenable to aspiration and observation.

Early tamponade with only mild hemodynamic compromise may be treated conservatively, with careful monitoring, serial echocardiographic studies, avoidance of volume depletion, and therapy aimed at the underlying cause. The decision to drain an effusion must take into account the clinical assessment, echocardiographic findings, and the risk of the procedure.

Exercise treadmill or pharmacological testing with or without nuclear imaging, as well as stress echocardiography and CT coronary angiography, can assist cardiovascular risk stratification in the ED. Patients with an uneventful observation period, negative serial cardiac markers, and a normal stress test can be safely discharged with a referral for follow-up.
