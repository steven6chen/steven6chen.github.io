The incidence of infection due to <em>C. canimorsus</em> in the general population is low. National surveillance for <em>Capnocytophaga</em> species is not performed in the United States; a national survey in the Netherlands noted 0.67 cases per million per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The prevalence among immunocompromised hosts is likely substantially higher than that of the general population. The case fatality rate in case series is 28 to 31 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]; mortality is high even among patients who are immunocompetent.</p><p><em>C. canimorsus</em> is the most common cause of severe <em>Capnocytophaga</em> infection in humans. Risk factors for <em>C. canimorsus</em> infection include a history of a dog bite and immunocompromise, particularly asplenia, functional asplenia, cirrhosis, or history of heavy alcohol use. Most (72 to 74 percent) of these infections occur in men, with a peak among individuals 50 to 70 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/1,2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5</a>]. Approximately half (43 to 56 percent) of patients report a history of a dog bite; others report scratches from dogs or occasionally cats or exposure to dogs without bites or scratches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/1-4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458603078\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Capnocytophaga</em> is a genus in the family Flavobacteriaceae. <em>Capnocytophaga</em> species are slow growing, capnophilic (&quot;carbon loving&quot;), facultative anaerobes. They are long, thin, and generally fusiform gram-negative rods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100273\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100273 \">picture 1</a>), which may become pleomorphic with prolonged growth.</p><p>The <em>Capnocytophaga</em> genus consists of nine species: <em>C. ochracea, C. gingivalis, C. sputigena, C. leadbetteri, C. haemolytica,</em> <em>C. granulosa, C. canimorsus</em>,<em> C. cynodegmi</em>, <em>C. canis</em>, the putative novel species <em>C. stomatis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and one unnamed taxon, AHN8471. These species are subdivided into two groups based on whether they inhabit the oral cavity of humans or inhabit the oral cavity of dogs and occasionally cats. <em>C. canimorsus, C. cynodegmi,</em> and <em>C. stomatis </em>are found in the oral cavity of dogs and cats, whereas all the other species are found in the human oral cavity.</p><p>The microbiome of the human oral cavity is remarkably heterogeneous, with over 400 species identified by 16S sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. <em>C. ochracea, C. gingivalis, </em>and <em>C. sputigena</em> are normal flora of the subgingival sulcus of humans, whereas <em>C. leadbetteri, C. haemolytica</em>, and<em> C. granulosa</em> have been isolated from dental plaque in healthy humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p><em>C. canimorsus,</em> <em>C. cynodegmi</em>, <em>C. canis,</em> and perhaps <em>C. stomatis</em> are normal flora of the dog oral cavity. <em>C. canimorsus</em> is responsible for the vast majority of <em>Capnocytophaga</em> infections resulting from dog bites, whereas <em>C. cynodegmi</em> rarely causes infection in humans. <em>C. canimorsus</em> is present in the oral cavity of 67 to 86 percent of dogs and 55 to 84 percent of cats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2831464961\"><span class=\"h2\">Susceptibility testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful antibiotic susceptibility testing is warranted. In one study including five <em>C. canimorsus</em> isolates from bloodstream infections and nine <em>Capnocytophaga</em> isolates of various species from wound infections, all <em>C. canimorsus</em> isolates were susceptible to penicillin, cephalosporins, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, four of the nine wound isolates were resistant to penicillin, cephalosporins, and imipenem; genomic analysis revealed the presence of a class D beta-lactamase. Resistant isolates were the dog-associated species <em>C. cynodegmi</em> or <em>C. stomatis</em>, not <em>C. canimorsus</em>. All <span class=\"nowrap\">beta-lactamase/carbapenemase-resistant</span> isolates were susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H458603139\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>In another study, the presence of beta-lactamase genes among isolates of <em>Capnocytophaga</em> species that originate in the human oral cavity was highest among patients with periodontitis (82 percent of isolates), intermediate among patients with hematologic diseases (50 percent of isolates), and lowest among healthy volunteers (16 percent of isolates) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Three <em>Capnocytophaga</em> isolates of human-derived species that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have been identified in France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]; these isolates were susceptible to imipenem-cilastatin, and two of the three were susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458603084\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of <em>Capnocytophaga</em> species, particularly their ability to cause fulminant sepsis in asplenic and functionally asplenic patients, is not well understood. Pathogenesis investigations have largely focused on <em>C. canimorsus</em>. Virulence factors that have been characterized are described here.</p><p><em>C. canimorsus</em> forages sugars from glycoproteins in human cells, including phagocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The genome contains 13 loci that encode polysaccharide utilization loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], which enable the utilization of host starch as an energy source for the bacterium. These polysaccharide utilization proteins cover the bacterial surface, constituting more than half of the bacterial surface proteome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Similar polysaccharide utilization loci are present in members of the Flavibacteria and <em>Bacteroides</em>. One of the polysaccharide utilization systems in <em>C. canimorsus</em> utilizes N-acetylglucosamine harvested from host glycoproteins to synthesize the bacterial peptidoglycan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]; included among these host glycoproteins is human immunoglobulin (Ig)G [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Of note, in cirrhosis and other liver disease, glycosylation of many serum glycoproteins is altered, with measurable increases in N-acetyl glucosamine-containing glycoproteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], leading to speculation that bacterial degradation of IgG per se <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the increase in the serum of glycoprotein molecules metabolized by these organisms may contribute to pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p><em>C. canimorsus</em> inhibits the ability of macrophages to kill bacteria and inhibits phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. <em>C. canimorsus </em>and other <em>Capnocytophaga</em> species possess a polysaccharide capsule on the surface that impedes complement-mediated killing and phagocytosis by macrophages and a surface lipooligosaccharide that inhibits Toll-like receptor 4 signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/15,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458603090\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458603097\"><span class=\"h2\">Septic shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most severe presentation of <em>Capnocytophaga</em> infection is acute onset of severe sepsis accompanied by fever, disseminated purpuric lesions, hypotension, acute renal insufficiency, and altered mental status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/2,4,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,29</a>]. The rash may evolve to purpura fulminans or frank gangrene. The systemic inflammatory response leads to microvascular injury and endothelial damage that may cause disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorgan failure. <em>C. canimorsus</em> is the species of <em>Capnocytophaga</em> most commonly associated with septic shock, but other species of <em>Capnocytophaga</em> may cause a similar syndrome.</p><p>Patients at greatest risk for septic shock include immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with asplenia, functional asplenia, cirrhosis, or history of heavy alcohol use. In large case series, up to two-thirds of the patients with <em>C. canimorsus</em> septicemia were immunocompromised: 10 to 33 percent were asplenic, 7 to 22 percent had a history of alcohol abuse, and 5 percent were receiving treatment with corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Additional immunocompromised states that have been reported include oral mucositis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral ulceration in the setting of granulocytopenia, acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, solid tumors, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple myeloma, and acute myelofibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In addition, there are case reports of sepsis due to <em>Capnocytophaga</em> species in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and following bone marrow transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>In approximately half of cases, there is a history of dog bite or other contact with dog saliva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>] and occasionally a history of cat scratch or contact with cat saliva. The delay between dog bite and clinical presentation ranges from 1 to 30 days, with an average of 5 to 6 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458603103\"><span class=\"h2\">Other presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Capnocytophaga</em> species can cause a variety of other clinical presentations. In one case series, diagnoses included sepsis or septic shock (41 percent of patients), fever of unknown origin (13 percent), meningitis (13 percent), cellulitis (11 percent), and respiratory tract infection (7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].<em> C. canimorsus</em> can cause pneumonia (which may be complicated by empyema), soft tissue infection, meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, purpura fulminans, and cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/2,35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,35-39</a>]. In older adults, it is a rare cause of meningitis (&lt;1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>There are case reports of <em>Capnocytophaga</em> species from the human oral cavity (<em>C. ochracea, C. gingivalis, C. sputigena, C. leadbetteri, C. haemolytica,</em> and<em> C. granulosa</em>) associated with wound infections, soft tissue abscesses, ocular infections, bacteremia, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, peritonitis associated with peritoneal dialysis, lymphadenitis, abdominal abscess, lung abscess, empyema, aortitis, and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/41-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-47</a>]. Most of these infections occur in immunocompromised hosts, but any can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals.</p><p>In addition, <em>Capnocytophaga</em> species in the human oral cavity colonize the subgingival sulcus and supragingival plaque and can cause localized juvenile periodontitis and other types of periodontal disease; <em>C. ochracea</em> and <em>C. granulosa</em> are the most prevalent species isolated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. These species are also occasionally isolated from the vagina and can cause intrauterine device infection, preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, and neonatal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>In the setting of meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid may demonstrate a lower pleocytosis (200 to 2000 white blood <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mL)</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a higher percentage of lymphocytes (15 to 30 percent) than meningitis caused by other bacteria, more typical of that seen in <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/2,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,51-53</a>].</p><p>Sensorineural hearing loss has been described as a permanent complication of several cases of C.<em> canimorsus</em> meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]; it is unclear whether it occurs more commonly with this infection than other bacterial causes of meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458603109\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of <em>Capnocytophaga</em> infection is established via culture. The organisms grow slowly and identification of the organism may take several days. Therefore, the microbiology laboratory should be alerted when <em>Capnocytophaga</em> infection is suspected; in such cases, specimens should be held for extended incubation.</p><p><em>C. canimorsus</em> is more fastidious than other species and requires enriched agar; blood cultures turn positive after 1 to 14 days (mean 6 days) of incubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. <em>Capnocytophaga</em> organisms grow on blood or chocolate agar with optimal growth at 35 to 37&ordm;C in the presence of 5 to 10 percent CO<sub>2</sub>. Colonies on plates typically take two to four days to reach sufficient size for analysis. The colonies of zoonotic species <em>C. canimorsus</em> and <em>C. cynodegmi</em> are unpigmented, whereas colonies of human species of <em>Capnocytophaga</em> may be pigmented.</p><p>Microscopic examination of a buffy coat or peripheral smear for fusiform gram-negative organisms within the cytoplasm of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100706\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100706 \">picture 2</a>) can expedite the diagnosis of <em>Capnocytophaga</em> infection in some cases, particularly among asplenic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capnocytophaga/abstract/4,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,54</a>].</p><p>Commercial biochemical identification panels may be unreliable for identification of the <em>Capnocytophaga</em> species.
