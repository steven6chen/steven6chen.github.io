Until the outcome of IL-1 inhibition treatment is demonstrated to be safe and effective for organ transplant recipients, use of these approaches for the treatment and prevention of acute gout is not recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5149503\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced uric acid excretion can occur after renal transplant, particularly in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> to prevent graft rejection. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired renal urate excretion frequently leads to hyperuricemia and, not uncommonly, to gouty arthritis. Gouty arthritis is often difficult to treat because of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the interaction of gout medications (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febuxostat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">febuxostat</a>) with agents commonly used in transplant recipients (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, diuretics). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic treatment and prevention of gout is not without risk in the transplant recipient and warrants management by physicians experienced with the clinical problems likely to be encountered. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia should not be treated in the organ transplant recipient. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colchicine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> both inhibit p-glycoprotein action, so, for acute gout flare treatment in a transplant recipient receiving cyclosporine or another p-glycoprotein inhibitor, colchicine administration should be limited to a single oral dose of 0.6 mg and not repeated for at least three days. For gout flare prophylaxis, a colchicine dose of 0.3 mg daily or every other day (depending on renal functional status) can be given. In either case, careful monitoring for colchicine-induced myoneuropathy and blood cytopenias should be undertaken to mitigate the potential consequences of excessive colchicine levels. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Colchicine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative approaches to flare management include short-term NSAID use and supplementation of the baseline corticosteroid dose most transplant recipients receive. Slow (over 10 to 14 days) rather than rapid tapering of corticosteroids to the baseline dose is recommended to avoid rebound gout flares. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Increased glucocorticoid dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term serum urate lowering in transplant recipients needs to be undertaken with special care.

Accumulation of 6-mercaptopurine can result in severe bone marrow toxicity in the setting of coadministration of azathioprine and a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Replacement of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> (which does not affect xanthine oxidase activity) for graft protection presents a suitable option if gout management mandates use of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Regarding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> use in the general gout population, prior recommendations regarding allopurinol dose restriction according to creatinine clearance have been replaced by strong recommendations for serum urate- and creatinine-monitored allopurinol dose titration to the achievement and maintenance of sub-saturating serum urate levels &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. The latter approach should be applicable to organ transplant recipients, with, however, special attention to high prevalence in this group of renal functional impairment and diuretic use, which are risk factors for allopurinol-adverse reactions. Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febuxostat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">febuxostat</a> (doses of which should be titrated to effect, but do not need dose adjustment when creatinine clearance exceeds 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> should be considered as an alternative to allopurinol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In transplant recipients with normal or near-normal renal function, use of a uricosuric agent may be considered, especially where benzbromarone is available. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Losartan</a> is the only angiotensin II receptor antagonist with uricosuric properties and may serve as a useful adjunctive agent in transplant recipients with gout.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperuricemia-and-gout-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lin HY, Rocher LL, McQuillan MA, et al.
