They persist as a function of the acid or peptic activity in gastric juice. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is an important cause of morbidity and healthcare costs. The natural history of peptic ulcer ranges from resolution without intervention to the development of complications with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality, such as bleeding and perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will summarize the pathogenesis and risk factors of PUD. A review of its epidemiology and major causes is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Considering the acid-peptic environment of the stomach and the noxious agents that are ingested, ulcers are surprisingly uncommon, reflecting the effectiveness of the protective mechanisms that govern gastric mucosal function and repair. Primary malfunction of these secretory, defense, or repair mechanisms is a very uncommon cause of ulcer, if it occurs at all. Most ulcers occur when the normal mechanisms are disrupted by superimposed processes such as <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection and the ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</p><p>The decreasing prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> infection has had a significant impact on the burden of ulcer disease in both developed and developing countries. In developed countries such as the United States, the prevalence of ulcer disease in young people has declined, while NSAID-related ulcers in older adults have increased due both to increased life expectancy and widespread use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Helicobacter pylori</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>H. pylori</em> affects a number of aspects of intestinal and mucosal physiology including gastric acid secretion, gastric metaplasia, immune responses, and mucosal defense mechanisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and duodenal ulcer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAIDs, via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, affect the amount of gastric acid generated, the integrity of the mucosal barrier, the amount of bicarbonate and glutathione generated, and the rate of mucosal blood flow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pathogenesis of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the understanding that the majority of peptic ulcer disease is related to <em>H. pylori</em> or NSAIDs, gastroduodenal ulcers are still &quot;peptic.&quot; With very few exceptions, complete pharmacologic inhibition of acid secretion induces ulcer healing and prevents recurrence. As a result, multiple factors are involved in the pathophysiology of most peptic ulcers.</p><p>Thus, the presence of <em>H. pylori </em>or use of NSAIDs alone is not likely to be sufficient for ulcer formation. Although gastritis is consistently observed with <em>H. pylori</em> infection and NSAIDs consistently inhibit mucosal prostaglandin production, the yearly incidence of clinical ulcer disease among subjects at risk is only approximately 1 percent for both categories of ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>There are a number of risk factors for ulcer disease, described below, such as smoking, increased acid, and decreased duodenal bicarbonate secretion. Although these factors are almost certainly of pathogenic relevance, the extent to which these three mechanisms distinguish the small subset with <em>H. pylori</em> exposure that develop ulcers from the similarly exposed majority who remain ulcer-free has not been established.</p><p>Mucosal damage from trauma, acid-peptic activity, and exposure to environmental toxins occurs in everyone on a daily basis, and the gastrointestinal mucosa has a remarkable ability to repair itself. Chronic peptic ulcers, which are focal mucosal lesions that persist or recur over time, usually in the same location, are the exception.</p><p>The following section reviews the mechanisms that contribute to peptic ulcer formation. Unfortunately, there are limited data comparing <em>H. pylori</em>-positive ulcer subjects to <em>H. pylori</em>-positive controls, and non-infected controls. There are virtually no data comparing pathogenic mechanisms in subjects who develop NSAID ulcers with subjects exposed to NSAIDs who remain ulcer-free. Similarly, there are very limited studies of pathogenic mechanisms in patients with non-<em>H. pylori</em>, non-NSAID ulcers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric acid hypersecretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although only a small proportion of duodenal ulcer (DU) subjects have true acid hypersecretion, high-normal or modestly elevated values appear to be a defining characteristic of patients with DU, whether or not they are infected with <em>H. pylori</em>.</p><p>The majority of patients infected with <em>H. pylori</em> develop a pangastritis, which over time is associated with a reduction in gastric acid secretion.10 to 15 percent of patients with the infection develop an antrum predominant gastritis that is associated with decreased antral somatostatin concentrations and increased basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Somatostatin secretion by the antral D cells is a feed-back mechanism by which gastrin secretion is regulated. The mechanism by which somatostatin secretion is inhibited may involve cytokines induced by <em>H. pylori</em> infection. Host genetic factors related to cytokines can influence the response to <em>H. pylori</em> infection and predispose to ulcer disease. </p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/8,9,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,11-13</a>]. The abnormalities in gastrin and somatostatin secretion and most abnormalities of acid secretion normalize within one year of <em>H. pylori</em> eradication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>].</p><p>Ulcer recurrence following successful <em>H. pylori</em> eradication may be more common than previously expected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A small study found higher basal and pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion in patients with recurrent ulcers following successful <em>H. pylori</em> eradication, compared with patients without recurrent ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Among <em>H. pylori</em>-negative subjects, a subset has acid hypersecretion without hypergastrinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. The mechanisms of acid hypersecretion in these patients have not been defined. One study of six patients with non-<em>H. pylori</em>, non-NSAID DU found increased gastrin response to a meal (but not fasting hypergastrinemia) and increased peak gastric acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Some subjects with non-<em>H. pylori</em>, non-NSAID hypersecretion may have a component of muscarinic-dependent, vagal hyperactivity, although this element is difficult to quantify. In the absence of <em>H. pylori</em> or gastrinoma, fasting hypergastrinemia is only rarely found in hypersecretory DU patients, sometimes linked to antral G cell hyperfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unusual causes of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>.). Taken together, these data indicate that increased acid secretion is an important factor in some patients with ulcer recurrences following successful <em>H. pylori</em> eradication and in some patients with non-<em>H. pylori</em>, non-NSAID DU.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Duodenal abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of DU patients have impaired duodenal bicarbonate secretion, which has also proven to be <em>H. pylori</em>-dependent, since cure of the infection reverses the defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and duodenal ulcer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The combination of increased gastric acid secretion and reduced duodenal bicarbonate secretion lowers the pH in the duodenum, which promotes the development of gastric metaplasia (ie, the presence of gastric epithelium in the first portion of the duodenum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p><em>H. pylori</em> infection in areas of gastric metaplasia induces duodenitis and enhances the susceptibility to acid injury, thereby possibly predisposing to DU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A study that followed 181 patients who initially had endoscopy-negative, non-ulcer dyspepsia found that duodenal colonization by <em>H. pylori</em> was a highly significant predictor of the subsequent development of DU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Excess acid secretion in gastrinoma patients is also associated with marked gastric metaplasia in the duodenum. Thus, metaplasia can be related to chronic injury that can occur independently of <em>H. pylori</em> infection. Although it is possible that duodenal gastric metaplasia is simply a consequence of duodenal injury from acid or <em>H. pylori</em>, it is an attractive hypothesis that chronic, local duodenal mucosal injury ulcer actually predisposes to focal development of DU. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and duodenal ulcer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric ulcer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A gastric ulcer (GU) occurring in the stomach proximal to the distal antrum and prepyloric region is usually associated with low-normal or low acid secretion, reflecting a low-normal parietal cell mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These findings correspond to the encroachment of oxyntic mucosa by advancing antritis and oxyntic gland atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In contrast to GU involving the gastric body, patients with ulcers in the distal antrum or GU associated with concurrent DU have normal or even increased levels of acid secretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial aggregation and genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperpepsinogenemia was proposed as a marker of autosomal dominant inheritance of predisposition to peptic ulcer. Subsequent follow-up of these same subjects revealed that this pattern of hyperpepsinogenemia was in fact due to familial clustering of <em>H. pylori</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Questions have to be reframed for the <em>H. pylori</em> era: First, are genetic factors involved in predisposing to <em>H. pylori</em> infection or in predisposing to certain disease outcomes in infected individuals? Second, are there genetic factors that operate independently of <em>H. pylori</em>?</p><p>Host factors appear to be important in predisposing to <em>H. pylori</em> infection and to disease outcomes such as DU and gastric cancer. Genes that encode for cytokines account for the individual responses to <em>H pylori</em> infection. Genetic variations in pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1B, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&alpha;) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) are associated with peptic ulcer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A genome-wide association study found that specific genetic variations in the Prostate Stem Cell Antigen are associated with gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, and gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. TNF alpha gene polymorphisms have also been linked to duodenal ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Genetic polymorphism related to synergy between host (TNF-alpha promoter) and bacterial (induced by contact with epithelium, or the iceA1 gene) factors have been related to DU in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Twin studies provide evidence for a clear genetic predisposition to PUD that is independent of any predisposition to <em>H. pylori</em> infection. An illustrative report found high concordance of a self-reported ulcer history in monozygotic, compared with dizygotic, twins regardless of whether they were reared apart or together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Cross-twin, cross-trait correlations for monozygotic and dizygotic twins indicated that genetic effects for peptic ulcer were independent of genetic influences for <em>H. pylori</em>. Another twin study also concluded that genetic factors were linked to DU, independent of environmental variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Although hyperpepsinogenemia may be related to <em>H. pylori</em> infection, Italian investigators identified a family in which peptic ulcer was linked to elevated serum pepsinogen group A in the absence of <em>H. pylori</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>An association has been reported between peptic ulcer and several indirect &quot;genetic&quot; markers. Blood groups O and A, the Lewis phenotype Le(a + b-), and non-secretors of ABH in particular have been associated for increased risk of peptic ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. However, other studies have failed to find any association of blood group O with <em>H. pylori</em> infection or with peptic ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Thus, the relation between Lewis antigen expression, <em>H. pylori</em> attachment, and peptic ulcer disease is unclear. Studies suggest that strains of <em>H. pylori</em> from different areas of the world may have different binding affinities for gastric epithelium accounting for the seemingly contradictory results seen with blood group studies from different countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Smokers were more likely to develop ulcers, and the ulcers were more difficult to treat and were associated with a higher rate of recurrence.</p><p>In a prospective study of 7624 American men of Japanese ancestry in Hawaii, for example, the ulcer risk progressively increased with increasing pack-years of cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Although negative studies have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], the weight of evidence supports an association between smoking and PUD in <em>H. pylori</em>-infected subject [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/17,39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,39,41</a>]. A population-based study conducted between 1997 and 2003 found that the prevalence of ulcer disease in current and former smokers was 11.5 percent almost twice as high as non-smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>However, smoking does <strong>not</strong> appear to be a risk factor for ulcer relapse once <em>H. pylori</em> has been eradicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. In one report, 256 patients with DU and 31 patients with GU were followed for up to 18 months after ulcer healing and successful eradication of <em>H. pylori</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Ulcer relapse occurred in 3 of 83 smokers (3.6 percent) versus 4 of 204 nonsmokers (2 percent), a difference which was not clinically significant. Smoking also did not influence recurrence of the <em>H. pylori</em> infection, which was observed in 4.8 and 4.4 percent of smokers and nonsmokers, respectively.</p><p>There are conflicting data regarding whether smoking impairs the responsiveness of <em>H. pylori</em> to successful antibiotic cure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

Stenosis or deformity of the duodenal bulb, detected radiographically or at endoscopy, predicts impaired healing and enhanced relapse rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol in high concentrations damages the gastric mucosal barrier to hydrogen ions and is associated with acute gastric mucosal lesions characterized by mucosal hemorrhages. Alcohol also stimulates acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In addition, contents of alcoholic beverages other than alcohol are also strong stimulants of acid secretion.</p><p>Despite these acute effects, there is no evidence that alcohol intake causes or exacerbates chronic peptic ulcer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/42,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,62</a>]. Modest alcohol consumption may even promote ulcer healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/50,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,63</a>]. In contrast, alcohol abuse interferes with patient compliance and ulcer healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Folklore has incriminated dietary indiscretion as a cause of ulcers. Although certain foods, beverages, and spices cause dyspepsia, there are no convincing data that such specific foods cause, perpetuate, or reactivate peptic ulcers. There are, however, some data that implicate dietary factors may influence peptic ulcer pathogenesis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary factors have been hypothesized to account for some of the regional variation of ulcer disease, possibly related to toxins generated with storage of certain foods or from protective effects of certain foods. DU has been reported to be much more common in the rice-eating southern regions of India compared with the wheat-eating Northern regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Animal studies indicated that whereas freshly milled rice and unmilled rice were protective against damaging agents such as alcohol, stored rice bran and its oil exacerbated mucosal damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Similarly, unrefined wheat or wheat bran were protective against damage, whereas refined wheat and wheat germ were not. In South Africa, DU has been reported to be very uncommon in rural areas, where home-pounded maize is a staple of the diet, compared with urban areas. Animal studies indicate that home-pounded maize gives protection against DU, whereas commercially-manufactured maize does not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. One can only speculate whether these animal models are relevant to human disease; these theories have not been directly tested in human studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other dietary factors also may be protective. One study found a much lower consumption of chili peppers by DU patients, compared with controls, prompting the hypothesis chili peppers protected against damage, possibly by activating mucosal adaptation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary insufficiency of essential fatty acids has been proposed as a pathogenic factor in DU, possibly resulting in depletion of mucosal prostanoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. It has also been suggested that an increase in dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids was protective against <em>H. pylori</em>. Supporting evidence for these hypotheses remains weak. One study compared the effects of a diet containing polyunsaturated fatty acids versus placebo in patients with peptic ulcer and <em>H. pylori</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Fatty acids had no effect on either colonization of the stomach by <em>H. pylori</em> or antral prostaglandin levels. Similarly, a prospective study of a cohort of 47,806 men found no association between the type or amount of fat intake and the risk of DU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. However, high consumption of fruits and vegetables, dietary fiber, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> were associated with a reduced risk of ulcer disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coffee is a strong stimulant of acid secretion and produces dyspepsia in many individuals, which often results from enhanced esophageal reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Caffeine is not the only variable because decaffeination does not reduce these effects of coffee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite these observations, there is no evidence that coffee consumption is a risk factor for ulcer disease, although increased consumption may be associated with a higher rate of infection with <em>H. pylori</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/42,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,73</a>]. In one series, coffee increased dyspepsia in subjects with nonulcer dyspepsia, but not in those with DU when compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Modest coffee intake has beneficial cardiovascular effects and decreases all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. Moderate coffee consumption (two to three cups a day) should not be discouraged in patients with ulcer disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical experience indicates that food intolerances are common in patients with DU and other acid-peptic and functional gastrointestinal disorders. These symptoms appear to reflect sensitivities to substances in foods; there is no evidence that they are related directly to ulcer formation. Food intolerances are common and highly variable in the general population, making rigorous investigation challenging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent feedings, justified on the basis that small meals cause less gastric distension, may lead instead to more sustained stimulation of acid secretion. Bedtime snacks stimulate nocturnal acid secretion. There is no evidence to support the use of a bland diet or dietary restrictions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychologic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of psychodynamic factors in the genesis of peptic ulcer remains controversial despite decades of study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. Studies investigating psychologic factors are impaired by the lack of control for other known risk factors for ulcer disease and the difficulties associated with quantifying psychological stress</p><p>In light of these limitations, two lines of evidence strongly implicate psychosocial factors in ulcer pathogenesis. First, several studies have used a prospective design to address methodological limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The most useful approach has been to track ulcer incidence (new ulcers) or ulcer recurrence in a defined epidemiological cohort. Using this type of approach, studies over the last 15 years have painted a consistent picture about the importance of several forms of psychological stress as predictors of de novo ulcers incidence or ulcer recurrence. As an example, poorly tolerated stress or depressive symptoms at baseline increase the risk of ulcer development over the next 9 to 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Other psychosocial factors, such as work-related stress, social problems, and post-traumatic stress disorder, are also predictive of subsequent ulcer disease.</p><p>Second, several studies have established that peptic ulcer complications become much more prevalent during periods of natural disaster or societal catastrophe. The first such study was the demonstration of a dramatically increased rate of ulcer perforation during the German bombardment of London [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Several other studies confirm similar findings following other such events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/77,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,80</a>]. In the eight weeks following the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake, the <em>H. pylori</em> prevalence in patients without physical injury who had GU was similar to two control groups with GU unexposed to the stress of the earthquake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. This finding contrasts to hospitalized patients with peptic ulcer associated with physical injury in whom <em>H. pylori</em> prevalence was similar to the control population. These data suggest that psychological factors exacerbate both <em>H. pylori</em> and non-<em>H. pylori</em> ulcers to a similar extent. A population-based prospective study in Denmark that included 3379 individuals demonstrated that psychological stress increased the incidence of peptic ulcer in part by influencing health risk behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Stress had similar effects on ulcers associated with <em>H. pylori</em> infection and those unrelated to <em>H. pylori </em>or NSAID use. Stress, anxiety, and depression have been observed to impair endoscopic healing and to promote relapse of endoscopically diagnosed ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/62,77,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,77,83</a>]. The effects of stress seem to be reversible; patients who develop an ulcer following traumatic life events, but who are psychologically stable, tend to do well after the stress has resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiological mechanisms accounting for the effects of stress on the ulcer formation have not been defined. These effects could be mediated by both altered behaviors and by altered physiology. Pathogenic mechanisms for peptic ulcer are multifactorial, a fact that confounds unraveling the link between psychosocial factors and ulcerogenesis. As example, stress increases acid secretion, but the effects are more prominent in patients with DU compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. As a result, one must consider not only the stressor, but the individual's physiological and psychosocial response to the stress; deleterious effects may only be evident in a subset of predisposed individuals.</p><p>Lastly, finding a relationship between psychosocial factors and ulcer disease does not establish causality. One study found that anxiety and neuroticism were high in a group of DU patients at the outset, but normalized in relapse-free patients at the end of a 10-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-genetic-environmental-and-psychological-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].
