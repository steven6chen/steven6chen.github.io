In people with this condition, the airways (the branching tubes that carry air within the lungs) are wider than normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67527\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67527 \">figure 1</a>). This leads to an increase in mucus, which can be hard to cough up. When mucus stays in the lungs, people are more likely to get lung infections or bronchitis.</p><p>The most common causes of bronchiectasis in children include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystic fibrosis &ndash; This is a disease that some children are born with. It makes thick mucus build up and clog the lungs and other parts of the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74980\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74980 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other diseases a child is born with &ndash; These include lung problems or diseases that make it hard to fight infections.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A piece of food or another object stuck in the airway</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A long-lasting lung infection, such as certain types of bronchitis or pneumonia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71624446\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of bronchiectasis in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A long-lasting cough &ndash; The cough usually brings up thick, sticky mucus (sounds &quot;wet&quot;). It can last weeks or even months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent pneumonia or other lung infections &ndash; Your child might have:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chest pain that gets worse when he or she takes a breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trouble breathing or breathing that sounds like whistling (wheezing)</p><p/><p>A child with bronchiectasis might also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get tired or short of breath during exercise or play</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus infections &ndash; The sinuses are hollow areas in the bones of the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75045 \">figure 3</a>). Sinus infections can cause a stuffy nose, pain in the cheeks or forehead, and yellow or green mucus from the nose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough up blood, or have skin or lips that look blue&ndash; These symptoms are not common, but do happen in a few children with bronchiectasis.</p><p/><p><strong>Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</strong> &ndash; Yes. Call a doctor or nurse if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a cough for more than 2 weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets a cough after choking on food or another object, even if it happened several days or weeks ago</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughs up thick, dark yellow or green mucus, or thick, sticky mucus every day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughs up blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has trouble breathing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59786 \">figure 4</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a fever</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71624507\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. The doctor or nurse will do an exam and learn about your child's symptoms. Your child might have some or all of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan of the chest &ndash; A CT scan is an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of the body. It can show a detailed picture of your lungs and airways. A CT scan is usually needed to know if a person has bronchiectasis, and to see which parts of the lungs are involved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;sweat test&quot; &ndash; During this test, a doctor collects a small amount of sweat from a person's arm and measures the amount of salt in it. This is a test for cystic fibrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; To look for cystic fibrosis, problems with the body's infection-fighting system (called the &quot;immune system&quot;), and other problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called a &quot;bronchoscopy&quot; &ndash; During this test, a doctor uses a thin tube (called a &quot;bronchoscope&quot;) to look at the airways inside the lungs. It can help find an object stuck in the airway or take samples of mucus from the lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to learn how well your child's lungs are working (&quot;pulmonary function tests&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to check for swallowing problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71624524\"><span class=\"h1\">How is bronchiectasis in children treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removal of anything stuck in the airway</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antibiotic medicines to help treat or prevent infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines to thin out mucus or moisten the airways (for children with cystic fibrosis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines to help open up the airways or reduce inflammation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway clearance therapy &ndash; This involves loosening the mucus in the lungs so your child can cough it up more easily. It is sometimes called &quot;chest physiotherapy.&quot; Your child's doctor, nurse, or therapist can show you different ways to do this.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; In some cases, removing part of a lung will help stop symptoms or infections.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71624539\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to help my child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your home and car smoke-free and keep your child away from smoke in other places.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure your child gets all his or her vaccines, including the pneumonia vaccine and the flu vaccine.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help your child get the nutrients he or she needs. This can help lungs work better.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get treatment right away if your child gets an infection. This can help prevent worse problems.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71624554\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Aspiration pneumonia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coughing-up-blood-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coughing up blood (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cystic fibrosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-risks-to-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Secondhand smoke: Risks to children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-symptoms-and-diagnosis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma symptoms and diagnosis in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Flexible bronchoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
