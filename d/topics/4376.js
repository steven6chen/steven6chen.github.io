The pathogenesis of long-term vascular sequelae including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease begins in childhood, although clinical manifestations of these complications are uncommon before adulthood. Vascular complications and mortality during adulthood are discussed in a separate topic review.

Severe and recurrent hypoglycemia can lead to acute and permanent neurologic complications. The symptoms, risk factors, treatment and complications of hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with T1DM are discussed in a separate topic review.

If insulin deficiency is severe and not adequately treated with additional insulin, increasing hyperglycemia and lipid breakdown occur, with production and accumulation of ketoacids, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). </p><p>DKA is a common and potentially fatal complication of T1DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It can be present at the initial presentation of T1DM or can occur in a patient with known diabetes. Frequent blood glucose testing or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) helps avoid this complication. The presentation, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of DKA are discussed separately.

Most children with T1DM grow normally. However, poor glycemic control can result in poor linear growth, poor weight gain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed skeletal and pubertal development. Conversely, treatment with excessive insulin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessive caloric intake can lead to excessive weight gain. If obesity develops, this can lead to insulin resistance, which complicates diabetes management.

Catch-up growth generally occurs if diabetic control is restored. However, individuals who are quickly restored to euglycemia may have a paradoxical worsening of retinopathy and should be followed closely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children and adolescents with T1DM are at increased risk for developing other autoimmune diseases, most commonly autoimmune thyroiditis and celiac disease.

The highest rate of depression occurs in the first year after diagnosis and in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Adolescent girls are at greater risk than adolescent boys for recurrent episodes of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Furthermore, insulin-dependent diabetes was a risk factor for attempted suicide in a study using a Danish registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Depression in patients with diabetes is associated with worse glycemic control and diabetic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. As an example, in a study of 2672 diabetic adolescents, most of whom had T1DM, the overall prevalence of depression was 22.6 percent and was moderate to severe in 8.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Depression was associated with higher glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels and increased frequency of emergency department visits.</p><p>Accordingly, comprehensive management of diabetes that addresses the psychological impact of diabetes in children and adolescents can improve glycemic control and reduce the frequency of hospitalizations even in the high-risk adolescent. As examples, in two controlled studies, structured psychoeducational support significantly improved glycemic control and reduced hospital admission rate in adolescents who had previously been poorly controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Similarly, in a systematic review of 543 children and adolescents with T1DM, psychological therapy significantly improved A1C levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Psychological intervention included counseling, cognitive behavior therapy, family systems therapy, and psychodynamic therapy.</p><p>Because depression occurs commonly in adolescents with diabetes and psychological intervention can improve care, an assessment for depression should be performed at least annually for all children and adolescents, as recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. This is especially important for children and adolescents who are not adhering to the diabetes management regimen. Those with symptoms of depression or positive depression screening should be further evaluated by a skilled mental health worker and intervention initiated, if appropriate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Eating disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adolescent girls with T1DM are more likely to develop an eating disorder compared with girls without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. Eating disorders consist of weight control practices such as fasting, self-induced vomiting (bulimia), diuretic abuse, as well as the purposeful omission of insulin for weight loss (sometimes known as &quot;diabulimia&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In one observational report, adolescent girls (age range 12 to 19 years) with T1DM were 2.4 times more likely to develop a clinical eating disorder and 1.9 times more likely to have a subclinical eating disorder than those without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Patients with T1DM and eating disorders have poorer metabolic control, require more frequent hospitalization, and are more likely to develop microvascular complications as compared with those without eating disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

Subclinical findings of vascular disease can be detected in a significant number of children and adolescents with diabetes. For example, increased vascular stiffness is seen in children with T1DM (particularly males) compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The risk of vascular disease depends on the duration of diabetes, degree of glycemic control, genetic susceptibility, pubertal status, gender, and other lifestyle factors (eg, smoking, diet, and exercise) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Exercise has a protective effect, in that it is associated with decreased early markers of atherosclerosis in children with T1DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism by which poor glycemic control predisposes to vascular disease is incompletely understood.

If not treated successfully, moderately increased albuminuria may progress to overt proteinuria (formerly known as macroalbuminuria), defined as persistent albumin excretion &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (&gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/minute)</span>.</p><p>Rates of diabetic nephropathy have decreased during the past decades in several populations, coinciding with improved glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Nonetheless, albuminuria develops in a substantial proportion of individuals with T1DM and is associated with longer duration of diabetes and poor glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/37-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-42</a>]. As an example, in a large population-based study, the cumulative prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria was 26 percent after 10 years of diabetes and 51 percent after 19 years of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Glycemic control, as measured by mean glycated hemoglobin (A1C) concentrations, was a strong predictor of the risk for albuminuria. However, the risk of developing albuminuria by age 20 was approximately 15 percent, even in patients with mean A1C levels &lt;8.5 percent. Overt proteinuria eventually developed in 14 percent of the subjects, at a mean age of 18.5 years. In a separate study with long-term follow-up, 88 percent of patients had developed moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria), and 72 percent had developed overt proteinuria (macroalbuminuria), by 50 years of T1DM duration, and 60 percent had progressed to end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Screening for albuminuria permits detection and treatment at a time when therapy can reverse, retard, or prevent further progression of renal disease (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> below). With treatment, moderately increased albuminuria can be reversed and further progression of renal disease halted. As nephropathy progresses to overt proteinuria, irreversible damage occurs and there is an increased risk of end-stage renal failure. The prognosis of diabetic nephropathy has dramatically improved with better glycemic control, more aggressive antihypertensive therapy, and the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Smoking considerably increases the risk of progression of microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In addition, hypertension increases the risk and severity of nephropathy. Studies conflict as to whether earlier age of onset of diabetes affects the rate of progression to diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/36,42,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,42,45,46</a>].

More frequent testing should be performed if the albumin to creatinine ratio is increasing.

Abnormal results (&gt;30 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">albumin/g</span> creatinine [&gt;3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol])</span> should be confirmed with a second random sample because transient elevations in urinary albumin excretion are common in pediatric patients, particularly in association with exercise or fever.

If the <span class=\"nowrap\">albumin/creatinine</span> ratio is persistently elevated, moderately increased albuminuria is likely; in this case, some would suggest confirmation of albuminuria with a twelve-hour overnight or 24-hour urine sample. However, in general, an elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">albumin/creatinine</span> ratio on two occasions, which is not a result of orthostatic albuminuria, should be sufficient to trigger treatment with an ACE inhibitor.
