The first human lung transplant procedure was performed in 1963, and the recipient survived 18 days, ultimately succumbing to renal failure and malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Despite the outcome, this demonstrated that lung transplantation was technically feasible and that rejection could be averted with the available immunosuppressive agents, at least for a short time.</p><p>Over the ensuing 15 years, few lung transplant procedures were performed, and the majority of recipients died perioperatively because of bronchial anastomotic complications. However, in 1981, the first successful heart-lung transplantation was performed for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This was followed in 1983 by the first successful single lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and in 1986 by the first double lung transplantation for emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These successes were attributed to improved surgical techniques and the advent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. Over the following several years, the number of lung transplant procedures performed rapidly increased, and the operation became an accepted treatment for end-stage lung disease.</p><p>An overview of lung transplantation, including a discussion of outcomes, is presented here. Lung transplantation indications, recipient selection, choice of procedure, post-operative management and complications are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: General guidelines for recipient selection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Disease-based choice of procedure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Procedure and postoperative management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninfectious-complications-following-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninfectious complications following lung transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of acute lung transplant rejection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 1993 and 2000, the number of transplants reported to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Registry increased modestly as activity appeared to plateau around 1900 procedures annually (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71574\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71574 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, there has been a steady growth in the number of procedures performed annually since 2000, and 4122 adult lung transplants were reported in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. While part of this increase may be attributable to greater participation in the ISHLT Registry, the rapid rise in activity since 2005 suggests that the lung allocation system implemented in the US in 2005 has increased the number of transplants performed.</p><p>Donor lung shortage has been the major limiting factor to the number of transplants performed. Lung organ procurement rates from deceased donors have consistently been substantially lower than kidney, liver, and heart procurement rates. Lungs are harvested from only 15 percent of all cadaveric donors, whereas kidneys and livers are harvested from 88 percent and hearts from 30 percent of deceased donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These disparities are likely due to the lung's vulnerability to potential complications that often arise before and after donor brain death such as thoracic trauma, aspiration, ventilator associated lung injury, pneumonia, and neurogenic pulmonary edema. Nonetheless, as many as 40 percent of rejected donor lungs may have been suitable for transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, studies suggest that ex vivo lung perfusion and reconditioning may ameliorate lung injury in some cases and allow transplantation from donors previously deemed unsuitable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Standard and extended criteria for donor lung selection and their impact on short and long-term outcomes are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Donor lung preservation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the early years, single lung transplantation was more frequent than bilateral transplantation. But, while the number of single lung transplants performed annually has remained stable, the number of bilateral transplants has consistently increased and surpassed the number of single lung procedures in 2002 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71574\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71574 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The choice of procedure and recipient selection are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: General guidelines for recipient selection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Disease-based choice of procedure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common diseases that lead to lung transplant are interstitial lung disease (including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61485\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61485 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Disease-based choice of procedure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ORGANIZATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transplant organizations and organ allocation policies are influenced by medical, ethical, geographical, and political factors and systems vary from country to country. In the United States, there are three main components of the transplant system: the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the organ procurement organizations (OPOs), and the transplant centers. Their different responsibilities are reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">United Network for Organ Sharing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UNOS is a private, non-profit organization that operates the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) under a contract with the US Department of Health and Human Services. UNOS develops policies that govern the transplant system with the goal of maximizing the efficient and equitable use of organs. In addition, UNOS maintains data pertaining to the waiting list, organ matching, and transplants. All OPOs and transplant centers must be members of UNOS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Organ procurement organizations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OPOs are private, non-profit organizations that recover organs within their geographical territory and allocate them based on UNOS guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung transplant centers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transplant centers are the focal point of the transplant system for patients and clinicians. In the United States, many health plans have preferred provider provisions for lung transplantation, and Medicare will only cover the procedure at approved centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">LUNG ALLOCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since May 2005, the order of patients on the waiting list for lung transplantation has been based on a Lung Allocation Score (LAS) that was developed to address high waiting list mortality and progressively earlier placement of patients on the waiting list [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. Under this system, a waiting list urgency measure (expected number of days lived without a transplant during an additional year on the waitlist) and a post-transplant survival measure (expected number of days lived during the first year post-transplant) are calculated using an individual candidate's clinical and physiological characteristics and the statistical models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The transplant urgency measure is subtracted from the transplant benefit measure to give a raw score, which is normalized to a continuous scale from 0 to 100, giving the final Lung Allocation Score. Higher scores represent higher urgency and greater potential transplant benefit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59818 \">table 1</a>). Candidates age 0 to 11 are assigned priority based on waiting time.</p><p>In the years following implementation of the LAS system, wait-list times decreased and the mean LAS score of transplant recipients increased, consistent with a greater urgency for transplantation; the total number of patients transplanted also increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. While wait-list mortality initially decreased after implementation of the LAS system, it has increased over the past several years and remains highest for patients with interstitial lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This finding has been attributed to listing increasingly sick patients as evidenced by the increase in the median LAS score over time and the limited donor pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>While the overall one-year survival after transplantation has not changed compared to the era before the LAS system was implemented, recipients with very high LAS scores at transplantation have a significantly higher 90-day and one-year mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. In a study of over 17,000 adult lung transplant recipients, survival beyond one year in the LAS era was worse than in the four-year period that preceded implementation of the LAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL FOR TRANSPLANT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with untreatable, advanced stage lung disease are referred to regional transplant centers for evaluation. Transplant centers typically screen the medical records of referred patients before an on-site evaluation is scheduled. The transplant centers thoroughly evaluate patients to determine the appropriateness of placing them on the transplant waiting list and to collect the information from which the Lung Allocation Score is derived. The patient is registered with UNOS and the patient's profile is updated at intervals, usually every six months.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When donor organs become available, the procuring organization contacts UNOS' national transplant communications center, UNet, by telephone or internet access. The UNet computer system runs <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/recipient</span> matches based on blood type, size of the organ, and distance between the donor and recipient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>UNOS then communicates the ranked match results to the OPOs to contact the transplant centers of the highest ranked patient. Once the organ is accepted, the OPO makes transportation arrangements and the transplant surgery is scheduled.</p><p/><p>Specifics of donor and recipient lung evaluation, selection, and management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: General guidelines for recipient selection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Deceased donor evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The type of transplant procedure and postoperative management are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Disease-based choice of procedure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Procedure and postoperative management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcome after lung transplantation can be assessed based on several different criteria: survival, quality of life, physiologic changes, and cost benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>]. Survival is perhaps the most straight forward assessment of outcome, and large registries can easily generate actuarial survival estimates based on multi-center and international data. However, other endpoints such as quality of life offer important insights into the benefits of lung transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has maintained a registry that has accrued data on more than 53,000 recipients from over a hundred transplant centers worldwide. The Registry has generated survival estimates from these data annually that have become a benchmark for the field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>According to the 2017 registry report, the median survival for all adult recipients is 6.0 years, but bilateral lung recipients appear to have a better median survival than single lung recipients (7.4 versus 4.6 years, respectively; a figure showing updated information, please see the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation slide set &quot;Overall Lung and Adult Lung Transplantation Statistics,&quot; slide titled Adult Lung Transplantation Kaplan-Meier Survival at: <a href=\"http://www.ishlt.org/registries/slides.asp?slides=heartLungRegistry&amp;token=x3djU/gR9hjQlMCTrO0sVuK+SR0v2blvAp6zVM7beggKVWo4WlskTJV/fKqLGVmCuVZY36WMXAe/yMaGWJ57csJYVToTbRWlU2Mp2R66kFg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4659\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ISHLT Registry</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>However, it is unclear if this survival advantage is directly related to the choice of operation or to the underlying recipient characteristics that influence this choice. A study that evaluated the impact of recipient age and operation performed on the survival of recipients with pulmonary fibrosis, found that single lung recipients younger than 60 years of age had a survival advantage over bilateral recipients in the same age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The impact of underlying diagnosis on survival after transplantation has been evaluated extensively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57297\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57297 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/5,17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17,22</a>]. The underlying diagnosis is often linked to age. In addition, certain diagnoses carry higher risks of operative complications and primary graft dysfunction. Nonetheless, recipients with COPD have the best one-year survival, but a lower ten-year survival compared to those with cystic fibrosis (CF), idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, sarcoidosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Recipients with IPAH have the lowest one-year survival, but their ten-year survival approaches those with CF and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Lastly, those with interstitial lung disease have a lower ten-year survival compared to others.</p><p>The Registry has also reported that one-year survival between the years 2000 and 2009 was significantly better than the two previous eras (1988 to 1994 and 1995 to 1999) (For a figure showing updated information, please see the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation slide set &quot;Overall Lung and Adult Lung Transplantation Statistics,&quot; slide titled Adult Lung Transplantation Kaplan-Meier Survival by Era [Transplants: January 1988-June 2009] at: <a href=\"http://www.ishlt.org/registries/slides.asp?slides=heartLungRegistry&amp;token=x3djU/gR9hjQlMCTrO0sVuK+SR0v2blvAp6zVM7beggKVWo4WlskTJV/fKqLGVmCuVZY36WMXAe/yMaGWJ57csJYVToTbRWlU2Mp2R66kFg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4659\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ISHLT Registry</a>). However, the improvement in survival between these time periods is less notable at five years, suggesting that management strategies have been more effective at reducing early complications than later ones, possibly due to refinements in surgical techniques and postoperative care. In contrast, survival beyond the first year is primarily affected by chronic rejection and infections, and the incidence of these complications has not changed substantially since 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes of death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary graft dysfunction (PGD), a form of <span class=\"nowrap\">ARDS/diffuse</span> alveolar damage (DAD), which occurs in the early hours to days after transplant, is the leading cause of death in the first 30 days after transplantation, accounting for more than 25 percent of deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/5,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25</a>]. The incidence of PGD has varied depending on the definition used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

In addition, a PGD score of 3 at any time in the first 48 hours correlated with increased short and long-term mortality. Furthermore, PGD has been identified as a significant independent risk factor for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), which is a leading cause of late mortality after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. </p><p>Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), which manifests as BOS or restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS), is the leading cause of mortality after the first year, accounting for over 20 to 30 percent of deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This remains the primary obstacle to better long-term outcomes after lung transplantation. The incidence of BOS approaches 50 percent within five years of transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/23,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,32,33</a>]. Survival three years after the onset of BOS is only 50 percent, and drops to 30 to 40 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Superimposed infections and malignancies due to immunosuppressive therapy often further complicate the course. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infectious complications remain a leading cause of death at all time points after lung transplantation, accounting for 35 percent of deaths in the first year and 20 percent of deaths thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Bacterial bronchitis and pneumonia are most common, but fungi, cytomegalovirus, community acquired respiratory viruses, and mycobacteria all contribute to the overall burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial infections following lung transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in lung transplant recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Malignancy accounts for a small percentage of mortality in the first year after transplantation; beyond the first year, 7 to 10 percent of all deaths are due to cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is the most prevalent malignancy overall, but posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is the most common malignancy in the first year after transplant and second most common overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Other malignancies include colon and breast cancer. A study from Israel found an increased incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (4 percent each) in addition to non-melanotic skin cancer and PTLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Furthermore, multiple studies have documented improved overall and health-related quality of life after lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>]. One study showed comparable health-related quality of life results between lung transplant recipients and a normative sample of healthy people, with the exception of the social functioning domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Postoperative complications hamper this improvement in quality of life. Recipients who have developed BOS report more physical restrictions and depressive and anxiety symptoms than those who have not and have decrements in health-related quality of life compared to their pre-BOS evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/42,43,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43,45</a>]. Similarly, infections and episodes of acute rejection have a negative impact on health-related quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Nonetheless, even if the survival advantage itself is modest, the prospect of improving quality of life and quality-adjusted survival is often the motivation for transplantation for many recipients and almost 90 percent of survivors are satisfied with their decision to have a transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2810122726\"><span class=\"h2\">Retransplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retransplantation among lung transplant recipients is infrequent and accounts for approximately 4 percent of lung transplant procedures.

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of lung transplantations performed at one center between May 2005 and June 2009, median charges for the transplantation admission were $153,995 for patients with lung allocation scores (LAS) in the three lower quartiles, compared with $276,668 for those with LAS scores in the highest quartile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, no difference between the LAS quartiles was noted in the charges for the first year, when the transplantation admission charges were excluded. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that examined the index hospitalization charges of patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) between 2000 and 2011, median charges for lung transplant recipients who required ECMO were US$780,391 compared with US$324,279 for those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p>Wage effects are not included in the cost-effectiveness analysis in most studies, and if recipients returned to work, this would be an obvious asset. Employment patterns did not change after transplantation in the only study that specifically addressed this issue, and only 38 percent of the recipients felt that they were able to work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract/23,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

The proportion of bilateral lung transplants has increased and surpassed that of single lung transplants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71574\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71574 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common diseases that lead to lung transplant are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD), cystic fibrosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61485\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61485 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Responsibility for recipient evaluation, waiting list management, and matching of donor organs with recipients is shared by three organizations: United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs), and lung transplant centers. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Organizations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung allocation to patients on the waiting list has been based on a &quot;Lung Allocation Score&quot; since May 2005. This score includes a measure urgency of need for transplant and a post transplant likelihood of survival measure. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Lung allocation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) and infections are the major causes of death in the first year post transplant; chronic graft dysfunction due to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is the major cause of death after the first year. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-lung-graft-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary lung graft dysfunction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The underlying lung disease influences mortality post transplant: first year mortality is lowest for COPD and highest for IPAH. In contrast, mortality at 10 years is highest for COPD and IPF and lowest for cystic fibrosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57297\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57297 \">figure 3</a>).
