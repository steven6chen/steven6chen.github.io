Varicella infection in children is generally a mild disease, while infection in adults can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. During pregnancy, varicella pneumonia can be particularly severe and maternal infection can lead to congenital abnormalities with devastating consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will address the epidemiology, infectious complications, management and prevention of varicella in the pregnant female. The clinical manifestations, treatment and prevention of VZV infection in the nonpregnant adult are discussed elsewhere.

Thus, pregnant women are at risk for substantial morbidity and mortality. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the mother acquires varicella infection during the early gestational period (weeks 8 to 20), the fetus is at risk for developing congenital varicella syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This syndrome is characterized by limb hypoplasia, skin lesions, neurologic abnormalities, and structural eye damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

This low incidence is related to the high rates of VZV seropositivity among adults (&gt;95 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8</a>]. Similar rates have been demonstrated in Europe, but VZV seropositivity rates among persons living in tropical areas are lower, at approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>Although the incidence of varicella is not higher in pregnant compared to nonpregnant adults, disease severity appears to be increased. Varicella pneumonia is often estimated to complicate 10 to 20 percent of maternal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, in a study of 935 cases of maternal VZV infection identified from a large database of hospital admissions in the United States, a VZV pneumonia diagnosis was recorded in only 2.5 percent, and there were no deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other estimates of morbidity and mortality related to varicella pneumonia have been higher, at 3 to 14 percent in the era of antiviral treatment, down from 20 to 45 percent prior to the introduction of effective antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,13</a>].

Fewer than 2 percent of women who have acquired varicella infection during the first 20 weeks of gestation have subsequently given birth to an infant with this embryopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/3,4,14,15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,14,15,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest published prospective study of 1739 cases of maternal varicella infection, the incidence of congenital abnormalities was 0.4 percent if maternal infection occurred before the 12th week of pregnancy; the risk increased to approximately two percent if maternal infection occurred between weeks 13 and 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 362 women with maternal VZV infection (347 with varicella; 15 with zoster), only one female with varicella infection gave birth to an infant with VZV embryopathy (0.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only nine isolated cases of congenital varicella have been reported between weeks 21 to 28 of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p>In the largest published prospective study of maternal varicella, there were 344 cases of herpes zoster and there were no cases of congenital varicella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, there is one case report from 1987 of congenital varicella syndrome following maternal zoster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H234536\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of varicella vaccine on VZV epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of varicella has changed over time since the introduction of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> in 1995. High immunization rates with one dose of varicella vaccine led to an 84 percent reduction in the number of varicella cases in the United States and an 88 percent decline in varicella-related hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Despite these improvements, varicella-related infections and breakthrough varicella disease were reported, leading to the initiation of a two-dose schedule in 2006. The vaccine efficacy of two doses over a 10-year observation period is estimated at 98 percent for the prevention of any infection and 100 percent for the prevention of severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>A US-based survey demonstrated that the incidence of varicella infections among adults has declined by 74 percent in the decade following the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Since only 3 percent of the adults surveyed had been vaccinated, the substantial decline of infections was attributed to herd immunity. Although the incidence data showed a positive impact of immunization, adults who developed varicella were at higher risk of morbidity and mortality compared with children. </p><p>Epidemiologic data also suggest that varicella vaccination has reduced the number of maternal and fetal varicella infections. As an example, surveillance data from Australia from 2006 to 2009 demonstrated that the incidence of congenital varicella infection was 0.19 per 100,000 live <span class=\"nowrap\">births/annum</span> and the incidence of neonatal infection was 2 per 100,000 live <span class=\"nowrap\">births/annum</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These trends represent an 85 percent reduction in varicella cases among newborns in the post-vaccination era compared to the prevaccination era. </p><p>No long-term data are available on the duration of protection of the two-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> schedule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2091920\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the risk of transmission of VZV infection is higher with exposure to varicella compared with zoster.

(See <a href=\"#H234396\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of varicella is low among adults because most are immune to infection. Although the incidence of varicella is not increased in pregnant compared with nonpregnant adults, disease severity appears to be higher during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H2091906\" class=\"local\">'Maternal varicella'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among women who develop varicella infection during pregnancy, the risk of congenital varicella syndrome appears to be small (0.4 to 2 percent). (See <a href=\"#H2091913\" class=\"local\">'Congenital varicella'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Varicella is highly communicable, with secondary attack rates in susceptible household contacts approaching 90 percent in the prevaccination era. Patients are infectious from one to two days prior to this rash until lesions are crusted over. Mother-to-child transmission of VZV can occur in utero, perinatally, or postnatally. (See <a href=\"#H2091920\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vesicular rash of varicella appears in successive crops over several days on the face, trunk and extremities. (See <a href=\"#H2092264\" class=\"local\">'Uncomplicated varicella'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the most common maternal clinical manifestations of complicated varicella infection in pregnancy is varicella pneumonia. The clinical course is unpredictable and may rapidly progress to hypoxia and respiratory failure, with high rates of mortality in untreated infection. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of maternal VZV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital varicella syndrome is characterized by cutaneous scars, intrauterine growth retardation, and neurological, ocular and limb abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Fetal effects of VZV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of maternal varicella infection is clinical, based on the characteristic vesicular rash. (See <a href=\"#H1098780\" class=\"local\">'Maternal varicella'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After maternal infection, the risk of congenital varicella syndrome can be estimated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of fetal blood or amniotic fluid for VZV DNA, in conjunction with ultrasonography for detection of structural fetal abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H1098827\" class=\"local\">'Congenital varicella syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiviral therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> in nonpregnant adults improves skin healing and the duration of fever, if initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset. There are no data to suggest that acyclovir prevents the development of complicated infection. A large prospective registry of acyclovir-exposed pregnancies suggests that acyclovir is not teratogenic, although large controlled trials have not been performed. We suggest oral acyclovir for pregnant women with uncomplicated varicella (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management of maternal VZV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there are no direct controlled trials in nonpregnant or pregnant adults, mortality rates secondary to varicella pneumonia appear significantly lower with treatment compared with untreated historical controls. We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> for all pregnant women with varicella pneumonia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Acyclovir should be administered intravenously at 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every eight hours in patients with complicated varicella infection. (See <a href=\"#H259849\" class=\"local\">'Varicella pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postexposure prophylaxis is targeted to susceptible pregnant women (eg, those without a history of varicella or those who are seronegative) who have had a significant exposure to a person with varicella or zoster. Since many women have serologic evidence of past infection, it appears cost-effective to serologically screen prior to prophylaxis, when feasible. (See <a href=\"#H3722805\" class=\"local\">'Evaluating susceptibility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoprophylaxis (eg, VariZIG) is associated with a lower risk of acquisition of varicella after exposure and milder illness in those who seroconvert despite postexposure prophylaxis. Persons who undergo immunoprophylaxis need careful follow-up for symptoms of varicella infection. (See <a href=\"#H234335\" class=\"local\">'Immunoprophylaxis for the prevention of maternal varicella infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend postexposure prophylaxis with an immunoglobulin product containing high titers of VZV-specific antibodies compared with watchful waiting (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In the United States, VariZIG is the only available product with VZV-specific antibodies. Administration of VariZIG should occur within 10 days of exposure. (See <a href=\"#H260146\" class=\"local\">'VariZIG'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persons who undergo immunoprophylaxis need careful follow-up for symptoms of varicella infection. (See <a href=\"#H234335\" class=\"local\">'Immunoprophylaxis for the prevention of maternal varicella infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The negative effects of varicella infection on maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality are preventable with varicella immunization prior to onset of pregnancy. The safety and efficacy of varicella vaccination is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H1098198\" class=\"local\">'Pre-exposure prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-chickenpox-primary-varicella-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaccination for the prevention of chickenpox (primary varicella infection)&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lamont RF, Sobel JD, Carrington D, et al.
