Historically, studies defining the epidemiology and clinical virology of CRVs in lung transplant recipients have been retrospective, have involved inpatients only, and have used culture-based diagnostic techniques in patients with severe respiratory symptoms. As a result, these studies may underestimate the incidence and overestimate the severity of CRVs in lung transplant recipients. A few more contemporary studies have used molecular techniques applied prospectively to all lung transplant recipients, including outpatients and asymptomatic individuals; these studies are summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59838 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>].</p><p>Our understanding of CRVs in lung transplant recipients has improved over time. Nonetheless, there are several significant gaps in our knowledge that warrant further investigation. Additional prospective studies carried out over several years and in different geographic regions are needed to best define the epidemiology and clinical impact of CRVs in lung transplant recipients. Such studies should include both healthy outpatients and those with clinical disease and should be correlated with clinical course and pulmonary function testing. These studies would ideally use a broad array of molecular diagnostic tests to identify the widest range of viruses. In patients with documented infection, serial monitoring using quantitative molecular testing should be performed to define the natural history of the CRVs in this population. In addition, studies of available and investigational antiviral agents are needed to define the optimal antiviral regimen, dosing, and duration of therapy as well as the impact of therapy on secondary infections and on the development of acute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic rejection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H231754831\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the lung's exposure to the environment, inhaled viruses are of particular concern and can be divided into pathogens that primarily affect the respiratory tract (CRVs, such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus) and pathogens that predominantly affect other tissues (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV], varicella-zoster virus [VZV], herpes simplex virus [HSV], measles). Adenovirus can be either a primary respiratory pathogen or the lungs can be involved as part of a disseminated infection.</p><p>The incidence of disease with CRVs varies in individual patient populations, depending in part on the incidence of disease in different geographic regions. Children tend to have more CRV infections than adults.</p><p>The epidemiology of individual viral infections is discussed in greater detail separately.

Risk factors for progression to lower tract disease or severe illness among lung transplant recipients include being a child, having received recent lymphodepletion or treatment for rejection, and having had early post-transplant infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1754194724\"><span class=\"h3\">Seasonal patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The seasonal patterns of the individual CRVs in lung transplant recipients are similar to those seen in immunocompetent hosts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outbreaks of influenza generally occur during the winter months in the northern and southern hemispheres (which occur at different times of year). In the temperate northern hemisphere, influenza predominates from November through April with variable peaks that typically occur in January or February (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60877\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60877 \">figure 1</a>). In tropical regions, influenza occurs throughout the year.

There are no pathognomonic signs or symptoms associated with a single CRV, and there is almost always co-circulation of multiple viral pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It is therefore impossible to determine the etiology on clinical grounds alone, and respiratory samples must be tested to make a definitive virologic diagnosis, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1754194981\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Signs and symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract infections caused by CRVs are often muted in lung transplant recipients because the inflammatory response is impaired by immunosuppressive therapy. Most lung transplant recipients with viral upper respiratory tract infections present with respiratory complaints or objective changes in pulmonary function test (PFT) results compared with baseline values. Rarely, isolated changes in PFTs are the only sign of infection.

CRVs may cause local mucosal defects and changes in cell surface peptides, which in turn may predispose to colonization and local invasion of colonizing fungi and bacteria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2809662001\"><span class=\"h3\">Rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transplanted lungs are susceptible to several different types of rejection. These include acute cellular rejection, humoral rejection, and chronic lung allograft dysfunction. There are two types of chronic lung allograft dysfunction, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and restrictive allograft syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans#H5794767\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>CRVs, particularly when associated with lower respiratory tract involvement, may be associated with rejection, the most common type of which is chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), previously referred to a bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/8,12,19-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,19-30</a>]. While the link between CRVs and CLAD is strong, the link between CRVs and acute rejection is less clear; most later studies have not demonstrated a correlation. Lymphocytic infiltrates are the expected response to viral infections and likely the reason that rejection has been diagnosed in some patients with CRV infection.</p><p>CLAD has been associated with several CRVs, particularly when the virus involves the lower respiratory tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/1,19-26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19-26,29</a>]. Lower respiratory tract CRV infection causes local mucosal damage, exposing the host to alloantigen. There is at least one animal model that has demonstrated a correlation between lower tract infection with Sendai virus, a virus related to parainfluenza virus (PIV), and chronic lung allograft dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study that included 250 lung transplant recipients, 50 (20 percent) were diagnosed with chronic lung allograft dysfunction and 79 (32 percent) had 114 episodes of CRV infection; most CRV infections were lower respiratory tract infections (85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. On multivariate analysis, rejection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.9) and CRV infection (aHR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.5) were independently associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction. The association of CRV infection with chronic lung allograft dysfunction was stronger the more proximate the CRV infection (aHRs 4.8, 3.4, and 2.4 for 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months following CRV infection, respectively).</p><p>In a separate study of 139 lung transplant recipients that prospectively monitored CRV infections, the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction was increased among those with CRV pneumonia (HR 3.94, 95% CI 1.97-7.90), but not symptomatic CRV infection or asymptomatic CRV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The risk of graft loss was not increased by asymptomatic or symptomatic CRV infection. </p><p>The association between CRVs and acute rejection has not been established, with studies showing conflicting results. One reason that it has been difficult to evaluate this potential association is that the cellular infiltrates observed in patients with CRVs may represent the host's appropriate response to the viral infection rather than rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Several prospective studies have failed to find an association between CRV infection and acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/17,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,32,33</a>]. On the other hand, one study reported a 33 percent acute rejection rate in patients who had had a CRV infection within the past three months compared with 7 percent of those who did not have a recent CRV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A limitation of this study is that the patients considered to have acute rejection included not only those with grade &ge;2 biopsy-proven acute rejection but also those with a &ge;20 percent decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), which could be caused by caused by conditions other than acute rejection. No significant difference was seen in the incidence of acute rejection between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.</p><p>Cytomegalovirus has also been associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction. This is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients#H709588855\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in lung transplant recipients&quot;, section on 'Indirect effects'</a>.)</p><p>Other viruses, such as human herpes virus 6 and Epstein-Barr virus have been associated with an increased risk of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in some but not all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>Rejection in lung transplant recipients is discussed in detail separately.

In lung transplant recipients with mild to moderate respiratory illness, we start by obtaining nasopharyngeal samples (swabs or washings) for CRV testing. Available tests and techniques vary by institution. Some institutions use individual tests for each CRV, whereas others use a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test for a panel of CRVs. We typically test for influenza, parainfluenza virus, RSV, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus in lung transplant recipients presenting with a respiratory illness. We have a low threshold for repeating testing for certain CRVs (eg, influenza) if initial testing is negative but the virus is known to be circulating locally; this is particularly important if effective antiviral therapy is available.</p><p>In patients who have evidence of pneumonia and who are severely ill and in whom the diagnosis has not been made by less invasive techniques, we generally favor bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The following table lists various tests that can be performed on BAL fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70685\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70685 \">table 2</a>). The decision of which studies to perform depends upon the individual patient's epidemiologic exposures and clinical findings and on availability at specific hospital laboratories. When the diagnosis is not established by studies of BAL fluid or noninvasive testing, histopathology of lung tissue can be helpful.</p><p>The diagnosis of specific CRVs and community-acquired pneumonia is discussed in greater detail separately.

Molecular diagnostic techniques (eg, the polymerase chain reaction) are preferred. Nearly every study in immunocompromised patients, including those focusing on lung transplant recipients, has demonstrated that PCR provides greater yield and sensitivity than culture or direct florescent antibody (DFA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/2,5,6,12,19,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6,12,19,37,38</a>]. Similarly, several PCR methods are quantitative, which allows for serial monitoring of the clinical course and response to therapy.</p><p>Although rapid antigen detection systems have been developed for influenza, RSV, and adenovirus, their sensitivity is limited, particularly in immunocompromised adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/11,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,39</a>]; negative rapid antigen results should therefore <strong>never</strong> be used to rule out the presence of disease. If rapid antigen testing is used, positive results should guide therapy, whereas negative results should mandate additional testing.</p><p>Culture is insensitive for some viruses (eg, PIV, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus infections [hMPV]), and there are limited reagents to allow routine DFA testing for other viruses (eg, rhinovirus, coronavirus).</p><p>Some transplant centers routinely test for CRVs whenever a bronchoscopy is performed. However, the relevance of respiratory viruses detected from asymptomatic lung transplant recipients remains to be defined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1931378\"><span class=\"h3\">Specimen type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal specimens for CRV testing are nasopharyngeal aspirates, washings, and swabs.

In hospitalized patients with suspected CRV infection, specimens can be collected from different respiratory sites and on more than one day to increase the likelihood of detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In particular, in mechanically ventilated patients, upper (nasopharyngeal aspirates, washings, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swabs) and lower (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, endotracheal aspirates <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> washes) respiratory tract samples should be obtained if CRV infection is suspected but not yet confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe0903992&amp;token=qPRSykph7sfSN5jwrFloS0yqCfd5aJZXJsbZGboQoMUm52H917Ts9H4UHQHQtxcwFOW7xzGoGaiFvYLObq1u+w==&amp;TOPIC_ID=13952\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">video</a> reviews the proper technique for nasopharyngeal swab collection.</p><p>The optimal specimen type has been best studied for influenza infection.

We typically retest patients on the day that therapy is scheduled to end; if positive, therapy is extended an additional five days, at which point we retest again to inform the need for additional therapy. If the patient continues with prolonged symptoms and signs with shedding or has clinical deterioration with ongoing replication, antiviral drug resistance should be considered. When there is clinical concern for resistance, appropriate testing should be performed and alternative therapy considered.

In otherwise healthy immunocompetent adults and children, there is little benefit to the use of antivirals greater than 48 hours after symptom onset; this may not be the case with lung transplant recipients. Some studies have suggested that antiviral therapy reduces the severity and incidence of complications of influenza, the duration of hospitalization in patients with severe influenza, and influenza-associated mortality.

However, in the setting of significant influenza activity, we are most likely to give preexposure prophylaxis to those who underwent transplantation within the past month. The American Society of Transplantation states that, for lung transplant recipients in whom influenza vaccination is contraindicated or for those who are likely to have an inadequate response to the vaccine (eg, those receiving therapy for acute rejection or who underwent transplantation recently), preexposure antiviral prophylaxis for 12 weeks starting at the beginning of influenza season may be proposed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50350\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50350 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>In patients who meet criteria for preexposure prophylaxis described above but who are not receiving it and who have been exposed to a patient with influenza within the past 48 hours, the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends giving postexposure prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, we prefer to either give such patients treatment dosing for five days or to closely observe such patients for signs and symptoms of infection and initiate treatment if they develop. We are most likely to offer treatment to exposed patients who underwent transplant within the past month. Our rationale for avoiding postexposure prophylaxis in most patients is that it might lead to the development of resistance.

The author of this topic review agrees with this approach. However, it should be noted that some experts give supportive care only rather than antiviral therapy given the lack of clear evidence of benefit of antiviral therapy. Oral ribavirin is typically dosed at 600 to 800 mg twice daily. Duration is usually seven days or until clear improvement in symptoms.</p><p>There are limited observational data on the role of antiviral therapy in the management of RSV infection in lung transplant recipients.

Major drawbacks of aerosolized ribavirin include extremely high cost, intolerance, bronchospasm, and risk to the caretakers exposed to the therapy (because it is a teratogen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>It is not clear whether glucocorticoids are beneficial for the management of RSV, but they are frequently used in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> by transplant clinicians because it is difficult to distinguish infection from rejection on biopsy and both may coexist. One study of five RSV-infected lung transplant recipients treated with glucocorticoids and oral ribavirin (15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in three divided doses for a total of 10 days) concluded that the intervention was well-tolerated and less costly than aerosolized ribavirin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

Important viruses in lung transplant recipients include the community respiratory viruses (CRVs; eg, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). CMV infection in lung transplant recipients is covered in detail separately.

As an example, outbreaks of influenza generally occur during the winter months in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (which occur at different times of the year). In the temperate Northern Hemisphere, influenza predominates from November through April and typically peaks in February (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60877\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60877 \">figure 1</a>).

There are no pathognomonic signs or symptoms associated with a single CRV, and there is almost always co-circulation of multiple viral pathogens. It is therefore impossible to make a virologic diagnosis clinically, and respiratory samples must be tested to make a definitive virologic diagnosis.

(See <a href=\"#H2809662001\" class=\"local\">'Rejection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRVs should be considered and tested for in any lung transplant recipient presenting with fever and respiratory symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes in pulmonary function testing results. In lung transplant recipients with mild to moderate respiratory illness, we start by obtaining nasopharyngeal samples (swabs or washings) for CRVs. We favor molecular diagnostic techniques (eg, the polymerase chain reaction) and typically test for influenza, parainfluenza virus, RSV, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus. We have a low threshold for repeating testing for certain CRVs (eg, influenza) if initial testing is negative but the virus is known to be circulating locally; this is particularly important if effective antiviral therapy is available. (See <a href=\"#H231754927\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H231754985\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who have evidence of pneumonia and who are severely ill and in whom the diagnosis has not been made by less invasive techniques, we generally favor bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The following table lists various tests that can be performed on BAL fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70685\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70685 \">table 2</a>). The decision of which studies to send depends upon the individual patient's epidemiologic exposures and clinical findings and on availability at specific hospital laboratories. When the diagnosis is not established by studies of BAL fluid or noninvasive testing, histopathology of lung tissue can be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H231754927\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of CRVs varies with the specific virus causing the infection. Effective antiviral agents are available for certain CRVs (eg, influenza) but not for others. Among the CRVs, a vaccine is available only for influenza virus. The choice of agent for influenza infection is similar to that for immunocompetent hosts. We continue antiviral therapy in lung transplant recipients with influenza until shedding is no longer detected by the real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; this will typically require more than the five days of therapy recommended for immunocompetent individuals. The management of other CRVs is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H1754194759\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1664678105\" class=\"local\">'Therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Annual influenza vaccination should be given to all lung transplant recipients (after the early post-transplant period) and their close contacts. An <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> should be used in lung transplant recipients; the live attenuated intranasal vaccine is contraindicated. (See <a href=\"#H1112094335\" class=\"local\">'Vaccination'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For lung transplant recipients in whom influenza vaccination is contraindicated or for those who are likely to have an inadequate response to the vaccine (eg, those receiving therapy for acute rejection or who underwent transplantation recently), we suggest preexposure antiviral prophylaxis for 12 weeks starting at the beginning of influenza season (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50350\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50350 \">table 3</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We are most likely to give preexposure prophylaxis to those who underwent transplantation within the past month. In patients who meet criteria for preexposure prophylaxis but who are not receiving it, we give postexposure prophylaxis following exposure to a patient with influenza. Postexposure prophylaxis is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H749194986\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-seasonal-influenza-with-antiviral-drugs-in-adults#H155239410\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of seasonal influenza with antiviral drugs in adults&quot;, section on 'Postexposure prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The herpesviruses (eg, CMV, HSV, VZV) are important causes of infection in lung transplant recipients because they commonly reactivate in the setting of immunosuppression when prophylaxis is not used. Specific herpesvirus prophylaxis is effective at preventing these infections. (See <a href=\"#H1664679868\" class=\"local\">'Herpes viruses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> is used to prevent CMV reactivation in lung transplant recipients who are at risk. The prevention and treatment of CMV in lung transplant recipients are discussed in detail separately.

Appropriate regimens for HSV and VZV prophylaxis in patients with normal renal function include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> 400 to 800 mg orally twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> 500 mg orally twice daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a> 500 mg orally twice daily.
