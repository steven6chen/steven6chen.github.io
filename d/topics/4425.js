Endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy dramatically expand the imaging capabilities of flexible endoscopy by their ability to obtain &quot;optical biopsies&quot; of nearly any accessible endoluminal surface. </p><p>The examinations are carried out in vivo with real-time image display. The techniques have primarily been applied to the differentiation of colon polyps and for the detection of dysplasia and neoplasia in conditions such as Barrett's esophagus and ulcerative colitis. Since the first visible neoplastic changes in epithelial cancers occur at a cellular level, these imaging techniques may allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment. In addition, confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy may allow for targeted biopsies of abnormal mucosa, thereby decreasing the number of biopsies required to diagnose dysplasia or neoplasia while increasing diagnostic yield.</p><p>This topic will review confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy, including the technical aspects of the procedures, their indications, and efficacies. Chromoendoscopy, magnification endoscopy, optical coherence tomography, narrow band imaging, and autofluorescence endoscopy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chromoendoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chromoendoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnification-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnification endoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optical-coherence-tomography-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optical coherence tomography in the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Evaluation with narrow band imaging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-autofluorescence-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Evaluation with autofluorescence endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455771639\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL OVERVIEW</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455771646\"><span class=\"h2\">Confocal laser endomicroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is based upon the principle of illuminating a tissue with a low-power laser and then detecting fluorescent light reflected from the tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The laser is focused at a specific depth and only light reflected back from that plane is refocused and able to pass through the pinhole confocal aperture. As a result, scattered light from above and below the plane of interest is not detected, increasing spacial resolution. The area being examined is scanned in the horizontal and vertical planes and an image is reconstructed. In this manner, microscopic imaging of biological tissue in vivo is possible due to the high lateral resolution of confocal imaging.</p><p>Since CLE relies upon tissue fluorescence, intravenous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> topically applied contrast agents are required. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> is used to highlight the vasculature, lamina propria, and intracellular spaces of this tissue being examined. However, it does not stain cell nuclei. Nuclear staining can be achieved using topical contrast agents such as acriflavine and cresyl violet, but there is concern over mutagenic potential with the topical agents. (See <a href=\"#H4168208\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events'</a> below.)</p><p>The greatest challenge for CLE has been miniaturization and integration of the technology into endoscopic equipment. Two systems have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration: a tip-integrated confocal laser endomicroscope and a flexible fiber-based confocal miniprobe. Both systems contain a laser scanning unit and a PC-based image viewer for image acquisition and storage. Currently, only the confocal miniprobe is commercially available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455771653\"><span class=\"h3\">Confocal laser endomicroscope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscope-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (eCLE) uses a miniaturized confocal laser endomicroscope (Optiscan, Australia) that is integrated into the distal tip of a conventional endoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Currently, these confocal laser endomicroscopes with a tip-integrated solution are not commercially available. An eCLE scope can be used in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, but is too large to be used for biliary examinations. A single optical fiber acts as both the illumination point source and the detection pinhole. White-light endoscopy and eCLE are performed simultaneously with white-light and confocal images displayed side-by-side on separate monitors.</p><p>Confocal image data are collected at a scan rate of 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">frames/second</span> (1024 x 1024 pixels) or 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">frames/second</span> (1024 x 512 pixels). The optical slice thickness is 7 microns and the depth of scanning can vary from 0 to 250 microns. The field of view is 475 x 475 microns and the lateral resolution (ie, the minimum detectable separation between two interfaces) is 0.7 microns. The depth of imaging relative to the surface of the tissue is controlled using two additional buttons on the endoscope. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455771660\"><span class=\"h3\">Confocal miniprobe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A flexible probe-based system (Cellvizio, Mauna Kea Technologies, Paris, France) is an alternative to using a confocal laser endomicroscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE), both the laser scanning unit and light source are outside the body of the patient, making the confocal miniprobe a &quot;passive&quot; conduit. Multiple probes are available that vary with regard to field of view, depth of confocal plane, and lateral resolution. </p><p>The miniprobes are very flexible and can be passed through the working channel of a standard endoscope. Their diameters range from 0.9 to 2.5 mm. The probes can be disinfected and reused, but the number of uses is limited (approximately 20). Other accessories, such as a hood on the tip of an endoscope or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography accessories, may be helpful, but are not mandatory. (See <a href=\"#H17143174\" class=\"local\">'Maximizing image quality'</a> below.)</p><p>The 488 nm laser beam is transmitted via several thousand optical fibers within the probe. These same fibers return the reflected fluorescent light to a distal micro-objective. Confocal image data are collected at a frame rate of 12 frames per second that, unlike eCLE at 0.8 to 1.6 frames per second, enables video quality. Depending upon which probe is used, the field of view ranges from 240 x 240 microns to 600 x 500 microns, the lateral resolution ranges from 1 to 3.5 microns, and the depth of imaging ranges from 0 to 100 microns. While in eCLE the depth of imaging can be adjusted, in pCLE the depth of imaging depends upon the probe being used and is fixed. </p><p>An advantage of pCLE is that probes have been developed for biliary and pancreatic examinations. The Cholangioflex-probe has a diameter of 0.9 mm and can be passed through the instrumentation channel of a cholangioscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. During cholangioscopy, the probe can be placed against the lesion or area of interest under direct visual control and guidance. There are also reports of the probe being passed under fluoroscopic guidance using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The tip of the probe has a metallic ring and can be easily seen on fluoroscopy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholangioscopy-and-pancreatoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholangioscopy and pancreatoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-transhepatic-cholangioscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy&quot;</a>). With further miniaturization of the device, miniprobes can meanwhile be passed through a 19G-FNA needle, thereby enabling endoscopic ultrasound-guided CLE of solid organs, lymph nodes, and cystic lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455771667\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocytoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), endocytoscopy aims to enable real-time microscopic imaging of the mucosa in vivo. The main difference between CLE and endocytoscopy is that endocytoscopy is based solely on high-level magnification using optical lenses. Therefore, because there is no confocal plane, only the very superficial layer of the mucosa can be imaged. In addition, the lens must come into direct contact with the tissue being examined.</p><p>An endocytoscopy system is manufactured by Olympus (Tokyo, Japan). The system can be probe-based [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] or integrated within an endoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The probe-based system consists of two flexible catheters that provide surface magnification of 450- and 1125-fold with a 14-inch monitor or 570- and 1400-fold using a 19-inch monitor. </p><p>As with confocal endomicroscopy, acquisition of quality images requires application of a contrast agent. Typically, topical application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> or a combination of methylene blue with crystal violet is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. In epithelia that produce significant amounts of mucin (eg, gastric epithelium or Barrett's mucosa), imaging may be hampered by the contrast agent failing to penetrate the mucin barrier, resulting in inadequate staining. (See <a href=\"#H17143214\" class=\"local\">'Staining'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17143174\"><span class=\"h2\">Maximizing image quality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The keys to obtaining high-quality images are optimizing contrast administration, positioning, and stability. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17143214\"><span class=\"h3\">Staining</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Image quality following intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> administration is best within the first 10 minutes following contrast administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], though imaging may continue for 30 to 45 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. For examinations using topical contrast agents, it is essential to thoroughly remove the mucin layer prior to staining. This can be done by applying N-acetylcysteine or acetic acid, flushing with water, and then homogeneously staining the mucosa using a spraying catheter. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17143221\"><span class=\"h3\">Device placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To improve image quality, when possible, the probe or endoscope should be placed perpendicular to the mucosa rather than tangentially. The way the device is placed is also important in patients with friable lesions because blood causes visual interference. In such cases, the probe or endoscope should be carefully apposed to the mucosa to decrease tissue disruption. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17143314\"><span class=\"h3\">Stabilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Movements caused by the examiner or the patient (breathing or peristalsis) can impair positioning and cause artifacts. For probe-based examinations, attaching a clear plastic cap to the tip of the endoscope and applying gentle suction helps hold the probe in position. Such an approach can be particularly helpful when imaging Barrett's esophagus since probe placement in the distal esophagus can be challenging. In addition, using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> to sedate the patient helps to avoid retching, belching, and patient movement during the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternatives-and-adjuncts-to-moderate-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alternatives and adjuncts to moderate procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4168398\"><span class=\"h2\">Obtaining biopsies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eCLE scope has a regular working channel that is not occupied by a probe, and a biopsy can be taken from the same area. On the other hand, with pCLE systems the miniprobes occupy the working channel of the endoscope, so biopsies can only be obtained after the probe is removed. This limitation can be overcome by creating a suction polyp that contains the area of interest. In the case of cholangioscopy, after the lesion or area of interest has been examined, the probe is removed and a biopsy forceps is passed through the biopsy channel of the cholangioscope. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455771674\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) and endocytoscopy are still being defined. In general, these procedures are used to target biopsies of abnormal tissue and decrease biopsies of normal tissue. The goal is to increase diagnostic yield, while minimizing procedure-related risks of tissue acquisition. A potential indication that has not yet been evaluated is using &quot;optical biopsies&quot; with these techniques instead of conventional histology in patients at high risk for procedure-associated bleeding.

This may permit improved diagnostic accuracy of cystic pancreatic lesions as shown by early feasibility studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>CLE (and to some extent endocytoscopy) may also have a role in the evaluation of organs outside the gastrointestinal tract. Probe-based CLE has been used for the detection and classification of chronic pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, probe-based CLE and endocytoscopy have been applied for the detection of bladder cancer via a transurethral approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17697294\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary contraindication to confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy is an allergy to the contrast agent being used. In addition, patients must be deemed fit candidates for endoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H4168208\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455771695\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a limited but increasing number of studies evaluating the accuracy of confocal laser endomicroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fewer studies have been performed with endocytoscopy. In general, most reported results have been good, with accuracy rates ranging between 80 and 95 percent. However, almost all of these studies were performed in centers with significant experience in endoscopic imaging technologies. The patients were highly selected, and the examiners in many studies were not blinded to other relevant clinical and endoscopic data. Furthermore, studies comparing CLE with other imaging techniques, such as narrow band imaging, are rare. Thus, further studies are needed to confirm the initially promising results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1911573\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of confocal laser endomicroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) has been studied for use in the upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, as well as in the hepatobiliary tree:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper GI applications have included detection of neoplasia in the esophagus and stomach, identification of Helicobacter pylori in the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and detection of villous atrophy and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes in the small bowel of patients with celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/19-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary focus on CLE in the lower GI tract has been for the differentiation of neoplastic from non-neoplastic polyps.

In addition, goblet cells, which are not seen in normal columnar esophagus, can be identified. Findings suggestive of neoplasia include a loss of the normal epithelial architecture, a variable epithelial layer width, a dark epithelial appearance, and the presence of irregular vasculature with leakage of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a>. </p><p>Studies of the sensitivity and specificity of CLE in detecting neoplasia in patients with Barrett's esophagus have had variable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/29-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-37</a>]. However, most studies suggest the sensitivity is at least 70 percent, and the specificity is at least 90 percent. The diagnostic yield with CLE was examined in a randomized trial with 192 patients with Barrett's esophagus who were assigned to either undergo high-definition white-light endoscopy and CLE with targeted biopsies or high-definition white-light endoscopy with random biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The diagnostic yield for neoplasia was higher among the patients who underwent CLE with targeted biopsies compared with those who had random biopsies (22 versus 6 percent).</p><p>Due to its deeper confocal imaging plane, CLE appears to be superior to endocytoscopy for the evaluation Barrett's esophagus and gastric neoplasia. (See <a href=\"#H1911398\" class=\"local\">'Stomach and columnar esophagus'</a> below.)</p><p>CLE has also been used to guide endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in patients with Barrett's esophagus.

Histopathology revealed low-grade dysplasia in six, high-grade dysplasia in 12, and no dysplasia in four. The sensitivity of CLE for dysplasia was 94 percent, with a specificity of 50 percent. By contrast, in another study aimed to assess if the use of pCLE in addition to high-definition white-light endoscopy could aid in the determination of residual dysplastic Barrett's esophagus after mucosal ablation or resection, the authors reported no additional benefit with pCLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1912081\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastric cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies suggest a possible role for CLE in the evaluation of gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>].

The sensitivity of CLE for gastric neoplasia was 82 to 91 percent, and the specificity was 98 percent. However, CLE failed to obtain adequate images in approximately 40 percent of the patients.

Endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy expand the imaging capabilities of flexible endoscopy by their ability to obtain &quot;optical biopsies&quot; of nearly any accessible endoluminal surface. (See <a href=\"#H455771632\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CLE and endocytoscopy can be performed with probe-based systems that are passed through the working channel of an endoscope or with integrated endoscopic systems. Currently, only probe-based systems are commercially available.

In general, CLE and endocytoscopy are used to target biopsies of abnormal tissue and to avoid taking biopsies of normal tissue. The goal is to increase diagnostic yield while minimizing procedure-related risks and the costs of tissue acquisition and analysis.
