These include oral or perioral lesions, ocular infections, nongenital skin lesions, genital skin or mucous membrane lesions, and serious systemic illnesses such as encephalitis and neonatal disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HSV-1 is transmitted from person-to-person via infected oral secretions during close contact. Infection occurs worldwide, equally between the sexes, and without seasonal variation. In the United States, there are estimated to be approximately 500,000 primary infections per annum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incubation period of oral infections ranges from 1 to 26 days (median 6 to 8 days) and lesions range from 1 to 8 days in duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. While infection is lifelong, it is rarely fatal in the immunocompetent host, producing either asymptomatic or mild clinical disease.</p><p>Herpetic keratitis continues to be the leading cause of blindness in industrialized countries, with the predominant disease being of the stromal type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Over the past 20 years, the prevalence of the disease has decreased in most developed countries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=herpes-simplex-keratitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Herpes simplex keratitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact with herpetic lesions or oral secretions can produce infection with HSV-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The viral titer is 100 to 1000 times greater when lesions are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; as a result, transmission is much more likely when the patient is symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Following primary infection, HSV can also sometimes be recovered from the stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In various series, HSV was obtained from 81 to 88 percent of vesicles, 34 percent of ulcers or crusts, and from the saliva in 3.6 to 25 percent of patients with a positive history or serology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>].</p><p>In one study, 2 to 9 percent of adults and 5 to 8 percent of children were asymptomatic salivary excretors of HSV-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Overall, 0.65 to 15 percent of adults may be excreting HSV-1 (or HSV-2) at anytime. There does not appear to be a correlation between ocular and oral infection with HSV-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Transmission of ocular HSV-1 has also been documented in a case of corneal transplantation into a HSV-1 seronegative patient with glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This infection resulted in the loss of sight. An additional discussion of HSV transmission in patients with keratitis is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=herpes-simplex-keratitis#H2080641963\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Herpes simplex keratitis&quot;, section on 'Risk of transmission to others'</a>.)</p><p>HSV-1 transmission via oral-genital contact has also been recognized as a contributing cause of increasing cases of HSV-1 genital herpes infection, especially among young women and men who have sex with men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;, section on 'Transmission'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SEROEPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worldwide, more than 90 percent of people are seropositive for HSV-1 by the fourth decade of life, especially those of lower socioeconomic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This pattern was also present in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s; however, the prevalence rates for people from industrialized countries and middle class societies have been declining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In a follow-up cross-sectional seroprevalence survey in the United States, trends in HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections in 1999 to 2004 (11,508 participants) were compared to 1988 to 1994 (9165 participants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The survey demonstrated that the seroprevalence of HSV-1 had declined from 62 to 58 percent, a relative decrease of 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A European study determined a seroprevalence of 65.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Subsequent data indicate that seroprevalence for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the United States is decreasing, suggesting that young adults may be at increased risk for primary infections with these viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Two studies have demonstrated that prior seropositivity to HSV-1 increased the likelihood of asymptomatic seroconversion for HSV-2 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>]. </p><p>Among 3438 HSV-seronegative women between the ages of 18 and 30 in the United States and Canada who were enrolled in the control arm of a herpes vaccine study and who were followed prospectively between 2003 and 2007, 183 became infected with HSV: 127 (3.7 percent) with HSV-1 and 56 (1.6 percent) with HSV-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The rate of infection for HSV-1 was more than twice the rate for HSV-2 (2.5 versus 1.1 per 100 person-years, respectively). </p><p>In the United States, seroprevalence has been reexamined using newer type-specific antibody assays and sera from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Among African-American children, more than 35 percent were positive for HSV-1 by the age of five compared to 18 percent in Caucasian children. HSV-1 antibodies remained twice as common in African-Americans through adolescence but the difference had disappeared by age 40.</p><p>For patients with a positive history of cold sores, the rates of seropositivity are higher (93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Antibody titers have not been found to correlate with positive cultures or the presence of lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Populations at risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous and ocular HSV-1 infections have been recognized as a health risk for athletes involved in contact sports and for healthcare workers. One study, for example, evaluated students at a high school wrestling camp: 34 percent had active herpetic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], which commonly involved the head (73 percent), extremities (42 percent), and trunk (28 percent). Interestingly, attack rates for wrestlers were higher for heavyweights compared to lightweights (67 versus 25 percent).</p><p>Healthcare workers comprise a second population at risk for infection with HSV-1. One report found that medical and nursing personnel had a slightly lower prevalence of antibodies to HSV-1 (less than 50 percent) than the general population (80 to 90 percent), making them particularly susceptible to primary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, HSV-1 is responsible for nosocomial outbreaks in many hospitals, providing another reason to adopt universal precautions.</p><p>In one reported case, a physician developed HSV-1 keratoconjunctivitis after intubating an immunocompromised patient with pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The physician had not been wearing eye protection or gloves during the procedure. In that hospital, nosocomial HSV-1 infection occurred in 9 to 15 of 10,000 hospital admissions per year.</p><p>Restriction endonuclease fingerprinting of HSV DNA has been used for contact tracing in nosocomial outbreaks of HSV. In at least one instance, it revealed that multiple isolates occurred in a &quot;single&quot; outbreak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>There may also be groups at reduced risk. There are, for example, two studies suggesting possible protection afforded by prior infection with one serotype of HSV on infection with the other. In one report, pregnant women with no prior infection with HSV had a 3.7 percent chance of seroconverting to HSV-2 during their pregnancy compared to 1.7 percent in those with prior exposure to HSV-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In another study of Japanese women with genital herpes, isolation of HSV-1 from the lesions correlated with seronegativity for HSV-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Transmission of neonatal HSV-1 generally occurs from nongenital and occasionally nonmaternal sources. In one series of six infants diagnosed with HSV-1 infection, only four mothers had past or current mucocutaneous HSV-1 infection, while all six fathers had positive histories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In one set, neither parent had active HSV at the time of neonatal infection.</p><p>A rapid rise in HSV-1 antibodies occurs during the first five years of life, coincident with a rise in primary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In one report, 20 percent of normal children between the ages of seven months and two years had HSV in their saliva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HSV-1 RECURRENCE PATTERNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent HSV-1 infections of the lips and perioral area are estimated to occur in 20 to 40 percent of the population worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among patients with recurrence, there is substantial variability in the frequency with which this occurs, ranging from once per month in 5 to 23 percent to every one to four months in 58 to 61 percent to twice per year in 19 to 61 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/6,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,30</a>]. No differences between the sexes have been observed.</p><p>Recurrent ocular HSV-1 infections are also common. Approximately 25 to 50 percent of patients with primary herpetic keratitis will have a recurrence within two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>HSV-1 recurs more often in the orolabial region and HSV-2 recurs more often in the genital area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/1,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32</a>]. In one study, for example, the mean monthly recurrence rate for orolabial HSV-1 was twenty-fold higher than for orolabial HSV-2 (0.020 versus 0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In the same report, the rate of genital HSV-2 recurrences was much higher (0.33 per month).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">THE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED HOST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSV-1 infection in the immunocompromised host causes more morbidity and mortality than in the general population. This relationship can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series, 62 percent of fatalities following renal transplantation were caused by viruses, with HSV contributing in 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The incidence of HSV-1 infection after renal transplantation has ranged from 35 to 85 percent, depending upon the presence and amount of antibody to HSV and the level of immunosuppression required to prevent graft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Exogenous infection does not appear to be a factor in posttransplant HSV-1 infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of 40 patients undergoing chemotherapy for a variety of malignancies, the presence of HSV-1 in oral mucosa, as assessed by PCR, was detected in 70 percent prior to chemotherapy and 87.5 percent two weeks after initiation of the chemotherapeutic cycle. While 25 percent of patients manifested oral disease prior to starting chemotherapy, 65.7 percent of patients had oral mucosal changes at the second two-week assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort of bone marrow transplant recipients, 82 percent of seropositive patients developed reactivation of HSV after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. HSV infection in these patients was usually secondary to endogenous reactivation rather than primary infection; the presence of antibody to HSV in the donor did not affect the response of the recipient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of HSV-1 cutaneous infections in HIV-infected patients is in the range of 5 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Lesions tend to be more severe than in immunocompetent hosts, demonstrating local destruction and persistent shedding of virus. In addition, the incidence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> resistance in immunocompromised patients is higher than in the general population. In contrast to cutaneous infection, the incidence of herpetic keratitis in HIV-infected patients is similar to that in the HIV-negative population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24975914\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSV-1 is transmitted from person-to-person via infected oral secretions during close contact.
