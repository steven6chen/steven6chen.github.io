Weakness is present in both proximal and distal muscles. Most patients have globally diminished or absent reflexes. Cranial nerve and bulbar involvement occur in a minority. The clinical course of CIDP is slowly progressive in a majority of patients, but a relapsing-remitting course is noted in at least one-third.</p><p>Of major importance, CIDP generally responds to immunomodulatory treatment with glucocorticoids, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, or plasma exchange.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of CIDP will be reviewed here. Other aspects of CIDP are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177220666\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are some patients with CIDP who have such mild disease with minimal impact on function and quality of life that treatment is not required. However, most patients are significantly impaired by the disorder and need treatment. The mainstays of therapy for CIDP are intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), glucocorticoids, and plasma exchange. (See <a href=\"#H177221497\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy and ongoing therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous immune globulin'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Plasma exchange'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with CIDP should be re-evaluated routinely (eg, at least every three months when treatments are initiated or changed, and at least twice a year when on maintenance therapy) to determine whether they are responding to therapy. Maintenance therapy is needed for responders with active disease. Therapy can be stopped for those who achieve remission, but relapses are common. (See <a href=\"#H177221150\" class=\"local\">'Assessing response to therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H177221510\" class=\"local\">'Classifying disease activity'</a> below and <a href=\"#H177221785\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>A different therapy should be substituted for those who fail to respond to the initial mode of therapy. Alternative immunosuppressant treatment options are available for patients who are refractory to treatment with IVIG, glucocorticoids, and plasma exchange. (See <a href=\"#H177221497\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy and ongoing therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H177220376\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Other immune modulators'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177221497\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial therapy and ongoing therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For treatment-na&iuml;ve patients with CIDP who have active disease and related disability, we recommend initial immune modulating treatment using either IVIG, glucocorticoids, or plasma exchange. The initial choice among these equally effective therapies is influenced by disease severity, concurrent illness, venous access, treatment side effects, availability, and cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe and fulminant CIDP, we suggest treatment with a rapid immune modulating therapy such as IVIG, plasma exchange, or pulse high dose glucocorticoids, rather than standard dose daily glucocorticoids. We prefer initial treatment with IVIG (if available) or pulse glucocorticoids because they are usually easier to administer than plasma exchange. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous immune globulin'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Plasma exchange'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with more insidious CIDP, where the goal is to achieve remission, we suggest initial therapy with glucocorticoids without IVIG or plasma exchange. A glucocorticoid course of up to eight weeks of pulse-high doses may be required to decide whether there is a treatment response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Alternative immunosuppressive agents are employed when glucocorticoids are contraindicated or considered too risky; choices include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>. However, the effectiveness of these drugs for CIDP is not established. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Other immune modulators'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who fail to respond to the initial mode of therapy, a different therapy should be substituted. As an example of treatment substitution, failure to respond to IVIG might trigger intervention with plasma exchange <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunosuppression with glucocorticoids. The potential yield of this approach is illustrated by a series of patients with CIDP that included 26 who did not respond to initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Of these, benefit from an alternative treatment was observed in nine (35 percent). For 11 patients who required a third alternative treatment, benefit was observed in three (17 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small portion of patients (&lt;20 percent) who respond to the initial therapy may need no further treatment. However, most patients will relapse sooner or later, and those who respond to IVIG or plasma exchange may require repeated treatment at intervals that typically range from two to six weeks. Similarly, relapses are common with glucocorticoid therapy, particularly when tapering the dose. Thus, for patients with CIDP who relapse after responding to initial therapy, we suggest repeating the initially successful treatment modality. For patients on glucocorticoid therapy who relapse, stopping the taper and increasing the dose is suggested. The timing and dose of ongoing intermittent treatments should be titrated to avoid relapses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients initially treated with IVIG who continue to require high doses for many months, we suggest adding glucocorticoid therapy or an alternative immunosuppressant in the hope of eventually discontinuing IVIG and achieving clinical remission. Similarly, we suggest adding glucocorticoid therapy for patients initially treated with plasma exchange who require frequent treatments over many months.</p><p/><p>Suggested doses of IVIG, plasma exchange, and glucocorticoids are discussed in below. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous immune globulin'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Plasma exchange'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177221150\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing response to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The criteria for treatment effect vary per patient. Some patients may not improve, but the treatment may still be considered effective if the disease stabilizes without developing progressive deficits. Some abnormalities, due to severe axonal loss, may be fixed deficits and will not respond to highly effective treatments (see <a href=\"#H177221510\" class=\"local\">'Classifying disease activity'</a> below). It is important for the clinician and patient to be clear on what is likely to respond and the anticipated timing of the response. In addition, patients and clinicians need to understand that there may be improvements in energy and well-being that do not necessarily point to an effect on the disease itself.</p><p>Ideally, the success or failure of treatment should be judged using objective methods to quantify clinical improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], such as grip strength dynamometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>] and measures of impairment such as the <a href=\"http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/peripheral_nerve/patient_info/RODS+for+GBS-CIDP+2.pdf&amp;token=+2FzTaHVTKiyhrfNk1q3RQ6l+mRI1aoTxHiSPVi168Bb+fec5bfPob6tjcslQdmcDzYxdBuw7mby1PJhZdZgdJaExHjjZN2b1JG83CS2HcpnT1MO5dB3x8G5UizYP2xrrpYU0hNX1pwZKL622Gw/qd6K9M9URLFCz/IDzrWxul8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5265\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale</a> (<a href=\"http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/peripheral_nerve/patient_info/RODS+for+GBS-CIDP+2.pdf&amp;token=+2FzTaHVTKiyhrfNk1q3RQ6l+mRI1aoTxHiSPVi168Bb+fec5bfPob6tjcslQdmcDzYxdBuw7mby1PJhZdZgdJaExHjjZN2b1JG83CS2HcpnT1MO5dB3x8G5UizYP2xrrpYU0hNX1pwZKL622Gw/qd6K9M9URLFCz/IDzrWxul8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5265\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">RODS</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F105872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105872 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], or the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment Disability Scale (INCAT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The CDAS classifies patients into five main categories, with subcategories based mainly upon results of the neurologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1) Cure: &ge;5 years off treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A) Normal examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>B) Abnormal examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">stable/improving</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2) Remission: &lt;5 years off treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A) Normal examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>B) Abnormal examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">stable/improving</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3) Stable active disease: &ge;1 year on treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A) Normal examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>B) Abnormal examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">stable/improving</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4) Improvement: &ge;3 months to &lt;1 year on treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A) Normal examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>B) Abnormal examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">stable/improving</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5) Unstable active disease: abnormal examination with progressive or relapsing course</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A) Treatment na&iuml;ve or &lt;3 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>B) Off treatment (treatment refractory from prior therapy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>C) On treatment (worsening despite ongoing therapy)</p><p/><p>The CDAS recognizes that some patients have long-term neurologic deficits despite effective treatment.

Therefore, treatment can be discontinued for patients who achieve sustained remission (eg, 12 months or longer); though careful follow-up is needed for possible relapses and the need for resuming therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177220376\"><span class=\"h2\">Refractory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with severe CIDP (eg, unstable active disease with a progressive or relapsing course) who are refractory to treatment with IVIG, glucocorticoids, and plasma exchange, and are also refractory to glucocorticoids combined with IVIG or plasma exchange, alternative immunosuppressant treatment options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Other immune modulators'</a> below). The choice among these is dependent on a number of factors that include the expertise of the treating center and clinician, side effect profiles of the alternative treatments, disease severity, age and sex of patient, and concurrent medical problems. We recommend that patients who are refractory to initial treatment be evaluated at a center with particular expertise in CIDP. The <a href=\"http://www.gbs-cidp.org/&amp;token=dsy9+VV0ucjfL7ZsrxHAU5mkzNavB66YlTKjhqU/Hx+vALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=5265\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">GBS/CIDP Foundation International</a> has a number of designated <a href=\"http://www.gbs-cidp.org/get-support/centers-of-excellence/&amp;token=UPIKAulBFWAUL3q8dLQ9EI5GKjwJ3mH88OMGod6q9J4ol3HCN/omRLFtcrx7yegkcr6ZXQdtD7K9oy3uIn243A==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5265\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers of Excellence</a> that are available for consultation.</p><p>Among these choices, our preferred alternative treatment for patients with no contraindications is oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (7.5 to 15 mg once a week). Patients treated with methotrexate should receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> 1 mg daily, or folinic acid 2.5 mg weekly, to prevent hematologic and other side effects. It is unclear whether a response to methotrexate occurs within three or four months or takes longer. We suggest at least a four month trial, if the clinical condition allows.</p><p>For patients with moderately severe disease who do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, our preferred alternative treatment is a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>.

Improvement with cyclosporine therapy may occur within three months. However, the side effect profile for cyclosporine is greater than for methotrexate.</p><p>Most specialists believe that pulse IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> can be effective and can lead to long term remission. The usual dosing is 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> infused monthly for six months. However, the risks and side effects must be carefully considered. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Other immune modulators'</a> below.)</p><p>Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has been used as a treatment of last resort for patients with CIDP that is refractory to first- and second-line therapies, with reported benefit in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The main risk associated with AHSCT is infection related to immune suppression. Whether AHSCT is more effective than a lower dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> regimen is not known.

In addition, the ICE results suggested that the benefit of IVIG extends to as long as 48 weeks with maintenance treatments of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> every three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As a result of these findings, the IVIG formulation used in this trial became the first FDA-approved treatment for CIDP. However, it should be understood that there is no known difference in effectiveness between different IVIG preparations.</p><p/><p>While IVIG therapy can usually control CIDP, most patients require repeated expensive treatments every two to six weeks for many years, since IVIG monotherapy does not usually lead to remission. This point is illustrated by a 20-year review of 95 patients treated with IVIG for CIDP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. More than 75 percent of the patients improved, but of those who improved, over 85 percent required repeated treatment, while fewer than 15 percent were able to discontinue treatment at a mean of 3.5 years and median of 2.1 years. Severity at onset and residual deficit were negative predictors of discontinuation. However, the placebo effect in the ICE trial, as well as in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> trial, suggests that the number of patients who remain stable after discontinuation of IVIG may be significantly greater than 15 percent.</p><p>IVIG should be used cautiously in patients with severe kidney disease because of its association with renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Benefit may not be apparent after the first course of IVIG treatment, and some experts advocate repeating infusion of IVIG (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> every <strong>three</strong> weeks for two to three months after the initial treatment before determining efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Others advocate a slightly more frequent dosing (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> every <strong>two</strong> weeks for two to three months) before determining efficacy.</p><p>Many patients with CIDP require repeat IVIG maintenance dosing every two to six weeks.

How fast to taper and when to taper depend on a variety of factors. However, there is increasing use of intravenous or oral pulse glucocorticoids rather than daily oral prednisone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], and we prefer the use of pulse glucocorticoids, either oral or intravenous, rather than daily oral prednisone, for initiation and titration of dosing. Pulse dosing may have both a greater chance for early efficacy and a lower side effect profile.</p><p>Chronic glucocorticoid use is limited by common and clinically important side effects that include weight gain, cushingoid appearance, easy bruising and skin fragility, cataracts, aseptic necrosis of the femoral or humeral heads, hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Thus, glucocorticoid therapy is generally contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcer disease, brittle diabetes, refractory hypertension, severe osteoporosis, and systemic fungal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

For the primary endpoint, the remission rate at 12 months, there was no significant difference between the pulsed high-dose dexamethasone and standard prednisolone treatment groups (10 of 24 [42 percent] versus 6 of 16 [38 percent], odds ratio 1.19, 95% CI 0.3-4.4). While this study did not show an advantage for pulsed dexamethasone, it does provide an alternative regimen for giving glucocorticoids that may be useful for some patients. Some practitioners believe that weight gain and cushingoid side effects are less with pulsed glucocorticoid treatment, while sleep and psychologic effects may be greater.</p><p>Although less well-studied, retrospective evidence suggests that weekly pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (500 mg once a week) is also an effective option for long-term treatment of CIDP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Alternate-day glucocorticoid therapy may reduce the incidence of side effects, but some experts believe it is less effective than a daily dosing regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Daily dosing may be preferred for younger patients and those patients with little in the way of side effects. In addition, daily dosing may be preferred in patients with diabetes, so that there is a more even daily effect on blood sugars.</p><p>One suggested oral regimen is to start <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily (usually around 50 to 80 mg daily; no more than 100 mg). The dose is then titrated according to clinical response. Patients who have a good response can begin dose tapering after one to three months.</p><p>Glucocorticoid tapering can be done in many ways and should be individualized as a daily or every other day regimen. The dose can be tapered by 5 to 10 mg every two to four weeks in clinically stable patients.</p><p>As an example, with the every other day regimen, the taper from 80 mg daily would begin with 80 mg alternating with 60 mg, then a month later to 80 mg alternating with 40 mg, and eventually to 80 mg alternating with 0 mg. Tapering of the high-dose day would then commence. We suggest slowing down the rate of the taper once a dose of 30 mg every other day (or 15 mg daily) is reached. It is usually necessary to go back up to a higher dose by at least 10 to 20 mg if symptoms recur during the taper.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravenous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with oral glucocorticoid therapy, there is no standard regimen for pulse intravenous (IV) glucocorticoids.

Tapering is accomplished by slowly decreasing the frequency of dosing to once every 2 to 12 weeks.</p><p>Limited observational data suggest that IV and oral glucocorticoid regimens are equally effective, but that IV therapy is associated with less weight gain and fewer cushingoid features, but possibly more restlessness and sleep problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The dreaded risks of avascular necrosis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and osteoporotic bone fracture are not known to be different between the different regimens.

These studies included intravenous pulse regimens and oral daily regimens of cyclophosphamide for patients who failed other therapies.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous immune globulin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Plasma exchange'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe and fulminant CIDP, we suggest treatment with a rapid immune modulating therapy such as IVIG, plasma exchange, or pulse high dose glucocorticoids, rather than standard dose daily glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We prefer initial treatment with IVIG (if available) or pulse glucocorticoids because they are usually easier to administer than plasma exchange. For patients with more insidious CIDP, where the goal is to achieve remission, we suggest initial therapy with glucocorticoids with or without IVIG or plasma exchange (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H177220666\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who fail to respond to the initial mode of therapy, we would substitute an alternative treatment. As an example, failure to respond to IVIG triggers intervention with plasma exchange or glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H177220666\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CIDP should be re-evaluated routinely to determine whether they are responding to therapy. Maintenance therapy is needed for responders with active disease. Therapy can be stopped for those who achieve remission, but relapses are common. (See <a href=\"#H177221150\" class=\"local\">'Assessing response to therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H177221510\" class=\"local\">'Classifying disease activity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H177221785\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with CIDP who respond to initial IVIG or plasmapheresis therapy will relapse when the therapy is discontinued and will require treatment. For such patients, we retreat and suggest repeating the initially successful treatment modality (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients on glucocorticoid therapy who relapse, stopping the taper <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increasing the dose is reasonable. The timing and dose of ongoing intermittent treatments should be titrated to avoid relapses. (See <a href=\"#H177220666\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with CIDP initially treated with IVIG who require high dose therapy for many months, we suggest adding glucocorticoid therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Similarly, we suggest adding glucocorticoid therapy for patients initially treated with plasma exchange who require frequent treatments over many months (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H177220666\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe CIDP who are refractory to treatment with IVIG, glucocorticoids, and plasma exchange, and are also refractory to glucocorticoids combined with IVIG or plasma exchange, or have unacceptable side effects with these regimens, we suggest treatment with an alternative immunosuppressant (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. The choice among these agents must be individualized. Patients should be informed that the benefit of these therapies for CIDP is unproven, and that these treatments are associated with a risk of serious side effects. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Other immune modulators'</a> above and <a href=\"#H177220376\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis of CIDP is generally favorable, but data are limited. Approximately 30 percent of patients achieve cure or long-term remission, while approximately 18 percent have unstable active disease with a progressive or relapsing course.
