In secondary prevention, the absolute benefits on occlusive events are far greater than the absolute risks of major bleeding. In primary prevention, however, among apparently healthy people, the benefit-to-risk ratio is less clear due, at least in part, to the paucity of randomized evidence among the moderate- to high-risk subjects most likely to achieve a net benefit. &#160;</p><p>While the benefits of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> on CVD have been known for decades, more recent randomized evidence has suggested a benefit on colorectal cancer and possibly total cancer deaths as well as on the development of other cancers. These findings may impact the threshold for the prescription of aspirin by health care professionals and the wishes of primary prevention subjects. &#160;</p><p>This topic summarizes the evidence regarding the benefits and risks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for primary prevention of CVD and cancer.

These findings are achieved by daily doses of 75 mg (and higher) or perhaps doses as low as 30 mg. Higher doses of aspirin also inhibit COX-2, which blocks prostaglandin production leading to analgesic and antipyretic effects. Although other mechanisms have been proposed (eg, an antiinflammatory effect), the antiplatelet effect seems sufficient to explain the observed statistically significant and clinically important benefits of aspirin on CVD.

Aspirin possibly reduces the risk of colorectal cancer over long-term follow-up (with &gt;10 years of treatment). (See <a href=\"#H1761531\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of CVD events'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1761545\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of cancer'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4293447308\" class=\"local\">'Reducing all-cause mortality'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1898937\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimates of the very small absolute benefits and risks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in primary prevention are provided in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86941\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86941 \">table 1</a>). Clinicians can use these estimates as a starting point for discussions with individual patients. Not all informed patients will choose to use aspirin and individual discussion is imperative. (See <a href=\"#H1761594\" class=\"local\">'Assessing benefits and risks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors to be considered in this discussion include assessment of the individual's risk for each outcome (cardiovascular events, colorectal cancer, bleeding, and total mortality); assessment of the relative value the individual places on preventing specific outcomes; assessment of the patient's attitude to inconvenience of long-term daily therapy; and value placed on immediate increase in risk of bleeding versus delayed potential benefit on death. (See <a href=\"#H1722732\" class=\"local\">'Individualizing decisions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In many adults, the benefits of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> exceed the risks (principally bleeding). For individuals age &ge;50 years without excess bleeding risk, we suggest low-dose daily aspirin (75 to 100 mg) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Patients who are more concerned about the bleeding risks than the potential benefits may reasonably choose to not take aspirin for primary prevention.
