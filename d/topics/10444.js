Atypical neuroimaging features may be a clue that a dural-based mass is something other than a benign, World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningioma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109029\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109029 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Patients who are being considered for observation or empiric radiation therapy may benefit from more extensive systemic evaluation to help exclude alternative etiologies, particularly when imaging features are atypical. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meningioma#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, and diagnosis of meningioma&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Small, asymptomatic tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many meningiomas are discovered incidentally on a neuroimaging study (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT]) obtained for symptoms or events unrelated to the tumor. Such tumors may remain unchanged in size or grow only very slowly over prolonged periods. As a result, most patients with small asymptomatic meningiomas can be safely observed; treatment is instituted only if the tumor enlarges significantly or becomes symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. We generally consider asymptomatic tumors up to approximately 2 cm in diameter to be small, although this is not a strict cutoff, and location must also be considered. </p><p>The rationale for active surveillance is illustrated by a retrospective population-based study of 1434 consecutive patients with meningioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In this series, 603 patients (42 percent) were asymptomatic and 351 of these were managed with observation. Of the 171 patients followed for more than one year, 31 were subsequently treated with either surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), in most cases due to tumor growth. Among the 67 asymptomatic patients with follow-up of more than five years, 63 percent did not have evidence of tumor growth. Among the 213 asymptomatic patients treated surgically, morbidity occurred in 4 percent of those less than 70 years of age and in 9 percent of those &ge;70 years. These data suggest that a large proportion of asymptomatic patients do not become symptomatic in the short-term, providing a rationale for active surveillance. </p><p>Our approach to the management of small, asymptomatic meningiomas is to reassess the patient with MRI or CT after three to six months. If the patient remains asymptomatic and there is no evidence of tumor growth, the patient can then be monitored with neuroimaging on an annual basis for three to five years, then every two to three years for as long as they remain a candidate for intervention.</p><p>A &quot;watch and wait&quot; approach is particularly suitable for older patients and those with significant comorbidity. For relatively healthy younger patients, there is a lower threshold for therapeutic intervention because of the expectation that tumor progression will inevitably require active treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3222236007\"><span class=\"h2\">Large or symptomatic tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic meningiomas and asymptomatic tumors that are large, expanding, infiltrating, or associated with surrounding edema should be surgically resected if feasible. Complete surgical resection is preferred when a meningioma is in an accessible location, since complete resection of the tumor and its dural attachment can be curative. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Extent of resection'</a> below.)</p><p>Multiple advances in neurosurgery, including microsurgery, improved preoperative imaging, and intraoperative image-guided approaches, have extended the neurosurgeon's ability to resect lesions that were previously considered only partially resectable or unresectable, while minimizing damage to normal brain. Advances in endoscopic endonasal surgery have made anterior cranial base and clival tumors in particular more resectable as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Surgery is often combined with radiation therapy (RT) in the initial management of atypical and malignant meningiomas (WHO grades II and III) because the risk of recurrence is high and negative surgical margins cannot be assured.

The use of modern adjuvant RT techniques to treat residual disease appears to yield results comparable to more aggressive surgery and can minimize treatment-related neurologic deficits. (See <a href=\"#H3984868175\" class=\"local\">'RT after partial resection'</a> below.)</p><p>In contemporary practice, the goal of surgery is to achieve as extensive a resection as possible while minimizing neurologic deficits. The extent of resection varies depending upon the location of the tumor, whether there is imaging evidence of invasion, and the presurgical status of the patient (eg, neurologic deficits, comorbidity).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete resection is usually attempted for tumors of the convexity, olfactory groove, anterior third of the sagittal sinus, and some tentorial and posterior fossa tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial resection rather than complete resection may be more appropriate for less accessible tumors, such as those involving the posterior sagittal sinus region or clivus. Residual tumor, particularly if it is atypical or malignant, can be treated postoperatively with RT.

Definitive RT is the treatment of choice in these cases. (See <a href=\"#H4144441906\" class=\"local\">'Nonresectable tumors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Because meningiomas are vascular tumors, preoperative embolization may be useful to increase resectability in carefully selected patients with skull base or giant convexity meningiomas in which the presumed feeding arteries are not readily accessible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>], but there are no well conducted prospective studies and there is wide variability in utilization. In retrospective series of up to 200 patients, the reported complication rate of preoperative embolization ranges from 3 to 13 percent, with most complications being minor and transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Rare major or long-term complications include intratumoral hemorrhage, stroke, and cranial neuropathies. When indicated, this procedure can be performed the day prior to surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical morbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative neurologic deficits can be a direct complication of surgery. The reported incidence of such neurologic deficits ranges from 2 to 30 percent depending upon the location of the tumor and the extent of the resection. Cortical brain injury may occur if the arachnoid and pia are adherent to the tumor and there is disruption of the pial vasculature with subsequent cortical microinfarction. Cranial nerve deficits are a risk in surgery for skull base meningiomas, and intraoperative cranial nerve monitoring should be used for tumors located near the cranial nerves.</p><p>The reported overall surgical mortality has varied widely, reflecting differences in patient selection criteria as well as changes in surgical care. Factors associated with an increased mortality included poor preoperative clinical condition, brain compression from tumor, advanced age, incomplete tumor removal, and intracranial hematoma requiring evacuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Older series indicated that the mortality was higher in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. More recent series, using contemporary neurosurgical techniques, have shown that surgery is feasible in carefully selected older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. As an example, there was no perioperative mortality in a carefully selected series of 74 patients aged &ge;80 years, and the incidence of postoperative complications was only 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Perioperative medical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to neurologic deficits that are a direct consequence of surgery, common medical complications include seizures, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures are a frequent presenting symptom of meningiomas.

In one small series, for example, almost three-fourths of patients had evidence of postoperative DVT following surgery for intracranial meningioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The hemostatic disorder in these patients resembles a chronic subclinical form of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin is recommended postoperatively for patients requiring craniotomy for removal of a meningioma. In addition, pneumatic compression boots should be used until the patient is ambulatory.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma#H537373725\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of atypical and malignant (WHO grade II and III) meningioma&quot;, section on 'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Adjuvant RT for incompletely resected benign WHO grade I meningiomas also improves local control, but many patients will not recur or will progress slowly after surgery and can avoid the potential morbidity of immediate radiation therapy. In single-center observational studies with prolonged follow-up, the local progression rate after subtotal resection of benign meningiomas is approximately 40 to 50 percent at 5 years and approximately 60 percent at 10 years in most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Adjuvant RT is therefore used more selectively after partial resection grade I meningiomas compared with higher grade tumors. Retrospective data do support the role of RT in patients who have undergone subtotal resection of meningiomas in poorly accessible areas such as the skull base or posterior sagittal sinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].

When RT is used postoperatively to treat residual disease, a dose of 50 to 54 Gy in daily fractions of 1.8 to 2 Gy is generally used for benign meningiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Higher doses of radiation are generally recommended for WHO grade II and III meningiomas but have not been found to improve local control in WHO grade I meningiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The approach is most commonly used for skull base meningiomas and optic nerve sheath meningiomas. (See <a href=\"#H444768040\" class=\"local\">'Skull base meningiomas'</a> below and <a href=\"#H444768047\" class=\"local\">'Optic nerve sheath meningiomas'</a> below.)</p><p>Tumor size is an important factor that cannot be underestimated when considering RT alone. Larger tumors are associated with an increased risk of reactive edema following RT, which can cause seizures and neurologic deficits that vary based upon the location of the tumor. Subtotal resection in advance of RT is often considered in such cases in an attempt to decrease the risk for RT-related complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444767541\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newer conformal RT techniques, including SRS, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT), and proton radiotherapy, help to minimize radiation to the normal brain at large and are particularly important for the delivery of radiation to meningiomas that are in close proximity to critical structures such as the pituitary gland and the optic nerves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444767548\"><span class=\"h4\">Stereotactic radiosurgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SRS utilizes multiple convergent beams to deliver a high single dose of radiation to a radiographically discrete treatment volume, thereby minimizing injury to adjacent structures. An external localization system is used to increase accuracy of radiation targeting and delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-cranial-radiosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SRS is an alternative to surgery for small tumors in selected sites where complete excision is difficult or in patients at high risk for complications with surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. Although no randomized trials have been completed comparing SRS to surgery or other radiotherapy techniques, the outcomes appear to be similar to surgery for small to medium-sized meningiomas. In three large series, involving overall almost 400 patients with cavernous sinus meningiomas treated with SRS to a dose of 12 to 14 Gy, the five-year tumor control rate ranged from 94 to 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/30,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35,36</a>]. If doses above 18 Gy are used, there is a significant risk of toxicity to cranial nerves within the cavernous sinus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444767555\"><span class=\"h4\">Stereotactic radiotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SRT uses focused radiation in the same way as SRS but fractionates the radiation over a series of sessions. Fractionation improves normal tissue tolerance of radiation, and SRT may be a reasonable alternative for patients with surgically inaccessible lesions, either as postoperative therapy following subtotal resection or to treat local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. It is generally used instead of SRS when there is concern for normal tissue injury, either because of large tumor size or proximity to radiation sensitive structures, most commonly the optic nerves or chiasm.

There is comparatively more availability and experience with protons than other ion therapies. The rationale of proton therapy in treating patients with meningioma is to avoid acute and long term potential adverse effects in a patient population with projected long term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/28,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,42,43</a>].</p><p>Protons achieve greater avoidance of normal tissue radiation dose than photon-based techniques. In turn, protons may help to prevent side effects such as radiation-associated secondary tumors and hypopituitarism, if the irradiated target is in proximity to the pituitary. As with photon radiation, technological advancements have made intensity modulation feasible with protons, a technique called intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Additional experience is required to determine whether or not these approaches offer any benefit compared with other contemporary conformal techniques. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2197723961\"><span class=\"h2\">Older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation alone is an alternative to surgery in older adults, particularly for small tumors in deep or functionally high-risk locations. In a retrospective study of 121 older adults with radiologic evidence of a benign meningioma (median age 73 years, range 70 to 85), radiation therapy was associated with &gt;90 percent local control and cause-specific survival at five years with minimal toxicity and no new neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Sphenoid wing, petroclival, and frontobasal tumors made up approximately two-thirds of the tumors in this series. Most were treated with fractionated or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy.</p><p>Importantly, size of unresected tumors should be carefully considered. Tumors with significant mass effect may cause significant symptoms and reactive edema following radiation therapy that can be fatal in some cases. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1796950775\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with a history of cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a newly discovered dural-based mass sometimes have a remote history of cancer or an early-stage cancer that has not metastasized. Although metastatic disease should be considered during the initial evaluation in these patients, it is often the case that meningioma remains the most likely diagnosis, particularly when neuroimaging features are typical for meningioma and there is no evidence of metastatic disease outside the central nervous system. Our approach to initial management in these patients is the same as for patients without a history of cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109114\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109114 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H324397690\" class=\"local\">'Approach to initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>When cancer metastasizes to the dura, it is usually a relatively late-stage event in patients with known metastatic disease involving bone and other organs, and neuroimaging features will not be entirely typical for meningioma. Breast, prostate, and lung cancers are the most common cancer types associated with dural metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In cases where metastatic disease is considered at least as or more likely than meningioma, empiric radiation therapy is often preferred over surgery, unless the tumor is very large or tissue diagnosis is critical for optimal treatment planning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109114\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109114 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Radiation-induced meningiomas have a higher risk of atypical or high-grade features, and surgery is generally preferred as a first-line therapy, when possible.

There are no randomized trials comparing different approaches.</p><p>Optimal therapy needs to be individualized, based upon the anatomic location of the tumor and patient-specific considerations. Results are discussed for three meningioma locations, convexity meningiomas (which usually can be managed with surgery alone), skull base lesions (which often require a multidisciplinary approach), and optic nerve sheath meningiomas (for which radiation therapy [RT] is often used alone), as well as the limited data available for treatment of radiation-induced meningiomas. Evolving research also indicates that the genetic profile of meningiomas varies by tumor location and may also impact prognosis.

Patients with minimal or no symptoms were initially managed with observation.

Radiation treatment alone was used in 13 cases and 15 patients were managed with observation. At a median follow-up of five years, only one patient had evidence of tumor progression using this treatment paradigm. There were no treatment-related deaths, and serious complications from surgery were limited to hemiparesis, new cranial nerve palsy, and osteomyelitis (2.8, 2.8, and 1.4 percent of surgical cases, respectively).</p><p>In another series, 101 patients with presumed benign skull base meningiomas were treated with fractionated radiation therapy alone (66 cases) or after subtotal resection (35 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

In this setting, the use of RT must consider the prior radiation dosage to the brain in planning treatment.
