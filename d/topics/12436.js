Parenthood can represent normalcy, happiness, and life fulfillment. Cancer survivors are often fearful that their history of cancer or its treatment will have an adverse impact on offspring conceived after their cancer treatment, such as placing them at risk for malignancy, congenital anomalies, or impaired growth and development. They are also concerned about the risks of cancer recurrence, infertility, miscarriage, and achieving a successful pregnancy outcome.</p><p>Despite these concerns, surveys of female cancer survivors in California and Sweden reported that only about 50 percent recalled receiving reproductive health counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]; the proportion is higher in male cancer survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. A subsequent study reported that receiving counseling about reproductive loss and the option to try to preserve fertility before treatment was important to survivors, even if they were unable to have children after chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Others have noted that the rate of elective pregnancy termination among female cancer survivors was higher compared to sibling controls because of the fear that their prior cancer therapy would affect their children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patient education regarding future reproductive function is thus an important component of the care of individuals with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H462932647\"><span class=\"h1\">FERTILITY ISSUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of infertility among cancer survivors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infertility in cancer survivors can be caused by injury to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, as well as damage to the organs of the reproductive tract.

Despite being equally likely to seek treatment for infertility, female survivors were less likely than their siblings to be prescribed drugs for treatment of infertility (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.46-0.70). Risk factors for infertility included increasing doses of uterine radiation and alkylating agent chemotherapy.

Cryopreservation of embryos or oocytes is a proven approach, while cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is considered investigational. In some cases, ovarian function can be preserved by transposition of gonads; auto-transplantation of gonadal tissue is an investigational procedure. The safety and efficacy of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists for prevention of ovarian toxicity is controversial and an active area of investigation.</p><p>The primary approach to fertility preservation in men is cryopreservation of sperm. Suppression of testicular function during chemotherapy by administration of GnRH agonists has not been successful.</p><p>These methods for preserving fertility in women and men are reviewed in detail separately.

Whether infertility is transient or permanent, and the duration of transient infertility, cannot be predicted reliably. Furthermore, the presence of functioning gonads does not reliably predict that pregnancy will occur.</p><p>Premenopausal women who have amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles should be evaluated for premature ovarian failure. The clinical manifestations are similar to those in women with spontaneous ovarian failure. However, in young women with amenorrhea after chemotherapy, diagnosis of premature ovarian failure can be problematic since ovarian dysfunction may not be permanent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure#H811668192\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Premenopausal women with regular menstrual cycles should undergo assessment of ovarian reserve. A low antim&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) level may be the best test for prediction of diminished ovarian reserve in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Data from a variety of infertility patients (including breast cancer survivors) planning in vitro fertilization (IVF) suggest that a low AMH level before the procedure is a useful marker for predicting women at risk for a poor response or no response to ovarian stimulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;, section on 'Assessment of ovarian reserve'</a>.)</p><p>In men, fertility potential is evaluated by semen analysis. If repeated semen analyses demonstrate severe oligozoospermia (less than 5 million <span class=\"nowrap\">spermatozoa/mL)</span> or azoospermia, basal serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone should be measured. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-male-with-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the male with infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19042801\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of cancer recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the possible exception of gestational trophoblastic disease, pregnancy does not affect the risk of recurrence of any type of cancer. In particular, the risk of recurrent melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>] or breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>] does not appear to be affected by a subsequent pregnancy. The optimal timing of pregnancy after conclusion of cancer treatment is uncertain and depends, in part, on patient-specific factors (eg, type of treatment, tumor type, prognosis). In general, as the highest risk for cancer recurrence is in the first two years after completing treatment, most authors suggest waiting this time period before attempting conception, after a thorough evaluation confirming cancer remission or cure. However, a pregnancy that occurs spontaneously within the first two years after completing cancer treatment does not suggest that cancer is more likely to recur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational breast cancer: Epidemiology and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112689416\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of infertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of infertility after cancer therapy depends on the cause(s). Several factors may be contributing to infertility and some or all of these factors may have been present prior to therapy. Treatment is generally the same as that for patients without a history of cancer. Exceptions may include estrogen receptor positive breast cancer survivors and women treated with high-dose radiation involving the uterus. Women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer may benefit from ovulation induction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> or aromatase inhibitors. Women with a history of uterine radiation are counseled that limited evidence suggests lower fecundity and an increased incidence of pregnancy complications after uterine radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for female infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for male infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection#H5410837\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment or gonadal resection&quot;, section on 'Issues in women with breast cancer'</a>.)</p><p>Female cancer survivors who elect in vitro fertilization (IVF) are counseled regarding the options of using autologous or donor oocytes (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oocyte donation for assisted reproduction&quot;</a>). For female cancer survivors diagnosed within the five years prior to undergoing assisted reproductive techniques (ART), use of donor oocytes appears to result in higher live birth rates compared with autologous oocytes. In a population-based cohort study of women undergoing IVF with autologous oocytes within five years of entry into a cancer registry, women with prior cancer treatments (all types) had reductions of greater than 60 percent in pregnancy and live birth rates compared with women without cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Of the cancer survivors, the live birth rate varied from 54 percent for women with melanoma to 14 percent for women with breast cancer (the average live birth rate after IVF for women without cancer was 47 percent). In contrast, when women underwent IVF with donor oocytes, there were no differences in the pregnancy rates regardless of cancer treatment or cancer type. Once women with cancer became pregnant, their likelihood of having a live birth did not differ significantly from women without cancer whether donor or autologous oocytes were used. Of note, women who were diagnosed with breast cancer more than six months prior to ART had a live birth rate similar to the overall live birth rate for women with cancer (23.3 versus 24.7 percent). While more data are needed, this study suggests a negative effect of recent malignancy itself on ART success separate from the negative impact of chemotherapy on ovarian follicles. </p><p>Men with severe oligospermia may require IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Men with azoospermia who did not bank sperm prior to <span class=\"nowrap\">chemotherapy/radiation</span> may have some residual spermatogenesis, so evaluation and possible extraction of testicular sperm (TESE) may be appropriate.

Similar findings have been reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p>In contrast to these generally reassuring studies, at least two studies have observed an increased risk of congenital anomalies in offspring of cancer survivors. One was a relatively small study of survivors of Wilms' tumor treated with radiation therapy that included only 20 malformed infants, suggesting chance may have accounted for the findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The other was a population-based study from Sweden and Denmark restricted to offspring of male cancer survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In this study, offspring of male cancer survivors had a slightly but statistically higher rate of major congenital anomalies than offspring of fathers with no history of cancer (relative risk [RR] 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.31; absolute rate 3.7 versus 3.2 percent). One explanation for these findings, which are discordant with almost all previous studies, is that offspring of cancer survivors were examined more closely because of their paternal history, resulting in ascertainment bias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, growth restriction, stillbirth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (eg, miscarriage, preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth) in female cancer survivors depends, in part, on the type of therapy they received (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery) and to non-treatment factors (eg, age at start of pregnancy, type and site of neoplasm). There is no strong evidence of an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome among female cancer survivors or female partners of male survivors who received chemotherapy for childhood cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/4,26,33,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26,33,35,36</a>].

However, exposing the uterus to high doses of radiation can restrict uterine growth and cause vascular changes that impair uterine blood flow, which may lead to preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/28,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,38-40</a>].</p><p>Cervical surgery for treatment of cervical cancer can affect future risks of miscarriage and preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

This appeared to be due primarily to a higher rate of pregnancy termination, as the rates of miscarriage and stillbirth were generally statistically similar for the survivors and their siblings. In addition, the male:female sex ratio of 1.09:1.0 in offspring of female survivors was similar to that in the general population and in offspring of female siblings of the female survivors, suggesting exposure to mutagenic agents (chemotherapy, radiation therapy) did not increase transmission of lethal X-linked mutations. Lastly, the rate of live birth was not lower for patients treated with any particular drug compared with those not treated with that drug. The most frequently used chemotherapeutic drugs in this study were <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dactinomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dactinomycin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daunorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daunorubicin</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The same investigators also compared pregnancy outcomes in the partners of male survivors of childhood cancer with the outcomes in the partners of their male siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although the proportion of pregnancies that resulted in a live birth was significantly lower for the partners of the male survivors than for the partners of the survivors&rsquo; siblings (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.96), this was due, in part, to a higher rate of pregnancy termination among the partners of male survivors compared with partners of their siblings. The rate of miscarriage was generally similar in both groups, with a possibly higher risk for some individual chemotherapeutic agents, which may have been due to chance. The stillbirth rate and the birth weight distribution were similar in both groups. Interestingly, this study reported a male:female sex ratio of 1.00:1.03, which is lower than that in female cancer survivors and the general population. Possible explanations for this finding are chance and lower testosterone levels from exposure to chemotherapeutic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].

In contrast, girls and young women who undergo pelvic radiation are at risk of developing abnormalities of the pelvic vasculature, which may decrease uteroplacental perfusion; radiation-induced myometrial changes, such as fibrosis, which may decrease uterine elasticity, distensibility, and volume; and injury to the endometrium, which may prevent normal decidualization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors/abstract/46-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-52</a>].

Cryopreservation of embryos or oocytes is a proven approach for fertility preservation, and ovarian function can sometimes be preserved by transposition of gonads. The primary approach to fertility preservation in men is cryopreservation of sperm.

Whether infertility is transient or permanent, and the duration of transient infertility, cannot be predicted reliably, and the presence of functioning gonads does not reliably predict that pregnancy will occur. Fertility potential is assessed in women with tests such as antim&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) level and by semen analysis in men.

(See <a href=\"#H112689416\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of infertility'</a> above.)
