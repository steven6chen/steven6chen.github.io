The immature brain, particularly in the neonate and young infant, differs from the adult brain in the basic mechanisms of epileptogenesis and propagation of seizures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52092\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52092 \">table 1</a>). It is more prone to seizures, but seizures are more apt to disappear as the child grows.</p><p>This topic provides an overview of the classification and etiology of seizures and epilepsy in children.

This abnormal paroxysmal activity is intermittent and usually self-limited, lasting seconds to a few minutes.</p><p>On electroencephalography, a seizure ictus is characterized by sustained, abnormal electrical activity that has a relatively discrete beginning and end, and goes through an evolution characterized by changing morphology and amplitude (voltage) of the abnormal discharges. A focal seizure has a restricted regional onset followed by spread to neighboring or remote brain regions. It may spread to deep subcortical regions and evolve to a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (previously referred to as a secondarily generalized seizure, to differentiate it from seizures that are generalized from the onset) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

It may arise from a variety of genetic, structural, metabolic, immune, infectious, or unknown causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Acute symptomatic seizures (also referred to as provoked or reactive seizures) caused by hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, high fever, toxic exposure, intracranial bleeding, or bacterial meningitis are not classified as epilepsy unless they become a recurrent process beyond the acute illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Clinical seizures are classified on the basis of the individual's ictal behavior with consideration of the electroencephalography (EEG) findings.</p><p>The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification is used by most neurologists to classify seizure types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/1-4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,6,7</a>]. This classification divides seizures into four basic groups based upon clinical and EEG data: focal, generalized, unknown (eg, epileptic spasms), and unclassified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91409 \">table 2</a>). The ILAE classification system is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ILAE classification of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal (partial) seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal seizures originate within networks limited to one hemisphere. They may be discretely localized or more widely distributed. A focal seizure may or may not be associated with impaired awareness during the attack. When the patient is aware throughout the seizure, the seizure is described as a focal seizure without impairment of awareness (previously referred to as simple partial seizure). Focal seizures with impaired awareness correspond to what have previously been called complex partial seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>]. Impaired awareness is defined as the inability to respond normally to exogenous stimuli by virtue of altered awareness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> responsiveness. &quot;Complex&quot; does not refer to the behavior per se, a mistake made by many physicians when describing a focal seizure.</p><p>Focal seizures are further subdivided primarily on the basis of the clinical signs and symptoms and the EEG localization. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor seizures may manifest as focal motor activity, sometimes with an anatomic spread or march of activity (Jacksonian), versive movement (turning of the eyes, head <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trunk), vocalization, or arrest of speech.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory seizures can be manifest by paresthesias, feelings of distortion of an extremity, vertigo, gustatory sensation, olfactory symptoms, auditory symptoms, and visual phenomena such as flashing lights.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic seizures may include an epigastric &quot;rising&quot; sensation (a common aura with medial temporal lobe epilepsy), sweating, piloerection, and pupillary changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal seizures without impairment of awareness may also manifest higher cortical, psychic symptoms including dysphasia, feelings of familiarity (&quot;deja-vu&quot;), distortions of time, affective changes (particularly fear), illusions, and formed hallucinations. Such seizures are often referred to as auras.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During focal seizures with impairment of awareness, the patient may have a variety of repetitive semipurposeful movements that are referred to as motor automatisms. These can include oral-buccal movements (chewing, swallowing, sucking), complex motor phenomena including bicycling and kicking movements, flailing of the arms, and even running, jumping, and spinning. Such seizures involve regions of both hemispheres, thus explaining the impaired awareness and the more complex and often bilateral motor symptomatology.</p><p/><p>Focal seizures may start in a &quot;silent&quot; area of the brain such as the frontal lobe and become clinically apparent only when they spread to neighboring cortex such as the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe or the hippocampus of the temporal lobe. In these cases, the EEG monitoring can be critical to the detection of a focal seizure onset.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generalized seizures can be conceptualized as originating at some point within, and rapidly engaging, bilaterally distributed networks. Awareness may be impaired and this impairment may be the initial manifestation. Motor manifestations are bilateral. The ictal electroencephalographic patterns are bilateral from onset, and presumably reflect neuronal discharge which is widespread in both hemispheres. Generalized seizures can have motor manifestations or they may be absence. Patients with nonmotor seizures, such as absences, may have low amplitude myoclonic movements as well as mild tonic involvement of the limbs and trunk and simple motor automatisms, similar to those seen in focal seizures with impairment of awareness.</p><p>Previously used terminology of seizure classification, &quot;secondary generalized&quot; and &quot;secondarily generalized,&quot; could be confusing and is no longer recognized in the ILAE classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The preferred way to describe a secondarily generalized seizure (ie, one that was known by EEG or by clinical symptoms to begin focally and later generalize) is &quot;focal seizure evolving to a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure.&quot; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2170795316\"><span class=\"h2\">Epileptic spasms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epileptic spasms, which include infantile spasms, are seizures that involve spasms of the muscles of the neck, trunk, and extremities. There is insufficient knowledge about the mode of seizure onset to categorize spasms as focal or generalized at this time, and they are considered of unknown type by the ILAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-infantile-spasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of infantile spasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures in younger children differ significantly from those in older children and adults. Children older than six years tend to have seizures that are quite similar to those of adults, whereas younger children and infants have less complex behaviors, particularly with focal seizures with impairment of awareness. Determination of an alteration of awareness is difficult in infants and young children. In addition, their behaviors during a seizure tend to be less complicated and more fragmented than those in older children. Typical generalized tonic-clonic and absence seizures are extremely uncommon in the first two years of life and never occur in the newborn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These issues, unique to the child between two months and two years, have prompted proposals for classifications specifically directed to this age-group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53102\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53102 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>Children with similar seizure types often share other features, such as age of onset, level of motor and cognitive development, and EEG features, recognizable as a distinctive epilepsy syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. There are nearly 30 epilepsy syndromes recognized by the ILAE, many of which have an onset in childhood or adolescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91410 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ILAE classification of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In population-based studies, incidence rates of epilepsy in childhood range from approximately 0.5 to 8 per 1,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. An estimated 0.5 to 1 percent of children and adolescents will experience at least one afebrile seizure by age adolescence. </p><p>Of all children, 3 to 5 percent will have a single febrile seizure in the first five years of life; 30 percent will have additional febrile seizures, and 3 to 6 percent of those with febrile seizures will develop afebrile seizures or epilepsy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-febrile-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of febrile seizures&quot;</a>). There is a 3.6 percent risk of experiencing at least one seizure in an 80-year lifespan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The highest incidence of epilepsy occurs at the extremes of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The incidence in developed countries is highest in the first few months of life, particularly in the immediate postnatal period, falls significantly after the first year of life, is stable during the first decade, and then falls again in adolescence. Incidence is lowest in young and middle adulthood and begins increasing in the 50s, with a dramatic increase after age 60; by age 70, the incidence exceeds that of infancy. The incidence profile is quite different in developing countries, where the peak in the elderly usually is absent and the highest incidence occurs in young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In most studies, incidence rates are slightly higher in males than in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. No significant racial differences exist. The incidence is higher in lower socioeconomic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Overall incidence figures show that focal (partial) seizures (with or without impairment of awareness) are the most common seizure type in all age groups and account for more than 50 percent of all seizures in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Focal seizures with alterations of awareness are the most common subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Generalized seizures are more common in children than in adults, with generalized tonic-clonic, absence, and myoclonic seizures following focal seizures in frequency of occurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of seizures and epilepsy can be broadly categorized as structural, metabolic, genetic, immune, infectious, and unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ILAE classification of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While some causes of seizures can affect children of any age, others have a predilection for certain age groups. In neonates, for example, most seizures are symptomatic of an identifiable etiology such as neonatal encephalopathy, a metabolic disturbance, or a central nervous system or systemic infection. In older infants and young children, febrile seizures are a common, age-dependent cause of seizure. Likewise, many of the genetic epilepsies tend to present during a relatively narrow age range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91410 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3401763657\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the recognized genetic epilepsies begin in childhood. Genetic epilepsies include the well-characterized epilepsy syndromes of the genetic generalized epilepsies, such as childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, as well as more severe syndromes often associated with neurodevelopmental disability and refractory seizures, such as Dravet syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91410 \">table 4</a>).

Causal mutations were found in 17 percent of patients, and 30 percent of mutations were somatic; mosaicism was common in peripheral blood cells and presumably exists in brain tissue as well. Some of the more commonly identified culprit genes include <em>DCX</em>, <em>LIS1</em>, <em>FLNA</em>, <em>TUBB2B</em>, <em>DYNC1H1</em>, <em>PIK3CA</em>, <em>AKT3</em>, <em>PTEN</em>, and<em> MTOR </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-36</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures are usually stereotyped (each one is like the previous one), random (occur at any time of the day or night), and are rarely precipitated by specific environmental, psychological, or physiological events. Some individuals have several different types of seizures, but most have one type that expresses itself in partial or complete form. As an example, a full seizure may be characterized by flashing lights in one visual field (a focal seizure with occipital lobe onset), followed by eye deviation away from the side of onset (version, caused by spread to the neighboring association cortex), followed by loss of awareness of the surroundings with automatic behavior (motor automatisms such as lip-smacking and swallowing movements) caused by spread to the temporal lobe limbic system of both hemispheres, and a few seconds later culminates in a bilateral convulsive seizure. On some occasions, the patient may experience only the first stage or stages of the seizure with absence of the later stages.</p><p>Only close questioning of the patient or witnesses will uncover the valuable localizing information afforded by the first stages of the ictus, often called the seizure aura. Close questioning of children with a referral diagnosis of &quot;grand mal seizures&quot; may yield information indicating a focal onset. Clinical features of the seizure aura or postictal state are more likely to have precise localizing value than the more dramatic ictal phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>However, exceptions to these basic premises are numerous. Some individuals have seizures only during sleep, others only upon awakening in the morning, others always at the time of menstruation (catamenial seizures), and some following specific stimuli such as certain sounds, flashing lights, stubbing the foot, or being tapped on the shoulder (reflex seizures). The latter seizures (sensory provoked) are rare, but uncovering this information may allow the clinician to classify the child as having a specific epileptic syndrome and develop specific therapy (eg, special glasses with filtered lenses for visually-provoked seizures).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical behavior during seizures and nonepileptic events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some general rules apply to the majority of seizures and provide the information necessary to distinguish true epileptic events from psychogenic nonepileptic events, other paroxysmal behavior or physiological events that may mimic seizures such as those based on cardiovascular dysfunction, and nonepileptic events with a central nervous system origin (eg, paroxysmal dystonia, infantile shuddering attacks, tics).</p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodes of sudden loss of tone with or without loss of consciousness in otherwise healthy children often are cardiogenic in origin. Occasionally, a child with atonic seizures will make a protective move during the fall. However, these seizures usually occur in a neurologically abnormal child (eg, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, other developmental encephalopathies) and are rarely the sole seizure type. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-syndromes-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epilepsy syndromes in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is color change during a seizure, usually a generalized motor seizure, it will be cyanosis. Consider syncope as a cause for the event if the child is described as pale. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of syncope in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consistent crying before a &quot;seizure&quot; is suggestive of a cyanotic breath-holding spell.

Recovery is spontaneous. These are often precipitated by a mild unexpected blow to the head and upper torso and are caused by excessive vagal tone of unknown etiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in infancy&quot;, section on 'Breath-holding spells'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True absence seizures (&quot;petit mal&quot;) cannot be predictably interrupted by calling the child's name or by tactile stimulation, as can the staring spells or behavioral inattentiveness (&quot;spacing out&quot;) commonly seen in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Absence seizures often interrupt conversation or ongoing physical activity such as eating and play, whereas a pseudoabsence of inattention or &quot;daydreaming&quot; tend to occur during more sedentary activity (eg, sitting at a school desk). Absence seizures usually occur multiple times during the day and last only a few (rarely more than 10 to 30) seconds. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Nonepileptic staring spells'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The clinical features of other disorders that can mimic epileptic seizures are discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Focal (partial) seizures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Generalized seizures are those in which the first clinical and electrographic changes indicate initial involvement of both hemispheres. Awareness is impaired and this may be the initial manifestation. Motor manifestations are often bilateral. Seizures can be convulsive and nonconvulsive, depending upon the presence or absence of significant motor concomitants. Patients with nonconvulsive seizures, such as absences, may have low amplitude myoclonic movements as well as mild tonic involvement of the limbs and trunk and simple motor automatisms, similar to those seen in focal seizures with impairment of awareness. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Generalized seizures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Epileptic spasms, which include infantile spasms, are seizures that involve spasms of the muscles of the neck, trunk, and extremities. The mode of onset of epileptic spasms (ie, focal versus generalized) is not well understood. (See <a href=\"#H2170795316\" class=\"local\">'Epileptic spasms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What appears to be a generalized seizure can result from a focal seizure that has rapidly evolved into a bilateral convulsive seizure. The focal onset may not be recognized clinically. Clinical features of the seizure aura or of the postictal state are more likely to have precise localizing value than the more dramatic ictal phenomenon. The EEG typically reveals a focal onset to the seizure or localized spikes between seizures. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of seizures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An estimated 1 percent of children and adolescents in the United States will experience at least one unprovoked seizure by age 14 years. The incidence is highest in the first few months of life, particularly in the immediate postnatal period, falls significantly after the first year of life, is stable during the first decade, and then falls again in adolescence. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiologic classification of seizures and epilepsy includes genetic, <span class=\"nowrap\">structural/metabolic,</span> and unknown categories. <span class=\"nowrap\">Structural/metabolic</span> epilepsy has a known cause; these include vascular, traumatic, developmental, infectious, neoplastic and degenerative diseases; any insult to the cerebral cortex can cause a seizure. Many epilepsy syndromes have a known or presumed genetic component. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures are usually stereotyped (each one is like the previous one), random (occur at any time of the day or night), and are rarely precipitated by specific environmental, psychological, or physiological events. Most patients with loss of consciousness during a seizure awaken slowly and may appear confused or disoriented (postictal state). While there are exceptions, unusual clinical features may suggest the possibility of an alternative diagnosis.
