NSAIDs can induce several different forms of kidney injury including hemodynamically mediated acute kidney injury (AKI); electrolyte and acid-base disorders; acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), which may be accompanied by the nephrotic syndrome; and papillary necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F90018\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90018 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic reviews hemodynamically mediated AKI.

Because of the large number of patients that take NSAIDs (estimates of more than 70 million prescriptions and 30 billion over-the-counter doses annually), this translates to upwards of 2.5 million patients experiencing a nephrotoxic event annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>AKI can occur with any class of traditional, nonselective NSAID or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-specific NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. As an example, in a nested, case-control study that included 121,722 older patients, an increased risk of hospitalization within 30 days was associated with initiation of nonselective NSAIDs (other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>), naproxen, rofecoxib, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> with relative risks (RRs) of 2.3, 2.4, 2.3, and 1.5, respectively, compared with unexposed individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The selective COX-2 inhibitors also decrease renal clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. In a randomized, controlled study, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> and rofecoxib decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR; as measured by inulin or iothalamate clearance) to a similar degree among older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Case reports and case series also show that the selective COX-2 inhibitors have a nephrotoxicity profile similar to traditional NSAIDs, causing AKI, edema, and electrolyte disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555380597\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for NSAID-induced AKI include chronic kidney disease (CKD); volume depletion from aggressive diuresis, vomiting or diarrhea, or effective arterial volume depletion due to heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, or cirrhosis; and severe hypercalcemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F89932\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89932 \">figure 1</a>). Certain medications, including diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), may increase the risk of NSAID-induced AKI.</p><p>Among older patients with CKD, NSAID users are more likely to have deterioration of kidney function over time compared with patients who do not use NSAIDs chronically, and higher doses of NSAIDs are associated with a greater risk of a decline in kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It is not known whether the decline in kidney function among such patients is related to episodes of AKI, however.

This study analyzed NSAID prescribing patterns and eGFR among 1522 patients with CKD stage 3, 4, and 5 before and after implementation of mandatory reporting of eGFR to clinicians. A 10.2 percent reduction in NSAID prescriptions followed reporting of eGFR. The mean eGFR increased from 45.9 to 46.9, 23.9 to 27.1, and 12.4 to 26.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> among patients with eGFRs of 30 to 59, 15 to 29, and &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, after reporting of the eGFR.</p><p>Patients with effective arterial volume depletion due to a condition such as heart failure are also at higher risk for NSAID-induced AKI. This was shown in a nested, case-controlled study that showed that, among 386,916 patients, those who used NSAIDs and had heart failure had a higher risk of AKI compared with those who used NSAIDs but did not have heart failure and compared with those who did not use NSAIDs (relative risks [RRs] of 7.63, 3.34, and 2.82, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs may increase the risk of NSAID-induced hemodynamically mediated AKI. This was suggested in a nested, case-control cohort study in which the concomitant use of such medications was associated with an increased rate of AKI (odds ratio [OR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.12-1.53), with the highest risk within the first 30 days of therapy (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.35-2.46) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Through the enzymatic activity of phospholipase A2, lipids are converted to arachidonic acid (AA), which is converted to a PG or leukotriene precursor in the presence of cyclooxygenase (COX) or lipoxygenase enzymes, respectively. The enzymes responsible for conversion of AA to PG precursors are COX-1 and COX-2. NSAIDs inhibit the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes (although there is enzyme-specific preference amongst traditional NSAIDS and there are specific COX-2 inhibitors). There are five PGs (PGD2, PGE2, PGF2, PGI2, and thromboxane A2) that are synthesized from a common precursor by PG-specific synthases.</p><p>In the kidney, COXs are locally produced at many sites, including glomerular and vascular endothelium, the medullary and cortical collecting tubules, and medullary interstitial cells. COX-1 is expressed ubiquitously in most tissues, while COX-2 expression is low at basal levels but increases with stimulation in the setting of acute or chronic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and other physiologic challenges. The tubules predominantly synthesize PGE2, while the glomeruli synthesize both PGE2 and PGI2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Renal PGs are primarily vasodilators in the kidneys. Under basal conditions, PGs have no significant role in the regulation of renal perfusion. However, in the setting of hypotension and reduced renal perfusion from vasoconstriction stimulated by angiotensin II, norepinephrine, vasopressin, or endothelin, PG synthesis is increased to maintain renal perfusion and minimize ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].</p><p>In addition to modulating renal hemodynamics, PGs also increase renin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], antagonize the water-retentive effects of arginine vasopressin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>], and enhance sodium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAID inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes with subsequent reduction in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis can lead to reversible renal ischemia, a decline in glomerular hydraulic pressure (the major driving force for glomerular filtration), and AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/4,5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,15</a>].</p><p>This occurs via an NSAID-induced attenuation of renal vasodilation. In healthy patients, PGs play little role in renal hemodynamics. However, PG synthesis is increased in the setting of prolonged renal vasoconstriction, which serves to protect the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). PG synthesis is increased in the following conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F90019\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90019 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/4,5,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially stage 3 or worse (ie, estimated GFR [eGFR] &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume depletion from aggressive diuresis, vomiting, or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective arterial volume depletion due to heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, or cirrhosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe hypercalcemia with associated renal arteriolar vasoconstriction</p><p/><p>In these settings, PGs act to preserve renal blood flow and GFR by decreasing preglomerular resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F89933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89933 \">figure 3</a>). This differs from PG function in the setting of glomerular disease, where increased PG production maintains GFR in the presence of a significant reduction in glomerular capillary permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>NSAID-induced inhibition of PG-mediated afferent vasodilation and reduction in peritubular blood flow may also increase the risk of ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or other nephrotoxin-induced tubular injury from drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, hydroxyethyl starch, and radiocontrast material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study showed that, among 38 patients without heart failure who developed contrast nephropathy, 8 percent were prescribed NSAIDs prior to contrast exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535947155\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAID-induced hemodynamically mediated AKI may be prevented by avoiding NSAIDs among high-risk patients (such as those with chronic kidney disease [CKD], volume depletion, heart failure, or hypercalcemia).

For patients with reduced eGFR in whom limited NSAID use is unavoidable (such as those with significant pain or mobility issues in whom other pain medications are significantly less effective), the patient should be advised of the risk, and the creatinine should be followed closely when receiving NSAIDs.</p><p>Despite efforts to minimize use in at-risk patients, many patients with CKD continue to use NSAIDs. In a cross-sectional study of 12,065 adults, chronic NSAID use (as defined as nearly every day for 30 days or longer) was reported among 5 percent of patients with moderate to severe CKD (eGFR of 15 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Awareness of having CKD did not appear to alter NSAID use in this study.</p><p>Clinicians and patients also need to be aware of medications that may increase the risk of hemodynamically mediated AKI when used concomitantly with NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"#H1555380597\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients should not receive NSAIDs prior to procedures involving radiocontrast (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-contrast-nephropathy-associated-with-angiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of contrast nephropathy associated with angiography&quot;</a>) or other nephrotoxic drug administration. In a study cited above, a large number of patients who developed contrast nephropathy had been taking NSAIDs prior to contrast exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The increase in the plasma creatinine concentration usually occurs within the first three to seven days of therapy, which is the time required for attainment of steady-state drug levels and therefore maximum inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, the increase in creatinine may occur at any point.</p><p>Urinalysis is usually negative for hematuria and proteinuria. Although low-level proteinuria (&lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> may be observed, significant proteinuria (ie, &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> is uncommon and suggests an NSAID-induced glomerular lesion (minimal change disease or membranous nephropathy) rather than hemodynamically mediated AKI.</p><p>The urine sediment may contain hyaline casts and, if acute tubular necrosis (ATN) has developed, renal tubular epithelial cell casts, renal tubular epithelial cells, or granular casts. White blood cells (WBCs) and WBC casts are not seen in hemodynamically mediated AKI and suggest acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). (See <a href=\"#H105798836\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6482495\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of hemodynamically mediated AKI associated with NSAIDs is similar to other forms of AKI (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;, section on 'Major causes and pathogenesis of kidney disease'</a>). The diagnosis is suggested by the history of recent NSAID use, the absence of significant proteinuria (&lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> and hematuria and the bland urine sediment.</p><p>Among all patients with AKI, we generally obtain a renal ultrasound to exclude possible obstruction. If the history is overwhelmingly consistent with NSAID initiation or subacute or chronic use, we avoid other costly tests as generally the diagnosis is made when recovery of kidney function occurs after the NSAID is discontinued. The time course to recovery can be dependent on underlying kidney disease and any additional confounding renal injury (such as acute tubular necrosis [ATN]). If injury is truly hemodynamic in nature and due to NSAID use, recovery should begin within 24 to 72 hours. Failure to recover or progression despite removal of NSAIDs should warrant a biopsy within three to seven days, depending on the clinical course. A biopsy may also be done in patients who have features of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) or a glomerular lesion, such as nephrotic-range proteinuria, hematuria with dysmorphic red blood cells, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> red blood cell casts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105798836\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of AKI is broad and is discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;, section on 'Major causes and pathogenesis of kidney disease'</a>). Among patients who present with an increased creatinine in the setting of NSAID use, other NSAID-associated lesions, such as AIN, or an NSAID-related glomerular lesion are among the differential diagnoses. It is important to establish the chronicity of NSAID use and the duration of the increased creatinine, if possible. This is necessary to distinguish between AKI and the more subacute to chronic AIN, which may occur with or without features of nephrotic syndrome.</p><p>The urinalysis and quantitation of proteinuria may distinguish between hemodynamically mediated AKI and AIN. Whereas the urine sediment is generally bland among patients with hemodynamically mediated AKI, urine white blood cells (WBCs) and WBC casts are often observed among patients with AIN. (See <a href=\"#H535946869\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Quantitation of urine protein excretion may differentiate between hemodynamically mediated AKI and an NSAID-induced glomerular lesion such as membranous nephropathy or minimal change disease. As noted above, proteinuria is absent or modest among patients with hemodynamically mediated AKI and generally &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> among patients with a glomerular lesion.</p><p>The urinalysis will also identify patients who have ATN. Among patients with ATN, the sediment may contain renal tubular epithelial cells, renal tubular epithelial cell casts, or muddy brown granular casts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105799091\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of NSAID-associated hemodynamically mediated AKI is no different than other forms of AKI. The offending agent needs to be stopped immediately. Volume resuscitation should be provided in states of hypovolemia and continued based on reassessment of volume status including blood <span class=\"nowrap\">pressure/pulse,</span> urine output, and other parameters. Renal replacement therapy is rarely required but may be needed initially when severe AKI has occurred and there are serious electrolyte and acid-base disturbances present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105799241\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to hemodynamically mediated AKI, it has been proposed that daily NSAID use for a prolonged period of time may be associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), perhaps due to papillary necrosis or chronic interstitial nephritis similar to that seen with other analgesics.

Medications including diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of NSAID-induced AKI.

The chronic use of NSAIDs should be avoided if at all possible among patients with a reduced eGFR (eGFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and used cautiously, even if the reduction is mild (ie, eGFR 60 to 89 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>). For patients with reduced eGFR in whom limited NSAID use is unavoidable (such as those with significant pain or mobility issues in whom other pain medications are significantly less effective), the patient should be advised of the risk, and the creatinine should be followed closely when receiving NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"#H535947155\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients generally present with an incidentally detected increase in the plasma creatinine. Urinalysis is usually negative for hematuria and proteinuria. The urine sediment may contain hyaline casts and, if acute tubular necrosis (ATN) has developed, renal tubular epithelial cell casts, renal tubular epithelial cells, or granular casts. White blood cells (WBCs) and WBC casts are not seen in hemodynamically mediated AKI and suggest acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). (See <a href=\"#H6482495\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among all patients with AKI, we generally obtain a renal ultrasound to exclude possible obstruction. If the history is overwhelmingly consistent with NSAID initiation or subacute or chronic use, we avoid other costly tests as generally the diagnosis is made when recovery of kidney function occurs after the NSAID is discontinued. Failure to recover within three to seven days or progression despite removal of NSAIDs should warrant a biopsy. A biopsy may also be done in patients who have features of AIN or a glomerular lesion, such as nephrotic-range proteinuria or hematuria with dysmorphic red blood cells or red blood cell casts. (See <a href=\"#H6482495\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of NSAID-induced AKI is similar to that of other forms of AKI. The NSAID should be stopped immediately. Volume resuscitation should be provided in states of hypovolemia and continued based on reassessment of volume status including blood <span class=\"nowrap\">pressure/pulse,</span> urine output, and other parameters. Renal replacement therapy is rarely required but may be needed initially when severe AKI has occurred and there are serious electrolyte and acid-base disturbances present. (See <a href=\"#H105799091\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Whelton A.
