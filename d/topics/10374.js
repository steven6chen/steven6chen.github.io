The prevalence of pain has been associated with substantially lower health-related quality of life and greater psychosocial distress, insomnia, and depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>]. Many analgesics that are typically used in the non-CKD population should not be used among CKD patients. This topic reviews the management of chronic pain among CKD patients.</p><p>The evaluation and management of pain in the general adult population is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of chronic pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624275934\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is more prevalent among CKD patients than in the general population. Over 60 percent of hemodialysis patients describe moderate or severe chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. By contrast, according to a national survey, approximately 19 percent of adults in the United States (both with and without CKD) have reported chronic pain, although prevalence rates increase with age and peak in adults aged 60 to 69 years at 29.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Most studies of CKD patients have included only hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A few small studies have suggested that pain is as common among peritoneal dialysis patients and stage 5 CKD patients who are not on dialysis as among chronic hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>Very few studies have reported the prevalence of pain among patients with earlier stages of CKD. A single, small study of 130 nondialysis CKD patients with varying severity of CKD suggested that the prevalence of pain was similar (64 to 75 percent) among all levels of CKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, it is not clear that patients included in this study are representative of CKD patients in the general population, since all patients in this study were drawn from a CKD clinic; many individuals with mild declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; ie, 60 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) are not followed in CKD clinics.</p><p>Most studies in CKD patients show no association of chronic pain with sex, age, race, or ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624275946\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF PAIN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H513528797\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both dialysis and nondialysis CKD patients should be routinely screened for the presence of pain since pain is highly prevalent and associated with diminished quality of life and other symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1-9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9,16</a>]. The reason for screening is that pain may be successfully treated if it is identified and sufficiently characterized by the care provider. In addition, the routine assessment of pain often provides an opportunity for difficult discussions about appropriate palliative- and supportive-care options.</p><p>There are at least eight validated symptom assessment tools designed to identify CKD patients with chronic pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F100576\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100576 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1,2,11,17-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,11,17-23</a>]. Tools such as the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System Revised: Renal (ESAS-r:Renal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1,2,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,24</a>] and Palliative Care Outcome Scale-Renal (POS-renal) are particularly useful for routine clinical screening for pain in kidney programs because they are short, relatively simple to complete by the patient, and require minimal facilitation from staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17</a>].</p><p>The use of these screening tools also allows for the assessment of other bothersome symptoms that often accompany pain, such as depression, anxiety, itch, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, shortness of breath, and poor sleep.</p><p>We use the ESAS-r:Renal to screen CKD patients for pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F104715\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef104715 \">form 1</a>). We integrate routine screening of hemodialysis patients during monthly assessments. We screen home dialysis patients and predialysis CKD patients quarterly at the time of clinic visits.</p><p>Once pain is identified, it should be further evaluated as to cause. Depending on the cause of pain, a specific intervention or pharmacologic treatment may be indicated. As an example, the patient with vascular steal syndrome may require a surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access#H12722337\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonthrombotic complications of arteriovenous hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Extremity ischemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications#H1936474493\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous graft creation for hemodialysis and its complications&quot;, section on 'Access flow-related problems'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H513528803\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CKD patients are vulnerable to all the causes of pain that affect the general population. In addition, CKD patients may experience pain related to their primary kidney disease (eg, polycystic kidney disease), comorbid conditions (eg, diabetic neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease), or sequelae of CKD (such as calcific uremic arteriolopathy [calciphylaxis], bone pain from renal osteodystrophy, and dialysis-related amyloid arthropathy). Most studies have not shown an association of pain with the biochemical derangements common in CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>]. However, a single but large study of 1469 patients showed that, among dialysis patients, disturbed metabolism of calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone is associated with more muscle, joint, and bone pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Pain may also be directly or indirectly related to dialysis. Painful conditions may be related to the dialysis access. As examples, arteriovenous fistulas can lead to painful ischemic neuropathies, and tunneled catheters may result in painful, chronic infections such as osteomyelitis and discitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access#H12722337\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonthrombotic complications of arteriovenous hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Extremity ischemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tunneled, cuffed hemodialysis catheter-related bacteremia&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications#H1936474493\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous graft creation for hemodialysis and its complications&quot;, section on 'Access flow-related problems'</a>.)</p><p>Pain may also be directly related to the dialysis treatment; hemodialysis patients often experience recurrent cramps or headaches during their dialysis treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and peritoneal dialysis patients may have pain due to abdominal distension, recurrent peritonitis, and lower back strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Pain is generally classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is usually due to tissue injury. Causes of nociceptive pain common to CKD patients include (but are not limited to) osteoarthritis, renal osteodystrophy, dialysis-related amyloid arthropathy, and kidney or liver capsule distension from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). All can cause mild, moderate, or severe pain. (See <a href=\"#H1838178070\" class=\"local\">'Nociceptive pain'</a> below.)</p><p>Neuropathic pain arises from abnormal neural activity secondary to disease, injury, or dysfunction of the nervous system (see <a href=\"#H1239487165\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathic pain'</a> below). Common examples of neuropathic pain among CKD patients include but are not limited to diabetic neuropathy, phantom limb pain, and carpel tunnel syndrome.</p><p>Among CKD patients, the pain is often mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">nociceptive/neuropathic</span> in nature. (See <a href=\"#H1838178192\" class=\"local\">'Mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pain'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1239486792\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the general adult population, treatment options for chronic pain fall into six major categories: pharmacologic, physical medicine, behavioral medicine, neuromodulation, interventional, and surgical approaches. Optimal patient outcomes often result from multiple approaches utilized in concert and coordinated by a multidisciplinary team of pain specialists. Medication is not the sole focus of treatment but is used when needed, in conjunction with other treatment modalities, to meet treatment goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain#H185827432\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Approach to the patient'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H513529680\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpharmacologic treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacologic modalities are generally the same among CKD patients as in the general population and are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic therapies'</a>). However, frailty or general disability may prevent some patients from benefiting fully from physical interventions. In addition, behavioral approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may be challenging and possibly less effective for some CKD patients, especially those already on dialysis, because of the time and cognitive ability required. Regardless, where available, these modalities should be tried.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194433508\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our pharmacologic approach is based upon the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder, which uses a stepwise approach to prescribing analgesic agents according to pain severity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63298 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. According to the WHO analgesic ladder, mild pain is treated with nonopioid analgesic agents (tier 1), moderate pain is treated with a weak opioid with or without a nonopioid agent (tier 2), and severe pain is treated with a strong opioid (tier 3) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63298 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F100573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100573 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, the WHO ladder is modified for CKD patients since many specific agents (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>) should not be used for individuals with a severely reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F100573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100573 \">table 2</a>). Systematic reviews for nonmalignant chronic pain have supported use of the WHO analgesic ladder approach in the general [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/31-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-37</a>] and geriatric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>] populations. Most palliative care consensus groups with expertise in caring for CKD patients advocate for this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,26,29,40-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26,29,40-54</a>]. However, no good studies have examined the effect of treatment algorithms on clinically important outcomes such as pain, overall symptom burden, and quality of life of CKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194433521\"><span class=\"h3\">Principles for dosing and administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general principles of the pharmacologic treatment of pain are the same for CKD patients as for the general population.</p><p>These include the following principles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F100572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100572 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>By mouth &ndash;</strong> The safest route of administration is oral. However, consideration should also be given to effectiveness, patient comfort, and patient control. For example, if ingestion or absorption of the medication is uncertain, analgesia needs to be given by an alternative route such as transdermal, subcutaneous, or rectal routes. Although hemodialysis patients have easy intravenous access, intravenous administration should be avoided as the route of administration of analgesic agents for chronic pain in order to optimize safety and minimize the risk of addiction and abuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>By the clock</strong> &ndash; Analgesics given for moderate to severe pain are given on a fixed-dose schedule around the clock and not only on an &quot;as needed&quot; or &quot;prn&quot; basis. This allows for more consistent pain relief. Patients given scheduled analgesics are more comfortable and use less medication overall. Some patients with mild pain may achieve adequate pain relief with analgesic dosing post-hemodialysis only. An example is CKD patients with mild neuropathic pain, which may be adequately controlled with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> postdialysis. (See <a href=\"#H1239487165\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathic pain'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>By the ladder</strong> &ndash; A stepwise approach is recommended, in which medications are added sequentially. For CKD patients, it is important to select analgesic agents carefully, depending on the eGFR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>For the individual</strong> &ndash; There is a great deal of interpatient variability in the response to analgesic agents. The maximal dose varies by patient and is identified by the amount needed to relieve the pain without producing intolerable side effects. Since there are no studies on the long-term use of analgesics in patients with CKD, careful attention must be paid to issues of efficacy and safety, and close monitoring is essential.</p><p/><p>By using this approach, pain can be controlled safely in most patients with CKD, including those with advanced CKD and those on dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194433578\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The analgesic choice for individual CKD patients depends on at least three variables:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The nature of the pain &ndash;</strong> For all patients, the choice of analgesic agent for individual patients depends in part on the nature of the pain. Pain is generally classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is usually due to tissue injury (see <a href=\"#H1838178070\" class=\"local\">'Nociceptive pain'</a> below). Neuropathic pain arises from abnormal neural activity secondary to disease, injury, or dysfunction of the nervous system (see <a href=\"#H1239487165\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathic pain'</a> below). Among CKD patients, the pain is often mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">nociceptive/neuropathic</span> in nature. (See <a href=\"#H1838178192\" class=\"local\">'Mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pain'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The severity of pain &ndash; </strong>Patients who present with severe pain may require the initiation of stronger agents at the outset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The severity of kidney dysfunction</strong> &ndash; Many analgesic agents should have dose reductions or should not be used among individuals with advanced kidney dysfunction (defined as eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, including those on dialysis). This is because the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many analgesics and most opioids are altered among such patients, and the risk of toxicity from accumulation of renally excreted drugs and their metabolites is high. The optimal agents for patients with more moderate CKD, such as those with eGFR &gt;30 to 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, are not known, as studies have not been performed in this population. Except for the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), which are believed to potentially worsen CKD, we generally treat patients with eGFR &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> as we treat the general population. (See <a href=\"#H458640372\" class=\"local\">'Drugs that should be avoided'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The optimal analgesic agents for CKD patients are indicated in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F100573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100573 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Suggested dose reductions are based on both clinical experience and available data. Pharmacokinetic data on analgesic medications in the context of CKD are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F103959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103959 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>However, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of analgesics in CKD remain limited, and the level of evidence for use of individual analgesics varies considerably. Most pharmacokinetic studies have not been designed to evaluate efficacy and safety and are typically small, single-dose studies or studies over very short periods of time of patients with varying degrees of kidney function. Only a few studies have provided information regarding clinically relevant outcomes such as analgesic effect or adverse effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194433596\"><span class=\"h3\">Specific pain syndromes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1838178070\"><span class=\"h4\">Nociceptive pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of nociceptive pain common to CKD patients include (but are not limited to) osteoarthritis, renal osteodystrophy, dialysis-related amyloid arthropathy, and kidney or liver capsule distension from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). All can cause mild, moderate, or severe pain. Below is presented an approach to mild, moderate, and severe nociceptive pain, based upon the WHO analgesic ladder and modified or reduced eGFR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F104061\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104061 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H513530335\"><span class=\"h5\">Acetominophen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a>, prescribed in standard doses, is the first-line analgesic for CKD patients with nociceptive pain. Acetaminophen is extensively metabolized in the liver, and only 2 to 5 percent of the therapeutic dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Acetaminophen elimination is not significantly reduced among patients with decreased eGFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-pain-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. If therapeutic doses are used, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the chronic use of acetaminophen in therapeutic doses causes or worsens CKD. Thus, we feel that, in the presence of pain, it is relatively safe to give up to a full dose of acetaminophen to patients with advanced CKD.</p><p>For patients who do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> alone, either an opioid or a nonopioid agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>, may be added to acetaminophen. Although the WHO analgesic ladder for the non-CKD population suggests a weak opioid such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a> for moderate pain (ie, tier 2), there is no good weak opioid for CKD patients. Codeine should not be used among CKD patients (at least among those with eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>).

Many analgesics that are typically used in the non-CKD population should not be used among CKD patients. (See <a href=\"#H1838178710\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H624275934\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CKD patients are vulnerable to all the causes of pain that affect the general population. In addition, CKD patients may have pain related to their primary renal disease or related to dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H513528803\" class=\"local\">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both dialysis and nondialysis CKD patients should be routinely screened for pain. We screen patients for pain using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System Revised: Renal (ESAS-r:Renal) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F104715\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef104715 \">form 1</a>). We screen hemodialysis patients monthly and home dialysis patients and predialysis CKD patients quarterly. (See <a href=\"#H624275946\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As for the general adult population, treatment options for chronic pain include pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Nonpharmacologic modalities are generally the same among CKD patients as in the general population, although patients are often too frail to benefit fully from physical interventions. Behavioral approaches may be challenging and possibly less effective for some CKD patients. (See <a href=\"#H1239486792\" class=\"local\">'Treatment overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nociceptive pain is usually due to tissue injury. Causes of nociceptive pain common to CKD patients include (but are not limited to) osteoarthritis, renal osteodystrophy, dialysis-related amyloid arthropathy, and kidney or liver capsule distension from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We suggest the following approach, which is based upon clinical experience and expert opinion rather than well-designed clinical trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F104061\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104061 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We initiate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> alone, either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a> or a low dose of a strong opioid may be added to acetaminophen. There is no good weak opioid for CKD patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preferred opioids include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathic pain arises from abnormal neural activity secondary to disease, injury, or dysfunction of the nervous system. Common examples of neuropathic pain among CKD patients include diabetic neuropathy, phantom limb pain, and carpel tunnel syndrome. We suggest the following approach, which is based upon clinical experience and expert opinion rather than well-designed clinical trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F104062\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104062 \">algorithm 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We initiate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> and then follow a step-up treatment, adding or switching to a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and then adding analgesics as described above.
