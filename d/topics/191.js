A common clinical manifestation in affected patients is a hemorrhagic diathesis. The natural history and management of these inhibitors are quite different from inhibition due to alloantibodies that occur in patients with various inherited bleeding disorders (eg, congenital deficiencies of factors VIII, IX, or XI) treated with factor replacement. Acquired coagulation inhibitors that lead to bleeding will be reviewed here. Inhibitors in patients with hemophilia and factor XI deficiency are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factor VIII and factor IX inhibitors in patients with hemophilia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-xi-deficiency#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factor XI deficiency&quot;, section on 'FXI inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some disorders may be associated with antibodies to a variety of clotting factors. In systemic lupus erythematosus, for example, antiphospholipid antibodies and antibodies directed against factors II, VIII, IX, XI, XII, and XIII have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of conditions associated with antiphospholipid antibodies are discussed elsewhere in UpToDate.

Although there are no large series describing the immunoglobulin class of the factor VIII autoantibodies, most have been IgG antibodies that do not bind complement.</p><p>The reasons for the production of factor VIII autoantibodies in a particular individual are not clear, but may involve the presence of certain gene polymorphisms (eg, HLA, CTLA4) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autoreactive CD4+ T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>An individual patient, either nonhemophilic or hemophilic, can produce antibodies of different IgG subclasses directed against different epitopes on the factor VIII molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. However, the production of multiple antibodies is much more common in patients with hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Most of these antibodies bind to the C2 or, less often, the A2 domain on factor VIII [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Loss of the C2 domain, which binds to the procoagulant phospholipid phosphatidylserine on activated platelets and endothelial cells and to von Willebrand factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], leads to reduced procoagulant activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

In another survey of 118 physicians likely to see such patients, 215 were described over a 10-year period; the following characteristics were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most of the patients were over age 50, except for women who were pregnant or postpartum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major identifiable causes were pregnancy or the postpartum period, rheumatoid arthritis, malignancy, systemic lupus erythematosus, and drug reactions (each responsible for 5 to 10 percent). However, in almost one-half of the patients no underlying disorder was present.</p><p/><p>A meta-analysis of series and surveys of patients with acquired factor VIII inhibitors, including the author's own experience, and comprising 249 patients, was published in 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Median age was 64 (range: 8 to 93); 55 percent were female. Median inhibitor and factor VIII levels were 10 Bethesda units (range: 0.9 to 32,000) and 2 percent (range: 0 to 30), respectively. The most common associated conditions were malignancy, post-partum status, and autoimmune disorders. On multivariate analysis, factors predicting for improved overall survival were attainment of complete remission, age &lt;65, and post-partum status. Although treatment data appeared to suffer from publication bias, the highest rates of complete remission and lowest rates of disease-specific mortality were noted in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>.</p><p>In 2012, a large prospective study detailed the demographics and clinical characteristics of 501 European patients who presented between 2003 and 2008; findings were consistent with the earlier meta-analysis of smaller studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postpartum</strong> &ndash; Several retrospective studies and reviews of acquired factor VIII inhibitors associated with pregnancy have come to similar conclusions regarding the course and prognosis of these inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/2,3,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,24-26</a>]. The inhibitors are typically diagnosed within two to three months postpartum. Most cases were associated with the first pregnancy (ie, in primigravidas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The survival of patients with pregnancy associated factor VIII inhibitors is nearly 100 percent, substantially better than that of patients with these inhibitors not associated with pregnancy. This excellent survival might reflect the younger age, overall better health, and reversibility of the condition that provoked the development of the inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

In a review of 27 analyzable cases, there was a close temporal relationship between detection of the inhibitors and diagnosis of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There was no association with a specific tumor; the possible causative role of treatment with immunomodulatory agents (eg, interferon, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>) is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a second review of 41 patients identified through the available literature, there were 25 with solid organ tumors and 16 with hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Adenocarcinomas comprised 64 percent of the solid tumors, with the most common sites being prostate and lung. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was the most common of the hematologic malignancies. The median age was 70 and 68 percent of the subjects were men. Treatment of the inhibitor led to a complete response (CR) in 70 percent of patients. Patients achieving CR were more likely to have early stage tumors and a lower median inhibitor titer at the time of presentation, compared with nonresponders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug-induced</strong> &ndash; Anti-factor VIII antibodies have been associated some medications (eg, penicillin, sulfamides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>) and immunomodulatory agents such as interferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/4,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,38</a>]. These antibodies often resolve following cessation of the offending drug.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of acquired factor VIII antibodies is bleeding that, in some cases, is first noted after a surgical procedure. However, most occur spontaneously without apparent provocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Symptomatic patients often present with large hematomas, extensive ecchymoses or severe mucosal bleeding, including epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and gross hematuria. Spontaneous hemarthroses, which are common in hereditary factor VIII deficiency, are unusual in those with acquired disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The range of bleeding manifestations can be illustrated by observations in women with postpartum factor VIII inhibitors. Soft tissue bleeding was most common (29 of 51 patients), followed by muscle, vaginal, joint bleeding, and hematuria (13 to 18 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There were no episodes of intracerebral bleeding.</p><p>Bleeding is often severe, constituting a <strong>medical emergency</strong>. In the above survey of 215 patients, 87 percent experienced major bleeding and 22 percent died from complications attributed directly or indirectly to the inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the United Kingdom cohort, bleeding was the cause of death in 9 percent and remained a risk until the inhibitor had been eradicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A significant number of patients have repeat bleeding after initial therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sudden presence of large hematomas or extensive ecchymoses in an elderly individual without significant trauma or known bleeding disorder should always raise the clinical suspicion of an acquired factor VIII inhibitor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Coagulation tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the clinical features, factor VIII inhibitors are characterized by a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and a normal prothrombin time (PT). The differential diagnosis of this profile in a patient with a bleeding diathesis includes deficiencies of factors XI, IX or VIII, von Willebrand disease, inhibitors of these factors, and the use of heparin&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79969 \">table 2</a>) A prolonged aPTT is also seen in the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, but these patients typically present with thrombosis rather than bleeding episodes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A reasonable first step is to exclude the use of heparin as a cause of the patient's bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolongation of the aPTT. In addition to a review of the patient's medications, the presence of heparin in the blood sample can be suspected via one of the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;, section on 'Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The simplest approach is to redraw a blood sample using an uncontaminated peripheral vein.

In this assay, varying amounts of patient plasma and pooled normal plasma are mixed and the aPTT measured. After mixing, measurement of the aPTT should be performed not only immediately but also after incubation at 37&ordm;C for one to two hours. The second measurement is necessary to detect factor VIII inhibitors with slow reaction kinetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Correction of the prolonged aPTT suggests a factor deficiency or VWD, while persistent prolongation of the aPTT indicates the presence of an inhibitor. The mixing test will establish whether an inhibitor is present but will not identify the inhibitor's specificity.</p><p>The next step is adding a source of phospholipid to the mixed plasma. Correction of the aPTT suggests the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. If the aPTT does not correct, the Bethesda assay is performed. The Bethesda assay both establishes the diagnosis of a factor VIII inhibitor and quantifies the antibody titer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. By standardizing the strength of factor VIII inhibitors, this assay also permits comparison between different treatment regimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Bethesda assay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the Bethesda assay, serial dilutions of patient plasma are incubated with pooled normal plasma at 37&ordm;C for two hours; factor VIII activity is then measured using a clotting assay as one would in a patient with hereditary factor VIII deficiency. The reciprocal dilution of patient plasma that results in 50 percent factor VIII activity is defined as one Bethesda unit (BU).

Most inhibitors disappear within a period of months; it is not clear if immunosuppressive therapy accelerates this response.</p><p>Treatment modalities for acutely bleeding patients include platelet transfusions, plasma exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>], and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>]. For serious bleeding, we suggest the use of platelet transfusions and plasma exchange; such patients should also receive immunosuppressive therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, as described above in patients with factor VIII inhibitors; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> has also been used successfully in a few patients with acquired factor V inhibitors refractory to other therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].

As expected, the PT is prolonged but the aPTT is normal, since factor VII is not involved in either the intrinsic coagulation pathway or the final common pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79969 \">table 2</a>).

These patients have presented with the sudden onset of bleeding, prolonged PT and aPTT measurements, and transient, severe deficiency of factor X. There was often an antecedent acute respiratory infection, and inhibitors were not conclusively demonstrated.</p><p>Amyloidosis can lead to deficiency of factor X due to binding of the protein to amyloid fibrils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/121-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-123</a>].

Affected patients usually have little or no bleeding despite a prolonged aPTT that does not fully correct in a mixing study. The relative lack of bleeding, which is also noted in congenital factor XI deficiency, probably reflects the tertiary role for factor XI in factor X activation, although bleeding can occur under certain circumstances.

Factor XIII inhibitors, which are exceedingly rare, can act by one of several mechanisms: inhibition of activation of factor XIII; interference with enzymatic function; or prevention of binding to fibrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/127-129\" class=\"abstract_t\">127-129</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H4210635\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Continuation of the coagulation cascade'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical hallmark of a factor XIII inhibitor is delayed bleeding after surgery or an invasive procedure, since the initial clot which does form is mechanically weak and unstable. Large spontaneous hematomas or intracranial hemorrhage can occur. Most patients are over age 50, and death from bleeding is not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/127,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,130</a>]. As an example, in a review of 33 cases, nine died of hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].</p><p>Factor XIII inhibitors can be associated with immune dysregulation. In one review, development of an anti-factor XIII antibody was associated with systemic lupus erythematosus in a third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].

The PT and aPTT, which measure fibrin generation, are normal, but the clot stability assay is abnormal, since the absence of fibrin crosslinking causes the clot to lyse much more rapidly in 5 molar urea, 2 percent acetic acid, or 1 percent monochloroacetic acid. In one review, clot solubility testing was used to make the diagnosis in half of the patients, with the remainder diagnosed by a variety of other tests (eg, Berichrom FXIII, which is a photometric assay for quantitative measurement of FXIII level) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].

Antibodies to factor VIII are the most common, and their treatment has been more extensively studied than that of other acquired inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Factor VIII inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired antibodies to the clotting factors are often diagnosed by mixing studies, in which addition of patient plasma to normal plasma causes the relevant clotting test to become abnormal due to the antibody. The clotting tests affected by each type of inhibitor are discussed above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common conditions associated with the development of acquired <strong>factor VIII</strong> inhibitors are rheumatic diseases, the postpartum period, malignancy, and some drugs. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with <strong>factor VIII inhibitors </strong>who have active bleeding, we suggest initial control of active bleeding using an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prothrombin-complex-concentrate-activated-from-human-plasma-factor-eight-inhibitor-bypassing-activity-feiba-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">activated prothrombin complex concentrate</a> (aPCC; eg, factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity [FEIBA]) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viia-activated-recombinant-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human factor VIIa</a> (rFVIIa) rather than a human factor VIII product (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This applies to inhibitors of any titer. Human factor VIII generally cannot be given in high enough amounts to overcome the inhibitor. Recombinant porcine factor VIIIa is also an option. The choice of product depends on availability, initial or previous responses, and clinician preference. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Control of active bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To eliminate <strong>factor VIII</strong> inhibitors we recommend the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at an initial oral dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in all patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Based upon weak evidence from the literature and our own experience, we suggest that oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) be added to the initial prednisone treatment regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Eliminating the inhibitor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibitors of <strong>prothrombin</strong> are frequently associated with antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment of active bleeding is done with fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Modalities associated with factor VIII antibodies may also be useful. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Prothrombin (factor II) inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of factor VIII inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibitors of <strong>thrombin</strong> can develop in patients exposed to bovine thrombin, or in patients with autoimmune diseases. Antibodies provoked by exposure to exogenous thrombin do not always cause bleeding, while those associated with autoimmune disease can cause severe bleeding. Although only anecdotal information is available for treatment, we suggest immunosuppression and aggressive initial management including plasma exchange (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibitors of <strong>factor V</strong> tend to arise after exposure to exogenous clotting products such as thrombin glue. The clinical phenotype can be quite variable. For serious bleeding, we suggest the use of platelet transfusions and plasma exchange; such patients should also receive immunosuppressive therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Factor V inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibitors of <strong>factors VII, IX, X, XI, and XIII</strong> are exceedingly rare. Suggested treatment for these conditions includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Infusion of coagulation factor concentrates, where available (eg, factor XI and factor XIII) may also be helpful.
