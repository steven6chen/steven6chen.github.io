KD also occurs rarely in adults. It is typically a self-limited condition, with fever and manifestations of acute inflammation lasting for an average of 12 days without therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, complications such as coronary artery (CA) aneurysms may develop and lead to significant morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Children suspected of having KD who do not fulfill diagnostic criteria (ie, have fever &ge;5 days but less than four signs of mucocutaneous inflammation) may have incomplete or atypical KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. &quot;Incomplete KD&quot; is the preferred term since these patients do not appear to differ from those with classic KD in any way except that they lack a sufficient number of criteria to fulfill the epidemiologic case definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Children with incomplete KD are also at risk for cardiovascular sequelae.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and criteria for treatment of incomplete KD are discussed in this review. Unique features in infants and adults are also presented. Other aspects of KD are reviewed separately.

In a retrospective report of 242 Japanese children with KD treated at a single center over a nine-year period, 10 percent of patients were diagnosed with incomplete KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence appears to be greater in infants younger than six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This was illustrated in a retrospective review of 44 children with KD. Five of 11 infants (45 percent) had incomplete disease compared with 4 of 33 (12 percent) older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. KD occurs rarely in adults and presents in an incomplete form more often than in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2509270\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF TYPICAL VERSUS INCOMPLETE KD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms appear to parallel those in children who fulfill diagnostic criteria for typical disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67711 \">table 1</a>) when clinical judgment of reliable observers is used to define incomplete KD. Fever for five or more days is the one common finding. However, fever may be absent or missed in some infants. Patients with incomplete KD have less than four signs of mucocutaneous inflammation. Some infants present only with fever and no other clinical features of KD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"#H607415436\" class=\"local\">'Infants'</a> below.)</p><p>One report studied 242 patients hospitalized for KD in Japan during a nine-year period and found that 25 (10 percent) ultimately failed to meet diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Three criteria were met in 17 of the 25 patients (68 percent), and 7 (28 percent) met only two criteria. Only one patient ultimately developed transient dilatation of a coronary artery (CA). In this review, comparison of physical findings among patients with typical and incomplete KD revealed the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical lymphadenopathy was the cardinal manifestation most often absent in children with either complete or incomplete KD.

In a retrospective Taiwanese study of 120 patients with KD that included 20 infants &le;6 months of age, for example, the infants were more likely to present with incomplete KD than patients older than six months of age (35 versus 12 percent), have CA involvement (65 versus 19 percent), and receive late immunoglobulin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607415512\"><span class=\"h2\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one-fourth of adult KD cases have occurred in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One review found that cervical lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, and arthralgia were all more common in adults with KD than in children, and meningitis, thrombocytosis, and CA aneurysms were less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A subsequent review of 43 adult patients with KD in France, which excluded cases associated with HIV, found more sobering outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The median time to diagnosis was 13 days, and morbidity was correspondingly high: 26 percent of patients demonstrated CA vasculitis, 19 percent had CA aneurysms, and 9 percent had a myocardial infarction. Patients diagnosed before day 10, however, had outcomes similar to those seen in children. In a separate case report, splenomegaly and elevated serum ferritin levels were reported in one adult patient, most likely due to macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) complicating KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-complications#H1305931109\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Complications&quot;, section on 'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2509277\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF INCOMPLETE KD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of incomplete KD is problematic because the correct diagnosis rests upon clinical judgment and supportive laboratory findings but remains uncertain unless the child develops coronary artery (CA) abnormalities. However, the goal of adding this category of patients was to help providers identify children at risk of developing CA abnormalities who would benefit from treatment for KD regardless of whether they meet diagnostic criteria. As such, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have created an algorithm for the evaluation of incomplete KD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F115617\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115617 \">algorithm 1</a>) that uses laboratory studies and echocardiography to aid in the diagnosis of patients whose clinical presentation is consistent with KD but who do not meet diagnostic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67711 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients who do not initially meet diagnostic criteria for typical or incomplete KD should be reevaluated if they have persistent fever. At any point in the evaluation, consultation with an expert is recommended if assistance is required or the diagnosis is in question. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H26262883\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Laboratory findings'</a>.)</p><p>Incomplete KD should be suspected and laboratory evaluation performed in patients less than six months of age with unexplained fever &ge;7 days, even if they have no clinical findings of KD, and in patients of any age with unexplained fever &ge;5 days and only two or three clinical criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67711 \">table 1</a>). Other illnesses associated with fever, rash, and similar laboratory abnormalities must be carefully excluded before the label of incomplete KD is applied. Children with a variety of inflammatory and infectious conditions, including adenovirus, atypical measles, sarcoid, polyarteritis nodosa, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, have been mislabeled as having incomplete KD prior to establishment of the correct diagnosis. The main diagnoses to exclude in adults are drug hypersensitivity reactions and toxic shock syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Echocardiographic abnormalities suggestive of KD include CA aneurysms (unusual before 10 days of disease), findings consistent with coronary arteritis (eg, CA Z-score &gt;2.5 and lack of tapering of the CAs), decreased left ventricular contractility, mild valvular regurgitation (primarily mitral valve), and pericardial effusion.

In one study, only children with KD had CA Z-scores &gt;2.5, suggesting that this cutoff is a reliable marker of KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2509298\"><span class=\"h1\">CRITERIA FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) criteria to diagnose incomplete KD and initiate treatment include clinical features compatible with KD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F115617\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115617 \">algorithm 1</a>). Most commonly, such children have fever for at least five days, two or three additional clinical criteria, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67711 \">table 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Intravenous immune globulin'</a>.)</p><p>Features increasing the likelihood that such a child has incomplete KD that would benefit from IVIG therapy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three or more abnormal supplemental laboratory findings (see <a href=\"#H2509284\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">OR</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal echocardiography (see <a href=\"#H2509291\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">OR</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever for seven or more days, <strong>even without supportive clinical or laboratory findings</strong>, in a child under six months of age who is felt to be more likely to have KD than any alternative diagnosis</p><p/><p>This determination is best made by a clinician experienced in the diagnosis and management of KD so as to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. The above recommendations are based upon clinical criteria and reflect the consensus of experts in the field, although they are not based upon firm data and have not been validated. Ultimately, they reflect a bias in favor of treatment in uncertain cases that has developed as a result of the availability of an effective and safe therapy. As such, children with a variety of other febrile conditions may end up receiving IVIG treatment using these guidelines. However, the presence of a concurrent viral respiratory infection does not exclude the diagnosis of KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Treatment of KD is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treating children at risk even though the diagnosis is uncertain should result in fewer children with incomplete KD subsequently developing coronary artery (CA) aneurysms. This was demonstrated in a study that evaluated the performance of the 2004 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/AAP</span> criteria in 195 children at four centers, 58 of whom developed CA aneurysms despite failing to meet criteria for KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Fifty-three of these children had incomplete KD and would have received IVIG at presentation according to the 2004 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/AAP</span> guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Two of the remaining five patients would have received IVIG after further monitoring. Overall, application of the 2004 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/AAP</span> guidelines would have led to IVIG treatment of 97 percent of the children who developed aneurysms. The corresponding number of children without KD who would have received unnecessary IVIG treatment was not calculated. In any event, as long as the disadvantages of undertreating appear to outweigh the disadvantages of overtreating, some children who have a condition that mimics KD will receive unnecessary IVIG. Thus, continued consideration of alternative diagnoses in &quot;atypical cases&quot; is essential, particularly in children who fail to respond or respond only incompletely to IVIG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F115933\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115933 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6516194\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Earlier reports suggested a poor prognosis for infants and children with incomplete KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/5,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23,24</a>]. One review cited 41 percent mortality, although only children with coronary artery (CA) aneurysms were included in this series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, subsequent studies have indicated that outcomes in children with incomplete KD are comparable with those of children with complete disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Nonetheless, children with incomplete features of KD are more likely to be diagnosed later in the course of the illness, and prolonged fever is the strongest predictor of CA aneurysm formation. Thus, children will be best served if KD is at least considered in any case of unexplained fever lasting five or more days. In fact, the goal of the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines cited above is to remove precisely this obstacle to early diagnosis and treatment.
