They are most frequently associated with upper respiratory tract syndromes, such as pharyngitis or coryza, but can also cause pneumonia. Less commonly, adenoviruses cause gastrointestinal, ophthalmologic, genitourinary, and neurologic diseases. Most adenoviral diseases are self-limiting, although fatal infections can occur in immunocompromised hosts and occasionally in healthy children and adults.</p><p>In addition to their importance as infectious agents, adenoviruses are being studied intensively as vectors to deliver foreign genes both for gene therapy and for immunization against tumors and certain infections, such as HIV-1 and malaria. </p><p>The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infections will be reviewed here. Issues relating to pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-adenovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of adenovirus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VIRION STRUCTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenoviruses have a double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 35 kb surrounded by a nonenveloped icosahedron with fiber-like projections from each of the 12 vertices. The fiber protein is attached noncovalently to the icosahedron by a pentameric polypeptide named penton base. The fiber protein from most adenoviruses, except subgroup B, binds to the cellular receptor CAR (coxsackie-adenovirus receptor), which also binds coxsackie B virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Group B adenoviruses have been shown to bind to CD46, a complement-related protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The penton base mediates internalization via interaction with specific cellular integrins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The major surface protein of the virion is the trimeric polypeptide hexon. Group-reactive antigenic determinants are present on the hexon proteins from all human adenoviruses. Serotype-specific neutralizing epitopes are present both on the fiber and hexon proteins with minor sites on the penton base. In addition, many adenoviruses hemagglutinate rat or rhesus red blood cells; this property is related to the fiber protein.</p><p>Most adenoviruses readily infect human epithelial cell lines, exhibiting a characteristic cytopathic effect. This property is often used to isolate adenoviruses from clinical specimens in diagnostic virology laboratories.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3249428\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1319995730\"><span class=\"h2\">Serotype differences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain adenovirus serotypes are associated with distinct clinical manifestations, but the basis for these differences is not well understood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63104 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> below.)</p><p>Serotype-specific clinical manifestations may be partially determined by differences in cell tropism. Some serotypes, for example, display different cell receptor preferences, which are mediated by the viral attachment protein fiber. Although most adenoviruses from groups A, C, D, E, and F bind to the coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR), the group B adenoviruses do not bind to this receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Group B adenoviruses have been shown to bind to the complement-related protein CD46 as well as CD80 and CD86 (activation markers on hematopoietic cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/2,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5</a>]. After attachment, adenoviruses enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. This internalization process requires interaction of the viral protein penton base with alpha v integrins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, differences in the fiber and penton likely contribute to serotype-specific clinical manifestations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3678444323\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune response to adenoviruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenoviruses elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses. Recovery from adenovirus infection is associated with the development of serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies directed mainly at the major capsid protein hexon. Neutralizing antibodies protect against infection with the same serotype of the virus but not against other serotypes. The commercial assays for adenovirus antibodies, such as complement fixation (CF) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA), detect other adenovirus-specific antibodies that cross react with all serotypes. Nearly all adults have serologic evidence of past infection with one or more adenoviruses.</p><p>The most important host defense against many viruses, including adenoviruses, is cell-mediated immunity. Fatal adenovirus infections occur most commonly in immunocompromised patients, especially those with defects in cell-mediated immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Adenovirus-specific memory CD4+ T cells can be detected in most healthy adults and can exhibit cross-reactivity against different serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As an example, a specific CD4+ T cell epitope on the hexon is highly conserved among different serotypes and is recognized by 75 percent of healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Adenovirus-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are detected at lower frequencies, some of which also target conserved epitopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3570217918\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenovirus proteins modulate host responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of mechanisms to downregulate nonspecific and specific inflammatory responses have been demonstrated in adenoviruses. Several proteins expressed early in the adenovirus replicative cycle may modulate the host immune response. Adenoviruses express early regulatory proteins under the control of the early region 1A (E1A). E1A is a trans-activating region that controls expression from the other early regions E1B, E2, E3, and E4. Viral DNA replication takes place after expression of the early proteins, followed by synthesis of late structural viral proteins and inhibition of host protein synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Virions are then assembled in the nucleus and released when the cell dies. This process of virus release is facilitated by the E3 region 11.6K protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The E3 region, which is not essential for viral replication, encodes several proteins that modulate host functions in response to viral infection. The E3-19K transmembrane glycoprotein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and binds to newly synthesized MHC class I molecules. As a consequence, the intracellular transport and cell surface expression of class I molecules is dramatically inhibited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. E3-19K also binds TAP and may inhibit class I molecule maturation by delaying peptide loading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Downregulation of class I antigens, which are required for antigen presentation to CD8+ CTLs, may help adenovirus-infected cells evade recognition.</p><p>Furthermore, the E3 region protects cells from apoptosis-inducing cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Fas ligand, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). The E3 14.7K protein is a potent inhibitor of TNF-mediated apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The E3 10.4K and 14.5K complex, also known as RID (receptor internalization and degradation), down-regulates Fas, TNF, and TRAIL receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Fas-mediated apoptosis is a major pathway for CTL-mediated cell lysis. The E3 19K protein down-regulates class I MHC from surfaces of infected cells. As a consequence, adenovirus-infected cells are resistant to apoptosis and CTL killing. In fact, these E3 region proteins have been employed in murine models to prevent rejection of transplanted hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] or transplanted islet cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The fact that adenoviruses have developed diverse mechanisms to evade host responses suggests that these must be important modes of adaptation for the virus. One postulate is that these proteins play a role in reducing inflammation during acute infection. Another explanation is that these proteins may facilitate the establishment of persistent infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1611313319\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenoviruses are frequently shed in stool for weeks after acute infection in immunocompetent individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] and for months in immunocompromised patients. There are case reports of transmission of adenoviruses to recipients of infected solid organ transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Adenoviral disease may also be caused by reactivation of endogenous infection in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, analogous to reactivation of herpesviruses in these hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. However, the reservoirs and mechanisms for persistent adenovirus infections in humans are not well understood.</p><p>Adenoviruses can be detected in long-term cultures of tonsillar tissue. Adenoviruses have also been shown to persist in CD4+ T cells isolated from tonsils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Although adenoviruses infect lymphocytes and monocytes very inefficiently in vitro, one study demonstrated that a subset of B and T cell lines supported adenovirus replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There is also one report of a spontaneous persistent adenovirus infection of a cell line maintained in tissue culture that derived from an Epstein-Barr virus&ndash;positive B cell lymphoma from a hematopoietic cell transplant recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These data suggest that adenoviruses can persist in some human cell types without causing cell lysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenoviruses have a worldwide distribution, and infections occur throughout the year. Adenoviruses cause 5 to 10 percent of all febrile illnesses in infants and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Most individuals have serologic evidence of prior adenoviral infection by the age of 10.</p><p>Adenovirus infections are prevalent in daycare centers and in households with young children. Nosocomial transmission also has been documented.</p><p>Many epidemics of adenoviral disease have been described, including pharyngoconjunctival fever in summer camps and in association with public swimming pools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], keratoconjunctivitis in medical facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], and serious acute respiratory disease in military recruits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

Adenoviruses can survive for long periods on environmental surfaces; they are resistant to lipid disinfectants because they are nonenveloped, but they are inactivated by heat, formaldehyde, or bleach (sodium hypochlorite).</p><p>There are several other modes of adenovirus transmission:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonates can acquire adenoviral infection from exposure to cervical secretions at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].

Intrauterine infection has also been detected in fetal tissue by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic evidence that adenoviruses can be transmitted from donor kidney and liver transplants suggests that these organs occasionally harbor adenoviruses in a latent form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Serotype prevalence</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over 60 human adenovirus serotypes have been identified based upon antigenic determinants detected by viral neutralization assay. Serotypes are further classified into six subgroups, A to F, based upon differences in patterns of hemagglutination. Serotypes within each subgroup are closely related at the DNA level and frequently share similar biologic properties. As examples, subgroup B serotypes 11, 34, and 35 cause hemorrhagic cystitis, whereas subgroup D serotypes 8, 19, and 37 are associated with keratoconjunctivitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63104 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The prevalence of the different serotypes cannot be determined with confidence since the vast majority of patients with adenovirus infection are not tested. From 2003 to 2016 in the United States, the most commonly detected serotypes were serotypes 3, 2, 1, 7, and 14; these serotypes accounted for 1283 of 1497 reports (86 percent) in which the serotype was identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Since that time, both susceptibility and clinical infection due to adenovirus increased in military recruits. Rare fatalities were reported in recruits due to probable adenovirus pneumonia with or without accompanying encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 341 military recruits in 2004 found that more than three-quarters were susceptible to either adenovirus serotype 4 or serotype 7 infection and, during active surveillance, one-quarter developed a febrile respiratory illness attributable to adenovirus serotype 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Furthermore, the percentage of recruits seropositive for this strain increased from 34 percent at enrollment to 97 percent by the end of the study.

However, the distribution appears to be changing. In a series of 1867 military recruits with adenovirus respiratory infections, serotype 4 was the most prevalent serotype between 2002 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], while in 2006 subgroup B adenoviruses became more prevalent, including serotypes 3, 7, 21, and 14. The emergence of adenovirus 14 is discussed in detail below.

They are most frequently associated with upper respiratory tract syndromes, such as pharyngitis or coryza, but can also cause pneumonia. Less commonly, adenoviruses cause gastrointestinal, ophthalmologic, genitourinary, and neurologic diseases. Most adenoviral diseases are self-limiting, although fatal infections can occur in immunocompromised hosts and occasionally in healthy children and adults. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenoviruses have a double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 35 kb surrounded by a nonenveloped icosahedron with fiber-like projections. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Virion structure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenoviruses have a worldwide distribution, and infections occur throughout the year. Most individuals have serologic evidence of prior adenoviral infection by the age of 10. Adenovirus infections are prevalent in daycare centers and in households with young children. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many epidemics of adenoviral disease have been described, including pharyngoconjunctival fever in summer camps and in association with public swimming pools, keratoconjunctivitis in medical facilities, and serious acute respiratory disease in military recruits. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over 60 human adenovirus serotypes have been identified based upon antigenic determinants detected by viral neutralization assay. Serotypes are further classified into six subgroups, A to F. Serotypes within each subgroup frequently share similar biologic properties. As examples, subgroup B serotypes 11, 34, and 35 cause hemorrhagic cystitis, whereas subgroup D serotypes 8, 19, and 37 are associated with keratoconjunctivitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63104 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenovirus 14 is a subgroup B serotype that was first identified in military recruits in the Netherlands in 1955. It subsequently emerged in the United States in 2005 as a cause of outbreaks of severe respiratory illness in military recruits and civilians. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Adenovirus serotype 14'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of adenoviral disease vary according to the age and immunocompetence of the host (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75951 \">table 2</a>). Severe disease has been associated primarily with subgroups B and C serotypes. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A wide range of clinical syndromes has been reported in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, including pneumonia, colitis, hepatitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, encephalitis, and disseminated disease. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast with HCT recipients, adenoviral disease typically involves the donor organ in solid organ transplant recipients.
