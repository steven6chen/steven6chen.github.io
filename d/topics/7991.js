Most headaches are caused by one of four syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76857\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76857 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tension-type headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic daily headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cluster headache </p><p/><p>The causes and diagnosis of non-migraine headaches are discussed here. Migraine headaches are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-headaches-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Migraine headaches in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.) A summary of headache treatments is also available.

Unlike migraine, tension headaches occur without other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to lights and sounds, or an aura. However, some people have symptoms of both tension and migraine headache.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MIGRAINE HEADACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Migraine headaches are a type of headache that causes moderate to severe pain that is worsened by light, noise, and motion. Some people also experience nausea and vomiting. Migraine headaches typically last for a few hours, but may last for as long as three days. Migraines are discussed in detail in a separate article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-headaches-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Migraine headaches in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLUSTER HEADACHE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cluster headaches are severe, debilitating headaches that occur repeatedly for weeks to months at a time, followed by periods with no headache. Cluster headaches are relatively uncommon, affecting less than one percent of people. Men are affected more commonly than women, with a peak age of onset of 25 to 50 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cluster headaches:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Begin quickly without any warning and reach a peak within a few minutes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The headache is usually deep, excruciating, continuous, and explosive in quality, although occasionally it may be pulsatile and throbbing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The attack may occur up to eight times per day but is usually short in duration (between 15 minutes and three hours).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pain typically begins in or around the eye or temple; less commonly it starts in the face, neck, ear, or side of the head.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pain is always on one side.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most people with cluster headache are restless and may pace or rock back and forth when an attack is in progress.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cluster headaches are associated with eye redness and tear production on the side of the pain, a stuffy and runny nose, sweating, and pale skin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some people are light sensitive in the eye on the affected side.</p><p/><p>Cluster headaches can begin at any age. People with cluster headaches are more likely to have family members who also have cluster headaches. Drinking alcohol can bring on a cluster headache.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC DAILY HEADACHE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people develop very frequent headaches, as frequent as every day in some cases. When a headache is present for more than 15 days per month for at least three months, it is described as a chronic daily headache.</p><p>Chronic daily headache is not a type of headache but a category that includes frequent headaches of various kinds. Most people with chronic daily headache have migraine or tension-type headache as the underlying type of headache. They often start out having an occasional migraine or tension-type headache, but the headaches became more frequent over months or years. Some people with frequent headache use headache medications too often, which can lead to &quot;medication-overuse headaches&quot; (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Medication-overuse headache'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication-overuse headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medication-overuse headache (MOH) may occur in people who have frequent migraine, cluster, or tension-type headaches, which leads them to overuse pain medications. A vicious cycle occurs whereby frequent headaches cause the person to take medication frequently (often non-prescription medication), which then causes a rebound headache as the medication wears off, causing more medication use, and so on.</p><p>Overuse of any number of pain medications can increase the risk of developing medication-overuse headaches. To avoid medication-overuse headaches, we recommend the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If possible, avoid butalbital combinations (Fiorinal&reg;, Fioricet&reg;, Esgic&reg;) and narcotics completely.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not use triptans (Imitrex&reg; and others) or <span class=\"nowrap\">aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine</span> combinations (Excedrin&reg;) more than nine days per month.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not use NSAIDS (eg, ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, aspirin) more than 15 days per month.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not take acetaminophen (eg, Tylenol&reg;) more than two times per week.</p><p/><p>If you have frequent headaches, you may need a preventive medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Headache treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER TYPES OF HEADACHE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of other causes of headache.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Sinus headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent headaches related to sinus infections are uncommon. Many, if not most, people diagnosed with sinus headaches actually have migraine headaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-headaches-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Migraine headaches in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sinus-related pain usually lasts for several days (unlike a typical migraine) and does not cause nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to noise or light (as seen in migraine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-causes-and-diagnosis-in-adults-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic rhinosinusitis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-trauma headaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headaches that occur within one to two days after a head injury are relatively common. Most people report a generalized dull, aching, constant discomfort that worsens intermittently. Other common symptoms include vertigo (sensation of spinning), lightheadedness, difficulty concentrating, problems with memory, becoming tired quickly, and irritability.</p><p>Post-trauma headaches may continue for up to a few months, although anyone with a headache that does not begin to improve within a week or two after a traumatic event should be evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">HEADACHE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians typically use a person's description of their headache, in combination with an examination, to determine the type of headache. Some people have more than one type of headache.</p><p>Most people do not need x-rays or imaging tests. A CT scan (or MRI) may be recommended in some circumstances, for example, if symptoms are unusual, if there are any danger signs (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Headache danger signs'</a> below), or if there are any abnormalities seen during the examination. Other possible reasons for brain imaging include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches that steadily worsen despite treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sudden change in the pattern of headaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs or symptoms that suggest that another medical condition may be causing symptoms</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">HEADACHE DANGER SIGNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of headaches are not life threatening. You should seek medical attention immediately if your headache:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comes on suddenly, becomes severe within a few <strong>seconds</strong> or <strong>minutes</strong>, or that could be described as &quot;the worst headache of your life&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is severe and occurs with a fever or stiff neck</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occurs with a seizure, personality changes, confusion, or passing out</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Begins quickly after strenuous exercise or minor injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is new and occurs with weakness, numbness, or difficulty seeing. While migraine headaches can sometimes cause these symptoms, you should be evaluated urgently the first time these symptoms appear.</p><p/><p>If you have persistent or frequent headaches, headaches that interfere with normal activities, or your headaches become more painful, you should see a healthcare provider during normal office hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Headaches and brain tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headaches occur in approximately 50 percent of people who have brain tumors. However, headaches are very common and brain tumors are <strong>rarely</strong> found in people who are evaluated for headaches. Many people with brain tumors have chronic headaches that are worse with bending over or occur with nausea and vomiting, although these symptoms can also occur with headaches not related to a brain tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">HEADACHE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of headaches is discussed separately.
