Its discovery at the turn of the century was based upon its profound effect on meal-stimulated acid secretion, making it one of the first hormones to be described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The study of gastrin accelerated with the isolation and characterization of the peptide in 1964 after which it was found to promote growth of the gastric antrum and have a proliferative effect, which has implicated it as having a possible role in cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The cloning and characterization of the gastrin receptor in 1992 has provided a valuable tool in the study of gastrointestinal hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the physiology of gastrin.

The active hormone is generated from a precursor peptide &quot;preprogastrin&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52877\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52877 \">figure 1</a>). Human preprogastrin contains 101 amino acids (AA) including a signal peptide (21 AA), spacer sequence (37 AA), gastrin component (34 AA) and a 9 AA extension segment at the carboxyl terminus. The enzymatic processing of preprogastrin produces all of the known physiologically active forms of gastrin.</p><p>Preprogastrin is processed into progastrin and gastrin peptide fragments of various sizes by sequential enzymatic cleavage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52877\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52877 \">figure 1</a>). Like other hormones, gastrin is synthesized on rough endoplasmic reticulum, processed in the Golgi apparatus, and packaged in secretory granules, where final modifications occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In endocrine cells, the glycine residue at the carboxyl terminus is cleaved and the terminus is amidated to form the mature gastrin peptide.</p><p>Two major forms of gastrin are secreted (G-34 and G-17), although larger G-71 and smaller G-6 forms exist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51646 \">table 1</a>). The common feature of all gastrins is an amidated tetrapeptide (Try-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) at the carboxyl terminus that imparts full biological activity. Modification by sulfation at tyrosine residues produces alternative gastrin forms. The circulating half-life of gastrin is affected by the size of the various molecular forms. The full physiologic response is determined by the presence of the biologically active moiety and the time available for receptor interaction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-peptides-in-health-and-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal peptides in health and disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gastrin can be ectopically expressed in non-endocrine cells, such as tumors. However, because these cells lack secretory vesicles, prohormone convertases and amidating enzymes, the main forms of gastrin secreted are progastrins including glycine-extended gastrin. These forms of gastrin may have growth promoting effects on certain tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TISSUE DISTRIBUTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of gastrin is produced in endocrine cells of the gastric antrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Much smaller amounts of gastrin are produced in other regions of the gastrointestinal tract including the nonantral stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and pancreas. Gastrin has also been found outside of the gastrointestinal tract including the brain, adrenal glands, respiratory tract, and reproductive organs, although its biological role in these sites is unknown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58007\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58007 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RECEPTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cDNA and the gene for the gastrin receptor have been cloned and sequenced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is now clear that the receptors for gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) are related and, therefore, constitute the <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;CCK/Gastrin</span> receptor family.&quot; The CCK-A (alimentary) and CCK-B (brain) receptor cDNAs were cloned from pancreas and brain, respectively, after which it was recognized that the CCK-B receptor was identical to the gastrin receptor of the gastric antrum. The CCK-A and -B receptors have been renamed CCK1 and CCK2 receptors, respectively. The CCK2 receptor is present on parietal cells but is more abundantly expressed in enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells of the stomach, and the major effects of gastrin on acid secretion are through its action on the CCK2 receptor on ECL cells.</p><p>The CCK1 receptor is abundant in the pancreas and gallbladder and has a 1000-fold higher affinity for cholecystokinin than for gastrin. In addition to its presence in the stomach, the <span class=\"nowrap\">CCK2/gastrin</span> receptor is abundant in brain tissue and is also found on pancreatic islet cells. The CCK1 and the <span class=\"nowrap\">CCK2/gastrin</span> receptors have over 50 percent sequence homology and respond differentially to various receptor antagonists, and to gastrin.</p><p>Both receptors are classical G protein-coupled receptors containing seven membrane-spanning domains and signal via pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63760 \">figure 2</a>). Agonist stimulation <span class=\"nowrap\">CCK/gastrin</span> receptor activates a specific G protein, stimulating the production of second messengers that include inositol phosphate, calcium, and activating protein kinase C. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptide-hormone-signal-transduction-and-regulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptide hormone signal transduction and regulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A CCK2 receptor variant (also referred to as the CCK-C receptor) possessing an extra 69 amino acids in the third intracellular loop has been found in colorectal tumors and Barrett's metaplasia of the esophagus, but not normal adjacent tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], and in some pancreatic cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This receptor has slightly higher affinity for glycine-extended gastrin and increased constitutive activity that may have a role in cancer growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">GASTRIN PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrin is released from specialized endocrine cells (G cells) into the circulation in response to a meal. The specific components of a meal that stimulate gastrin release include protein, peptides, and amino acids. Gastrin release is profoundly influenced by the pH of the stomach; fasting and increased gastric acid in the stomach inhibit its release, whereas a high gastric pH provides a strong stimulus for its secretion. The G cells are tightly regulated by two counterbalancing hormones, gastrin-releasing peptide and somatostatin, which exert stimulatory and inhibitory effects, respectively.</p><p>As mentioned above, gastrin is a primary physiologic mediator of gastric acid secretion. The human stomach secretes approximately 2 to 3 liters of acid-rich fluid per day. The regulation of acid secretion is influenced by the central, peripheral, and enteric nervous systems and multiple chemical messengers including gastrin, histamine, somatostatin, and acetylcholine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gastric acid secretion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Physiological regulation of gastrin secretion is highest when nutrients are in direct contact with G cells. Consequently, diversion of food from the antrum of the stomach, as with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, has been associated with low blood levels of gastrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>The major cellular determinants of acid secretion involve the antral gastrin-secreting G cell, the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell of the stomach that secretes histamine, and the somatostatin-secreting D cell. The acid-secreting parietal cell possesses receptors for acetylcholine, histamine, and gastrin. Although activation of all three of these receptors can stimulate acid secretion, the most important mechanism of acid release occurs via stimulation of the ECL cell to secrete histamine, which in turn stimulates the parietal cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The ECL cell receives stimulatory signals from gastrin and inhibitory signals from somatostatin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65068 \">figure 3</a>). Somatostatin also provides inhibitory signals to antral G cells.</p><p>As noted above, the CCK2 receptor can be found on pancreatic islet cells, and hypergastrinemia has been associated with islet cell hyperplasia and enhanced insulin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In animals, coadministration of gastrin and glucagon-like peptide-1 can restore normoglycemia in diabetic mice, suggesting that gastrin may have incretin-like effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glucagon-like peptide-1'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Transgenic and gene deletion animal models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of gastrin in mammalian physiology has been studied with the use of mouse models that are deficient in the expression of gastrin or the gastrin receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Gastrin-deficient mice have reduced numbers of parietal cells and are hypochlorhydric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Interestingly, administration of gastrin and glycine-extended gastrin in combination maintains parietal cell function more effectively than either peptide alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Gastric acid production cannot be induced by histamine or cholinergic agents, suggesting a significant defect in parietal cell function. Mice in which the gastrin receptor has been knocked out are hypochlorhydric, have reduced parietal cell mass, and decreased numbers of ECL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Hypochlorhydria is often accompanied by intestinal metaplasia in the stomach and bacterial overgrowth, which have been associated with the eventual appearance of gastric tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>These animal models have also provided insight into the role of gastrin in extragastric locations. Mice lacking the gastrin gene demonstrate decreased proliferation of the colonic mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes of hypergastrinemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypergastrinemia is observed in a number of settings, of which use of acid-suppressive medications and chronic atrophic gastritis are by far the most common. The mechanism of hypergastrinemia in these conditions is related to the stimulation of gastrin production by the alkaline pH environment, explaining the increased plasma gastrin levels often associated with Helicobacter pylori infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Another important, but far less common, association is the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is caused by a gastrin-producing tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78549\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78549 \">picture 1</a>). Most patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have serum gastrin concentrations between 150 and 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (71 and 475 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span>. This degree of gastrin elevation can also be observed in a variety of other settings, which need to be considered when evaluating a patient found to have hypergastrinemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60819 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The highest gastrin levels (&gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> although rare, are seen with gastrin-secreting tumors or chronic atrophic gastritis accompanying pernicious anemia. Modest elevations in serum gastrin (approximately 200 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> are much more common and are often due to acid-suppressive medications (ie, H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors) or H. pylori-associated gastritis.</p><p>Other rare causes of achlorhydria-associated hypergastrinemia may occur in the absence of gastritis. For example, impaired potassium secretion into the gastric lumen can reduce hydrogen-potassium proton pump activity on the apical surface of parietal cells, resulting in low acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patients with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome caused by mutations in the potassium channel gene <em>KCNQ1</em> gene not only have cardiac arrhythmias due to QT prolongation but have gastric achlorhydria, iron deficiency anemia, and hypergastrinemia as a consequence of impaired potassium ion secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF HYPERGASTRINEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical significance of chronic elevation in serum gastrin levels (as may be seen in patients taking proton pump inhibitors long-term) is uncertain. Gastrin receptors have been detected on a variety of tumor cells, and gastrin has trophic effects on the stomach and intestine, suggesting that it may have a role in the development of gastrointestinal malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The degree to which this might contribute to oncogenesis has not been defined. The concern related to hypergastrinemia has focused primarily on two issues: gastric carcinoid tumors, and cancer (particularly colon and pancreatic cancer).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric carcinoid tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypergastrinemia typically causes enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A major concern was the observation that prolonged hypergastrinemia from potent antisecretory therapy was associated with the development of ECL cell carcinoid tumors in rodents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These data led the Food and Drug Administration to initially restrict the indications for proton-pump inhibitors to short-term use. However, even though ECL hyperplasia may occur with long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, gastric carcinoid tumors are not as common in humans exposed to acid suppression for prolonged periods of time. ECL hyperplasia and carcinoids disappear when PPI therapy is stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As a result, these drugs are now commonly used for chronic treatment of a variety of acid-related disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders#H59974965\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proton pump inhibitors: Overview of use and adverse effects in the treatment of acid related disorders&quot;, section on 'Hypergastrinemia'</a>.)</p><p>Hypergastrinemia and carcinoid tumors occur in two clinical conditions: gastrinoma and pernicious anemia. Carcinoid tumors have been reported in up to 30 percent of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) and 5 percent of patients with atrophic gastritis and pernicious anemia. Interestingly, carcinoid tumors occur in only approximately 1 percent of patients with sporadic gastrinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. These findings suggest that carcinoid tumor formation requires not only hypergastrinemia but another cofactor, such as loss of the tumor suppressor gene, menin (the genetic defect in MEN-1), or overexpression of a tumor growth promoter such as BCL-2, which occurs in the setting of chronic inflammation and atrophic gastritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, the role of gastrin is central in the development of ECL carcinoids associated with atrophic gastritis since the gastrin receptor antagonist netazepide has been shown to induce regression of these carcinoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Colon cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrin has been implicated in colon cancer based upon laboratory and epidemiologic evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>].

A potential role was supported by a case-control study in which serum gastrin levels from 250 incident cases of colorectal cancer were compared with levels from controls without colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. After adjusting for some relevant covariates, an elevated serum gastrin concentration was found to be a significant risk factor for colorectal cancer (odds ratio 3.9). These findings support the concept that chronic hypergastrinemia by itself is not carcinogenic, but its proliferative effects may expand the pool of cells that could be at risk for carcinogenesis in susceptible patients. One group of patients at risk may be those infected with H. pylori [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. An increased rate of colon cancer has not been observed in patients with gastrinoma, pernicious anemia, or in those taking acid-suppressive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">CCK2/gastrin</span> receptors have been identified on human pancreatic cancer cells, where they can potentiate cancer growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Tissue distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The receptors for gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) are related and constitute the <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;CCK/Gastrin</span> receptor family.&quot; The CCK1 receptor is abundant in the pancreas and gallbladder and has a 1000-fold higher affinity for cholecystokinin than for gastrin. The <span class=\"nowrap\">CCK2/gastrin</span> receptor is found on parietal cells, on enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the stomach, in the brain, and on pancreatic islet cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrin is released from G cells into the circulation in response to a meal or to a high gastric pH. The G cells are tightly regulated by two counterbalancing hormones, gastrin-releasing peptide and somatostatin, which exert stimulatory and inhibitory effects, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Gastrin physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrin is a primary physiologic mediator of gastric acid secretion. Gastrin stimulates ECL cells, which then secrete histamine, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secret acid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65068 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Gastrin physiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical significance of chronic elevation in serum gastrin levels (as may be seen in patients taking proton pump inhibitors long-term) is uncertain. Gastrin receptors have been detected on a variety of tumor cells, and gastrin has trophic effects on the stomach and intestine, suggesting that it may have a role in the development of gastrointestinal malignancies. However, gastric carcinoid tumors have not developed in humans exposed to acid suppression for prolonged periods of time. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical significance of hypergastrinemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypergastrinemia is associated with the development of gastric carcinoid tumors. It has also been implicated in the development of colon and pancreatic cancer. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Gastric carcinoid tumors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Colon cancer'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-gastrin/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Edkins JS.
