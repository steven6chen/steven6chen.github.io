LTCFs include nursing homes, skilled-nursing facilities providing postacute care, assisted living facilities, retirement homes, rehabilitation centers, long-term care hospitals, long-term psychiatric facilities, and institutions for individuals with intellectual disabilities. For many residents, these facilities are a home as well as a place of nursing, medical, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychosocial care.</p><p>LTCFs provide a unique environment for transmission of infection between residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Types of infections and important pathogens in LTCFs will be reviewed here. Issues related to infection control in LTCFs are discussed separately.

Together, these infections represent 94 percent of infections seen in LTCFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/2,3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory tract infection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100921704\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mortality due to pneumonia is higher among residents of LTCFs than adults in the community. In addition, an episode of pneumonia in a LTCF resident is associated with increased mortality that persists for up to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Predisposing factors include underlying obstructive pulmonary disease, left heart failure, and risk of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Aspiration pneumonia is common in the presence of risk factors including stroke, neuromuscular disorders, or impaired consciousness.</p><p>Pneumonia in LTCFs may be caused by pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. The microbiology depends on whether residents have recently been in an acute care facility and their length of stay in the LTCF. <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is the most common pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Atypical pathogens such as <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> are less common in LTCFs than the general community.</p><p>Gram-negative bacilli are also an important cause of pneumonia in LTCFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/11,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-15</a>].</p><p>LTCF residents may be colonized with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. One study noted a colonization rate of 51 percent; the isolates included <em>Providencia stuartii</em>, <em>Morganella morganii</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, and <em>Enterobacter </em>spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Risk factors for colonization included dementia and nonambulatory status. Risk factors for pneumonia due to drug-resistant pathogens include antibiotic exposure in the past six months and low Activities of Daily Living score.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H251276387\"><span class=\"h3\">Influenza</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seasonal outbreaks of influenza affecting LTCF residents and staff are common and are associated with substantial morbidity. Outbreaks of seasonal influenza in LTCFs are well recognized, as are the challenges of preventing and controlling influenza outbreaks in these settings. Older adults may have less typical presentations of influenza, and this limits the opportunities for early recognition and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Case attack rates may be up to 70 percent, and case fatality rates may be more than 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of seasonal influenza in adults&quot;, section on 'Uncomplicated influenza'</a>.)</p><p>Annual influenza vaccination for LTCF residents and staff and residents is important for minimizing risk of infection; all residents and staff should be vaccinated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Mortality among LTCF residents has shown to be reduced by immunization of healthcare workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>The development of guidelines on the prevention and control of influenza in LTCFs is difficult due to the variation in the facility size, patient characteristics, and resources available. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a best-practice document to support managers of LTCFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/index.htm&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnseRKzFY6CHUs8WItD3AWslBLTpEvI3CcP66BwjvWJEZnL/NI0bBdDjRkMKUlmh2/7A==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3809\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">recommendations</a> for prevention and control of influenza.

The goal of testing for LTBI is to identify individuals who are at increased risk for the development of tuberculosis (TB) and therefore would benefit from treatment of LTBI. Testing for LTBI is warranted to identify individuals who are at risk of new infection and to identify individuals at increased risk of reactivation due to associated conditions. The indications and approach for LTBI testing are discussed separately; no modifications to this approach are needed for patients in LTCFs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies published in the 1980s suggested a high rate of TB transmission, new infection, and TB disease among older adults in nursing homes. In one study, disease was observed among 5.9 percent of individuals with skin test conversion in the absence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, cohort studies noted lower rates of disease among those who received isoniazid for treatment of LTBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Subsequent studies have not shown comparable rates of infection or disease among LTCF residents, and the benefits of isoniazid appear more modest (with perhaps greater harm) than initially suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/26-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H622262004\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary tract infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urinary tract is the most common site of infection among LTCF residents and the most common source of bacteremia; in addition, urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common reason for administration of antibiotics in LTCFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In one report, the incident rate of UTI among LTCF residents was 9.1 per 100 resident-days (among residents with indwelling catheters) and 2.8 per 1000 resident-days (among residents without indwelling catheters) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for UTI include urinary catheters, benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostatitis in men, atrophic vaginitis and estrogen deficiency in women, diabetes, neurogenic bladder, dementia, dehydration, and functional impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Important steps for prevention of catheter-associated UTI include avoidance of unnecessary catheterization, use of sterile technique for catheter placement, and removal of the catheter as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no role for screening asymptomatic patients for bacteriuria, as no treatment is indicated in such patients.

Among nursing home residents treated with antibiotics in the United States, 8 to 33 percent acquire <em>C. difficile</em> infection, and 10 to 30 percent of LTCF residents are colonized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Risk factors for infection include age, previous antibiotic use, recent hospitalization, and acid suppression. Adequate cleaning of LTCF environments, including removal of spores, is particularly difficult. There is no role for treatment of <em>C. difficile</em> infection in the setting of asymptomatic carriage. Issues related to prevention of <em>C. difficile</em> infection, including environmental cleaning and hand hygiene, are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-prevention-and-control\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection: Prevention and control&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Norovirus is highly contagious and can be transmitted person to person or via food and water. Other causes of foodborne outbreaks include <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Staphylococcus,</em> and <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities#H331295198\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of infection control in long-term care facilities&quot;, section on 'Bundled interventions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26315036\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes of infection in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) include respiratory infection, diarrheal disease, urinary tract infection, and skin and soft tissue infections. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for pneumonia include chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, and aspiration. Pathogens include organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia. (See <a href=\"#H100921704\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seasonal outbreaks of influenza are common and affect residents as well as staff. (See <a href=\"#H251276387\" class=\"local\">'Influenza'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrheal illness may be caused by viral or bacterial pathogens. <em>Clostridium difficile</em> is the most common cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea in resource-rich countries. Norovirus is highly contagious and can be transmitted person to person or via food and water. Other causes of foodborne outbreaks include <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Staphylococcus,</em> and <em>Escherichia coli</em> O157:H7. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diarrheal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The urinary tract is the most common site of infection among LTCF residents and the most common source of bacteremia. Urinary tract infections in LTCFs are often associated with urethral catheterization. There is no role for screening asymptomatic patients for bacteriuria. (See <a href=\"#H622262004\" class=\"local\">'Urinary tract infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial-resistant organisms are increasingly recognized in LTCFs. Organisms may be transferred between acute and long-term care facilities via LTCF residents, and transmission can occur via contact with colonized skin or fecal-oral transmission. (See <a href=\"#H100922517\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial-resistant organisms'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-infection-in-long-term-care-facilities-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">High KP, Bradley SF, Gravenstein S, et al.
