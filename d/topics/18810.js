Although observational data had suggested a survival benefit of bag-mask ventilation over advanced airway approaches, a recent randomized trial found no difference in the primary outcome (survival with favorable neurologic outcome at 28 days) with bag-mask ventilation versus endotracheal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-emergency-medicine/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, trial design issues raise questions about the validity and generalizability of these results. Bag-mask ventilation remains our preferred pre-hospital approach to airway management for cardiac arrest patients.

One randomized trial in over 15,000 critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-emergency-medicine/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and another in over 13,000 noncritically ill patients in the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-emergency-medicine/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] found that, compared with isotonic saline, balanced crystalloids reduced the composite outcome of death from any cause at 30 days, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction. Patients who received larger volumes (eg, &gt;2 liters) benefited the most. Because the median volumes of fluid administered in these trials were low (1 liter) and the absolute improvement in the composite response was modest (1 percentage point difference), we suggest choosing the solution based on patient-specific factors such as chemistries, estimated volume of resuscitation, and potential adverse effect of the infused solution.

Although most experts do <strong>not</strong> routinely use scoring systems to diagnose AMS in practice, clinical studies often use them. In a systematic review of 91 studies (almost 67,000 patients), the accuracy of instruments to diagnose AMS (eg, Acute Mountain Sickness-Cerebral score, Visual Analog Scale for the Overall Feeling of Mountain Sickness, or the Clinical Functional Score [CFS]) was assessed using the Lake Louise Questionnaire Score (LLQS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74655 \">table 1</a>) as the standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-emergency-medicine/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. All evaluated scores had similar diagnostic accuracy when compared with a LLQS &gt;5. In particular, the CFS was easy to administer relative to the other scores and may be a reasonable screening tool to identify potential patients with AMS in high altitude clinics or in research studies.

In a recent randomized trial, the use of PERC prior to conventional assessment (which included measuring a D-dimer level to determine further testing) did not alter the diagnostic rate of PE compared with conventional assessment alone. However, the PERC-based strategy did result in a 10 percent reduction in the use of computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. We continue to suggest using PERC when evaluating patients in whom there is a low suspicion for PE.

In a retrospective cohort study of patients treated over a four-year period at a specialty referral facility offering hyperbaric oxygen treatment, 61 patients treated for carbon monoxide poisoning had a history of exposure to waterpipe smoking. The most common symptoms were syncope, dizziness, headache, and nausea.

The prospective multicenter Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS) Plus D-Dimer in Suspected Acute Aortic Dissection (ADvISED) study used a combination of the ADD-RS and D-dimer as a diagnostic tool in over 1800 such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-emergency-medicine/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The combination of ADD-RS &le;1<strong> </strong>plus a negative D-dimer effectively ruled out AAS, missing only one case in about 300 patients, and would enable about 60 percent of patients with a low probability for AAS to be spared from unnecessary conclusive vascular imaging. Although this initial experience appears promising, additional validation in a broader patient population is needed before routine use of this combination as a diagnostic tool can be recommended.

Added to the risk related to chemical constituents produced during use of an ENDS, there is a risk of burns due to device malfunction. Burns to local tissue have occurred while an ENDS device was stored (eg, in a pants pocket) or during its use, resulting in burns to the thigh, groin, face, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-emergency-medicine/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In this context, questions arise about the risks of proceeding to surgery with uncorrected underlying abnormalities versus the risks of delaying surgery to perform a thorough preoperative assessment and optimize preoperative status. In a retrospective cohort study of over 40,000 patients, patients who had surgery for hip fracture within 24 hours of admission had lower 30-day mortality than patients who had surgery more than 24 hours after admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-emergency-medicine/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The results of this study support UpToDate's recommendation to perform surgery within 24 hours in patients who are medically stable. Patients with active medical comorbidities may require evaluation and stabilization of these issues before proceeding to surgery, but this should be done as quickly as possible.

A safety warning from the US Food and Drug Administration has been issued. There is insufficient information to guide the formulation of firm recommendations regarding this clinical scenario; our approach is presented. Clinicians should be aware of this issue and query patients about biotin or vitamin intake. When troponin results are unexpected, it is reasonable to further observe the patient and repeat the troponin test.

In a validation cohort of almost 1500 children undergoing evaluation for abdominal pain at one pediatric emergency department, the pARC predicted the risk for appendicitis with high discrimination and outperformed the Pediatric Appendicitis Score. However, additional validation of the calculator in multiple settings is needed prior to widespread use. Furthermore, use of the pARC requires sophisticated calculations that must be programmed and integrated into an electronic health record, which may be a barrier to its implementation in some settings.

These were intentional exposures, apparently in response to a challenge on social media. Ingestion of concentrated forms of laundry or dishwasher detergent, especially single-use packets, may cause caustic esophageal injury, as well as respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and occasionally coma and death.

Human rhinovirus was most commonly detected. This study supports limiting diagnostic testing for bacterial illness in well-appearing febrile infants 29 to 90 days of age when highly accurate rapid viral testing is positive. However, a full sepsis evaluation is still indicated in neonates, regardless of the results of respiratory virus testing. Highly accurate testing for bronchiolitis and influenza is widely available, while panels for other viral pathogens (eg, human rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> human metapneumovirus) are not always readily available and may be cost-prohibitive.

In prior studies comparing VL with direct laryngoscopy (DL) for intubation of non-critically ill children by experienced providers, intubation times were longer for VL and adverse events and successful first pass rates were not improved. A new observational report, based on data from an international registry of airway management in pediatric intensive care units, compares outcomes for over 900 endotracheal intubations using VL with 8875 intubations performed by DL, although children were not randomized to undergo VL or DL and thus likely to have had differing prognostic characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-emergency-medicine/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. VL was associated with fewer tracheal intubation adverse events (eg, mainstem bronchial intubation, recognized esophageal intubation, or vomiting without aspiration) but not fewer severe events (eg, cardiac arrest, laryngospasm, esophageal intubation with delayed recognition, or aspiration) or need for multiple (&ge;3) attempts.

ELM may improve the glottic view during laryngoscopy in selected patients (eg, children with anteriorly placed airways due to congenital anomalies or trauma patients with cervical spinal motion restriction in place), but routine use for endotracheal intubation in children does not appear to be beneficial.

To date, studies of introducers have been performed almost exclusively in the operating room. However, in a recent observational study of over 500 consecutive intubations performed in a single, urban academic emergency department, use of an ETI was independently associated with greater first-pass success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-emergency-medicine/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Clinicians responsible for emergency airway management should be familiar with this useful, inexpensive tool.

The benefit of HBO was most pronounced for patients with acute respiratory failure and patients younger than 20 years of age. Despite the limitations associated with observational studies, this study provides support for HBO therapy in patients with altered mental status or other severe manifestations of carbon monoxide poisoning such as severe metabolic acidosis or end-organ ischemia.
