Its annual incidence is six per million people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mean age at diagnosis is 40 to 45 years.</p><p>The causes and clinical features of acromegaly will be reviewed here. The laboratory diagnosis and treatment of acromegaly are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of acromegaly&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acromegaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of acromegaly is a somatotroph (growth hormone [GH]-secreting) adenoma of the anterior pituitary. These adenomas account for about one-third of all hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73104 \">table 1</a>). GH excess that occurs before fusion of the epiphyseal growth plates in a child or adolescent is called pituitary gigantism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pituitary-gigantism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pituitary gigantism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An activating mutation of the alpha subunit of the guanine nucleotide stimulatory protein (Gs-alpha) gene is found in approximately 40 percent of somatotroph adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. These mutations result in constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase, which may play a role in both cell division in and excessive GH secretion by these adenomas.</p><p>The pituitary tumor transforming gene is also overexpressed in most human somatotroph adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It also appears to play a role in tumor invasiveness, since expression is increased in tumors that invade the sphenoid bone.</p><p>Microduplications on chromosome Xq26.3 have been associated with excessive GH in children with gigantism and in adults with acromegaly. In a study of 43 patients with gigantism due to GH excess, microduplications in the Xp26.3 region that includes the <em>GPR101</em> (G protein-coupled receptor 101) gene were identified in 13 patients (termed X-linked acrogigantism [X-LAG]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. All patients identified with this microduplication had disease onset before five years of age, and the G protein-coupled receptor was overexpressed in the patients' pituitary lesions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pituitary-gigantism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pituitary gigantism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-chromosome-abnormalities#H503523631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sex chromosome abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Xp26.3 microduplication'</a>). In the same study, a recurrent mutation in <em>GPR101</em> was found in 11 of 248 adult patients with acromegaly (mostly in pituitary tumors). Other known causes of acromegaly, all very rare, are excess secretion of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) by hypothalamic tumors, ectopic GHRH secretion by neuroendocrine tumors such as carcinoid tumors or small-cell lung cancers, and ectopic secretion of GH by neuroendocrine tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10530955\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of acromegaly are attributable to high serum concentrations of both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is GH-dependent. Excess GH and IGF-1 have both somatic and metabolic effects. The somatic effects include stimulation of growth of many tissues, such as skin, connective tissue, cartilage, bone, viscera, and many epithelial tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The metabolic effects include nitrogen retention, insulin antagonism, and lipolysis.</p><p/><p>In addition, the somatotroph adenoma itself may cause symptoms due to its size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Insidious onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of acromegaly is insidious, and its progression is usually very slow. The average interval from the onset of symptoms until diagnosis is about 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but determining the onset, which is usually done from old photographs, is very difficult. At diagnosis, about 75 percent of patients have macroadenomas (tumor diameter 10 mm or greater), and some of the adenomas extend to the parasellar or suprasellar regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Overall, approximately 60 percent of patients eventually have headaches and 10 percent have visual symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/1,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct effects of tumor</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Headache/vision loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with acromegaly and large tumors have symptoms due to direct compressive effects of the tumor mass, such as headache, visual field defects (classically bitemporal hemianopsia), and cranial nerve palsies. In a series of 310 patients with acromegaly, headache and visual defects were reported as the presenting features in 8 and 3 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, approximately 60 percent of patients eventually develop headaches and 10 percent develop visual symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. Headache, however, may be the direct result of the elevated serum GH concentration, as well as of the mass effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Pituitary function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A somatotroph macroadenoma, due to its size, can cause decreased secretion of other pituitary hormones, most commonly gonadotropins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Many women with acromegaly have menstrual dysfunction, with or without galactorrhea, and some have hot flashes and vaginal atrophy as a result of estrogen deficiency. In a study of 47 women of reproductive age who had acromegaly, 29 (62 percent) had amenorrhea and seven (15 percent) had oligomenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Men may have erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, decreased facial hair growth and a decrease in testicular volume.</p><p>Hyperprolactinemia occurs in about 30 percent of patients. In some patients it is due to cosecretion of prolactin and GH by a somatomammotroph adenoma, in which case the serum prolactin concentration may be over 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. In other patients, the cause is likely interference with hypothalamic-pituitary blood flow, in which case the serum prolactin concentration will likely be less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>.</p><p>In a pilot study from a multicenter acromegaly registry (363 patients), hypogonadism was present in 53 percent of patients (49 percent of men and 57 percent of women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Prevalence of hypogonadism was similar in those with macroadenomas and microadenomas (54 and 38 percent, respectively). In macroadenoma patients, hypogonadism was more common in those with coexisting hyperprolactinemia. The cause of the hypogonadism in patients with microadenomas and normal serum prolactin concentrations is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of secondary hypogonadism in males&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and corticotropin (ACTH) deficiency occur less commonly than other pituitary hormonal deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of GH/IGF-1 excess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term growth hormone (GH) excess results in overgrowth of many tissues, including connective tissue, cartilage, bone, skin, and visceral organs. Other systemic complications include cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, metabolic disorders, and colon neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Soft tissue and skin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virtually all patients with acromegaly have acral and soft tissue overgrowth and skin thickening. The characteristic findings are an enlarged jaw (macrognathia) and enlarged, swollen hands and feet, which result in increasing shoe and glove size and the need to enlarge rings.</p><p>The facial features become coarse, with enlargement of the nose and frontal bones as well as the jaw, and the teeth become spread apart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68059%7EENDO%2F64652\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68059 graphicRef64652 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Despite the prominence of these findings at the time of diagnosis, the rate of change is so slow that few patients seek care because their appearance had changed or for other symptoms related to acral enlargement (eg, only 13 percent of 256 patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]).</p><p>Manifestations of soft tissue overgrowth include macroglossia, deepening of the voice, and paresthesias of the hands (eg, carpal tunnel syndrome in around 20 percent). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that the pathology of median neuropathy in acromegaly is increased edema of the median nerve, which resolves rapidly with reduction of serum GH and IGF-1 concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Other patients have a symmetric sensorimotor peripheral (rarely hypertrophic) neuropathy unrelated to entrapment.</p><p>Macroglossia and enlargement of the soft tissues of the pharynx and larynx lead to obstructive sleep apnea in about 50 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Sleep apnea'</a> below.)</p><p>The skin thickens, making it hard to puncture, and skin tags may appear. Hyperhidrosis is common (present in around 50 percent of patients), often making the patient malodorous. Hair growth increases and some women have hirsutism (56 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone and joints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When excess GH secretion occurs in children, eg, before the epiphyses of the long bones are fused, linear growth does increase; the result is pituitary giantism. In contrast, adults with acromegaly do <strong>not</strong> become taller. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pituitary-gigantism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pituitary gigantism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Synovial tissue and cartilage enlarge, causing hypertrophic arthropathy of the knees, ankles, hips, spine, and other joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Joint symptoms are a common presenting feature of the disease, and back pain (and kyphosis) is common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64058%7ERHEUM%2F82074\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64058 graphicRef82074 \">image 1A-B</a>). Back pain may also be due to osteoporosis caused by concurrent gonadal insufficiency due to the enlarging pituitary tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatic-and-bone-disorders-associated-with-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rheumatic and bone disorders associated with acromegaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bone density may be increased in both the spine and hip in acromegaly, at least in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], but not if the women are estrogen deficient. A meta-analysis of 41 studies reported a high prevalence of vertebral fractures in patients with active acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

In one study of 37 patients with acromegaly, 34 (92 percent) had an enlarged thyroid gland when assessed by ultrasonography; the mean thyroid size was more than five times normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another report, 39 of 45 patients (87 percent) had palpable diffuse or multinodular goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In one systematic review, 4 percent or patients with acromegaly also had thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], higher than rates in the general population. It is unclear whether this association is due to increased <span class=\"nowrap\">GH/IGF-1</span> levels or enhanced ascertainment by the treating endocrinologists. Thyroid function is usually normal, but some patients with goiter have subclinical hyperthyroidism. A few patients have central hypothyroidism caused by their pituitary tumor. Thyroid function is usually normal in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular abnormalities include hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and cardiomyopathy.</p><p>The cardiomyopathy is characterized by diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The abnormalities are due both to hypertension (present in 43 percent of patients with active disease in one report) and to the acromegaly itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

A high plasma fibrinogen concentration occurs in acromegaly and is reduced when serum GH concentrations are lowered with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Heart failure occurs in 3 to 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Compared to patients with acromegaly without heart failure, these patients had an increase in left ventricular mass index that was largely due to chamber dilation, a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (42 versus 66 percent), and a significant elevation in cardiac index (4.3 versus 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> per m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>An increased prevalence of valvular heart disease has also been reported. In a series of 40 patients with acromegaly, echocardiography demonstrated significant aortic regurgitation in 30 percent and mitral regurgitation in 5 percent; the comparable values in a control group matched for age, sex, hypertension and left ventricular systolic function were 7 and 0 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

In most cases, craniofacial deformities, macroglossia, and enlargement of the soft tissues of the pharynx and larynx result in obstructive sleep apnea.

This recommendation is consistent with the 2009 guidelines from the Acromegaly Consensus Group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H638590802\"><span class=\"h4\">Diverticula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acromegaly also appears to be associated with an increased prevalence of colonic diverticula, as illustrated by a case-control study comparing 107 patients with cured or biochemically controlled acromegaly and 214 age- and sex-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Diverticula were present on colonoscopy in 39 and 19 percent of patients with acromegaly and controls, respectively.

Its annual incidence is three to six per million people. The mean age at diagnosis is 40 to 45 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common cause of acromegaly is a somatotroph (GH-secreting) adenoma of the anterior pituitary. These adenomas account for about one-third of all hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas. An activating mutation of the alpha subunit of the guanine nucleotide stimulatory protein (Gs-alpha) gene is found in approximately 40 percent of somatotroph adenomas. These mutations result in constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase, which may play a role in both cell division and excessive GH secretion by these adenomas. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of acromegaly are attributable to high serum concentrations of both pituitary-derived GH and liver-derived insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is GH-dependent. Excess GH and IGF-1 have both somatic and metabolic effects. In addition, the somatotroph adenoma itself may cause local symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H10530955\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of acromegaly is insidious, and its progression is usually very slow. The interval from the onset of symptoms until diagnosis is about 12 years. At diagnosis, about 75 percent of patients have macroadenomas (tumor diameter 10 mm or greater) and some of the adenomas extend to the parasellar or suprasellar regions. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Insidious onset'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with acromegaly and large tumors have symptoms due to compressive effects of the tumor, such as headache, visual field defects (classically bitemporal hemianopsia), and cranial nerve palsies. Overall, approximately 60 percent of patients eventually have headaches and 10 percent have visual symptoms. Macroadenomas can also cause decreased secretion of other pituitary hormones, most commonly gonadotropins. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Direct effects of tumor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virtually all patients with acromegaly have acral and soft tissue overgrowth, and skin thickening. The characteristic findings are an enlarged jaw (macrognathia) and enlarged, swollen hands and feet, which result in increasing shoe and glove size and the need to enlarge rings. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Soft tissue and skin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular abnormalities include hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to high serum GH and IGF-1 concentrations, uncontrolled acromegaly is also associated with hyperinsulinism, insulin resistance, overt diabetes in 10 to 15 percent of cases, and impaired glucose tolerance in a further 50 percent. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acromegaly appear to be at increased risk for colon polyps, colon cancer, and other tumors. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Colonic effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mortality rate of patients with acromegaly appears to be increased, especially if strict biochemical control is not achieved. Death is primarily from cardiovascular disease.
