Premature infants fed human milk have reduced rates of urinary tract infections and sepsis than those who receive formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Possible explanations for these beneficial effects include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of maternal antibodies (ie, immunoglobulins G [IgG] and secretory A [sIgA]) in breast milk provided by the enteromammary immune system.

In observational studies, preterm infants fed formula have 3 to 10 times the rate of NEC compared with those fed human milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Randomized trials confirm that formula feeding is a risk factor for NEC compared with human milk feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In a systematic review, the typical risk ratio for formula feeding was 2.77 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Early initiation of human milk has particular benefits. In a study of 349 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, feeding of human milk during the first five days after birth was associated with a lower incidence of NEC, sepsis, or death during the first two months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. During days six through ten after birth, human milk was protective if it comprised 50 percent or more of enteral feeds. The protective effect of human milk appears to be dose-dependent, based on non-randomized studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p>Human milk components that appear to protect against NEC include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulins &ndash; The importance of immunoglobulins A (IgA) and IgG was demonstrated in a randomized trial in which oral administration of IgA and IgG in amounts similar to those contained in human milk reduced the incidence of NEC in formula-fed premature infants compared with controls (0 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Infants fed the immunoglobulin preparation had greater fecal excretion of IgA than did controls, suggesting the mixture provided local protection of the gastrointestinal tract. The fecal excretion rate of IgA in infants supplemented with IgA is similar to the excretion rate observed in premature infants fed human milk, and greater than the rate in formula-fed infants without supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acetylhydrolase &ndash; The presence of the enzyme acetylhydrolase antagonizes platelet-activating factor, a major trigger for NEC in premature infants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oligosaccharides &ndash; The oligosaccharide acts as a prebiotic constituent resulting in the development of a less pathogenic fecal flora.

This was shown in a randomized trial of 926 preterm infants who were fed either donor human milk or preterm formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among the 46 individuals available for follow-up as young adults, those fed exclusively human milk had favorable measures of cardiac structure and function, including increased left and right ventricular end-diastolic volume index and stroke volume index, compared with those who were fed exclusively formula. This is an interesting observation, but it should be noted that only a small number of the original cohort were followed to young adult age. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS OF HUMAN MILK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although human milk is the preferred form of nutrition for premature infants with numerous advantages over bovine-based formula, several factors may limit the ability of exclusive human milk feedings to meet the nutritional requirements of these infants. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate milk supply of the mother</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume restrictions that limit the intake of the infant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutrient limitations of human milk</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Inadequate supply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mother's milk production is often insufficient to provide exclusive human milk feedings for a premature infant. In one study, only 30 percent of mothers of extremely preterm infants were able to provide sufficient quantity of milk to meet their infant's needs throughout the hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Other infants have comorbid medical conditions that require fluid restriction, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia or patent ductus arteriosus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrient limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human milk is insufficient to meet the needs of the premature infant for certain essential nutrients. In particular, unfortified human milk does not supply sufficient quantities of protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional composition of human milk and preterm formula for the premature infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, other factors may lead to insufficient quantities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> variability of human milk content, especially differences in composition related to the length of lactation (eg, decreased protein content with increased length of lactation) and timing within a feed (foremilk versus hindmilk). In addition, the composition of human milk may be affected by storage and by the use of feeding tubes (adsorption of fats to the tubing). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">STRATEGIES TO MEET NUTRITIONAL NEEDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mother's own milk is the preferred form of nutrition for premature infants. It is important for each center to educate and support mothers to provide breast milk for their preterm infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast milk expression for the preterm infant&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breastfeeding the preterm infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, mother's own milk may be inadequate related to insufficient supply <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> insufficient quantity of nutrients to meet the nutritional needs of the premature infant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110683 \">table 1</a>). Therefore, many premature infants will need additional sources of nutrients, from human milk fortifiers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fortified donor human milk, or sometimes preterm formula. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3179064440\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use the following strategy to maximize the benefits of human milk feeding. This is consistent with recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/4,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23</a>], and the European and North American Societies for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mother's own milk is the first choice in preterm feeding, and strong efforts should be made to promote lactation. We use colostrum as oral care in the first few days after birth even before feedings are ordered. Feedings are initiated with unfortified, full-strength human milk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants who require increased nutrients or have volume restrictions, human milk (mother's milk or pasteurized milk from a donor) is fortified to increase caloric and nutrient intake. This typically applies to infants weighing &lt;1800 grams who require tube feeding. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Fortification of human milk'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When mother's own milk is not available or the supply is inadequate, the preferred alternative is pasteurized fortified donor human milk from an established milk bank that follows safety regulations for optimal milk collection, pasteurization, storage, and shipping. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Donor human milk'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm formula should be used only when mother's own milk and donor human milk from a reliable source are not available.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor human milk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When mother's own milk is unavailable despite adequate lactation support, pasteurized donor human milk from a reliable human milk bank is the preferred alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/4,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23-25</a>]. In our practice, we use this strategy for all infants weighing &lt;1500 grams and sometimes for those between 1500 and 1800 grams if they require tube feedings. It is also important for infants with severe gastrointestinal disorders or other underlying medical conditions that cause feeding intolerance. There are no clear guidelines for when to discontinue the use of donor human milk, but common practice is to continue until the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) decreases, typically between 32 and 34 weeks postmenstrual age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>If the mother's milk supply is insufficient, fortified mother's own milk is typically alternated with feeds of pasteurized donor human milk, as a bridge until she can provide sufficient milk to meet the infant's needs. The mother should be encouraged to provide her own milk whenever possible, using strategies to maximize milk production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-milk-expression-for-the-preterm-infant#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast milk expression for the preterm infant&quot;, section on 'Milk expression'</a>.)</p><p>Donor human milk provides many of the benefits of mother's own milk, including protection from NEC, although it tends to have lower protein, electrolytes, trace elements, and immunoactive factors than fresh milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. This is because it is typically donated later in lactation than mother's own milk and because of effects from pasteurization. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4208733157\"><span class=\"h3\">Donor milk versus preterm formula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with preterm formula, donor human milk is associated with a lower risk of feeding intolerance and NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This finding has been consistently shown in studies that used exclusively human milk (ie, donor milk with a human milk-based fortifier) compared with formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/12,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,28-31</a>]. When the donor human milk was fortified with a bovine milk-based fortifier, a protective effect on NEC is less clear and there may be more abnormalities in biochemical indices of nutritional status and a slower rate of growth compared with formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These observations have led to investigations into whether the type of fortifier (derived from human milk, bovine milk, or hydrolyzed proteins) affects the medical and nutritional outcomes of infants fed human milk, discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1563670358\" class=\"local\">'Type of fortifier'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29793131\"><span class=\"h3\">Source of donor milk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quality control is important in the collection, pasteurization, storage, and distribution of donor human milk but adds to the cost of donor milk. Established human milk banks screen potential donors to reduce risks. They also pasteurize the human milk to reduce the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], which also decreases the activity of many of the functional bioactive factors in milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].

We continue fortification until the infant is feeding orally and is growing well without any evidence of nutritional issues (eg, abnormal alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, or blood urea nitrogen [BUN]). Most neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) use a similar protocol but specifics of timing, composition, and advancement of feeds vary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to enteral nutrition in the premature infant&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The addition of HMF to human milk increases the concentration of energy, protein and minerals, and increases the rate of weight gain and linear growth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110683 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/47-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-53</a>].

There have been several changes in HMFs in the United States. Originally, commercial HMFs were in powder form and the protein source was intact bovine proteins. Now, HMFs available in the United States are liquid preparations that contain protein hydrolysates and provide a greater intake of protein, as well as carbohydrate, lipid, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, zinc, copper, and multivitamins. A variety of fortifiers are available globally and differ markedly from one another. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protein source</strong> &ndash; In the United States there are generally three HMF preparations, two derived from bovine milk with a protein hydrolysate and one derived from pasteurized human milk, containing intact human milk protein. HMFs made from human milk may have advantages over the traditional bovine-based fortifiers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bovine milk-derived fortifiers &ndash; Most studies using bovine-derived fortifiers suggested that there were no adverse effects on feeding tolerance or risk of NEC compared with unfortified human milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/51,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,53</a>]. These studies did not compare bovine milk-derived fortifiers to fortifiers derived from human milk. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Human milk-derived fortifiers &ndash; Fortifiers derived from pasteurized donor human milk have been developed and their use is increasing. Several studies suggest advantages of exclusively human milk feedings, consisting of mother's own milk or donor milk, plus human milk-derived fortifier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/12,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,28,29</a>]. The study design did not isolate the effect of the fortifier versus formula supplements. However, one retrospective study found improved growth and lower rates of NEC in infants fed exclusively human milk compared with those fed human milk with a bovine fortifier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Micronutrient content</strong> &ndash; Micronutrient and vitamin content of fortifiers, especially those used outside of the United States, may vary and therefore individualization of supplements might be needed. The iron and other components of milk fortifiers do not affect the antimicrobial properties of the milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>]. Fortifiers are designed to provide supplemental calcium and phosphorus to meet the high needs of a premature infant; the content of these minerals differs somewhat between the United States and Europe.

Powdered HMF are typically designed to contribute an additional 0.35 to 1 g lipid per 100 mL prepared milk (in addition to the lipid content of the human milk itself), and liquid HMF can contribute as much as 2.3 g lipid per 100 mL prepared milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

Premature infants fed human milk have reduced rates of urinary tract infections, sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) than those who receive formula. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Advantages of human milk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The quantity of milk supplied by a mother is often inadequate to meet the needs of a preterm infant. Moreover, premature infants often need higher concentrations of nutrients than is available from mother's milk, due to high nutrient needs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> volume restriction. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of human milk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When mother's own milk is not available or the supply is inadequate, the preferred alternative is pasteurized fortified donor human milk from an established milk bank, especially for infants weighing &lt;1500 grams at birth. Preterm formula should only be used when mother's own milk and donor human milk from a reliable source are not available. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Donor human milk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fortification is added to the human milk (from the mother or a donor) to increase caloric and nutrient intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110683 \">table 1</a>). We routinely fortify feeds for infants weighing &lt;1500 grams, and also for those between 1500 and 1800 grams if they require tube feedings. Most neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) use a similar protocol but specifics of timing, composition, and advancement of feeds vary.
