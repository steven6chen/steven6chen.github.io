But if you have dysphagia, you might have a serious medical problem that needs to be treated right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29125293\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes dysphagia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysphagia is usually caused by a problem in the upper part of your digestive tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55616 \">figure 1</a>). Often, the problem is in the esophagus, tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. But it can also happen because of a problem in the mouth or throat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29125308\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of dysphagia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not being able to swallow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain while swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like food is stuck in your throat or chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing or gagging while swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drooling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble speaking</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29125323\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you have any of the above symptoms. Do so right away if you are unable to swallow your own saliva and are drooling or have trouble speaking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29125338\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for dysphagia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask about your symptoms. Other test might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">barium</a> X-ray &ndash; For this test, you drink a thick liquid called a &quot;barium solution.&quot; It coats the inside of your esophagus. The barium shows up on X-rays, so the doctor can see any problems in the esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A swallowing study &ndash; For this test, you eat different foods coated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">barium</a>. X-rays taken throughout the test show if you have problems with the muscles in your mouth or throat. This test is also called a &quot;videofluoroscopy.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper endoscopy &ndash; For this test, the doctor puts a thin, flexible tube into your mouth, down your throat, and into your esophagus. The tube (called an endoscope) has a camera and a light on it, so it allows the doctor to see inside the esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manometry &ndash; This test measures the pressure at different places inside your esophagus. To do this, a small tube that senses pressure is inserted through your nose, down your throat, and into your esophagus. The results of the test can tell your doctor how well the muscles that help you swallow are working.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29125353\"><span class=\"h1\">How is dysphagia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on what is causing the dysphagia.</p><p>If you have dysphagia because of a problem in your mouth and the upper part of your throat, your doctor might refer you to a speech or swallowing specialist. This person can teach you exercises to help you swallow, and might also suggest ways to modify your diet.</p><p>If the problem affects your esophagus, treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal dilation &ndash; For this procedure, the doctor uses an endoscope (see above) with a special balloon on the end to gently stretch and widen your esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Doctors can do surgery to remove any tumors or other abnormal tissue in the esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Medicines used to treat dysphagia include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines that reduce stomach acid, such as proton pump inhibitors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78918 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines to treat an infection of the esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29125368\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-esophagitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Eosinophilic esophagitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=myasthenia-gravis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Myasthenia gravis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=esophageal-stricture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Esophageal stricture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
