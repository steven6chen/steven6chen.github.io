It can spread easily from person to person. The medical term for whooping cough is &quot;pertussis.&quot;</p><p>Most people get vaccines in childhood to prevent whooping cough. (Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections.) Doctors recommend that babies and young children get 5 doses of the vaccine. They also recommend that children ages 11 to 12 and most adults get 1 dose of the vaccine. Pregnant women should get 1 dose during each pregnancy. It's especially important that adults and children who are around newborn babies get the vaccine.</p><p>But children and adults can still get whooping cough. Babies can get the infection before they get all of their vaccine doses. Teens and adults can get it if they don't get their vaccines, or if it has been a few years since their last dose of the vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27018437\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of whooping cough?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early on, whooping cough usually causes sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and other cold symptoms. It also causes a mild cough.</p><p>After 1 to 2 weeks, the cold symptoms get better, but the cough gets worse. People have severe coughing attacks. During these attacks, children can gag, choke, or have trouble breathing. People can also vomit from coughing so hard.</p><p>After 2 to 6 weeks, the cough starts to get better. But it can take weeks to months for the cough to go away completely.</p><p>Whooping cough gets its name because many people make a &quot;whoop&quot; sound when they breathe in after a coughing attack. But not everyone with whooping cough makes this noise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27018452\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor should be able to tell if you have whooping cough by talking with you, hearing your cough, and doing an exam.</p><p>He or she might also do tests that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing a sample of mucus from the back of your nose or throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27018467\"><span class=\"h1\">How is whooping cough treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors usually treat whooping cough with antibiotic medicines. The medicines can help the infection get better faster and keep it from spreading to others. Doctors can use different antibiotics to treat whooping cough, depending on the person's age.</p><p>People living with the infected person might also need to take antibiotics, even if they aren't sick. This can help keep them from getting the infection.</p><p>Most babies younger than 4 months need to be treated in the hospital. That's because the infection is very serious and can be deadly in babies. In the hospital, doctors can watch a baby closely and give him or her oxygen, fluids, and nutrition (if necessary).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27018482\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To feel better, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get plenty of rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink plenty of fluids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat small meals to avoid vomiting after coughing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid being around people who are smoking</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27018496\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child has whooping cough, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stops breathing or has a hard time breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a seizure</p><p/><p>Let the emergency workers know that your child has whooping cough so they can avoid getting or spreading the infection.</p><p>Call the doctor or nurse if you or your child has whooping cough and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets a high fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomits over and over again</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets dehydrated &ndash; Dehydration is when the body loses too much water. It can make people feel thirsty, tired, dizzy, or confused, and have dark yellow urine.</p><p/><p>You should also call the doctor or nurse if you think you or your child has whooping cough. That way, you can get treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27018511\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I prevent spreading whooping cough?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cover your mouth when you cough, or wear a mask.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands often.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid being near babies and young children until you have been on antibiotics for 5 days. If you work with young children or babies, do not return to work until you have been on antibiotics for 5 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure the other people in your home get the pertussis vaccine if they haven't had it. If your child has whooping cough, make sure the people who live with and take care of him or her get the pertussis vaccine if they haven't had it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not let your child return to school or day care until the doctor or nurse says it's OK.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27018526\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bronchitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute bronchitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tdap-vaccine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tdap vaccine (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
