Rarely, acquired lesions, including endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, and carcinoid heart disease, involve the pulmonic valve. Identification and characterization of these pathologies requires thorough echocardiographic interrogation and consideration of clinical context. Finally, evaluation of flow through the pulmonic valve and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) are essential elements for evaluating hemodynamics. Careful measurements can yield significant information regarding flow, pressure and resistance in the pulmonary circulatory bed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17588891\"><span class=\"h1\">VIEWS FOR EVALUATION OF THE PULMONIC VALVE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17588898\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic transthoracic views</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interrogation of the pulmonic valve by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) begins with the parasternal short axis at the level of the aortic valve, where pulmonic valve anatomy can be examined for thickening, doming, or vegetation. Color flow Doppler is placed over the RVOT to detect flow acceleration or regurgitation. Then, using both continuous wave and pulse wave Doppler at the level of the pulmonary valve, velocities across the pulmonary valve in systole and diastole and peak velocities around the RVOT can be measured (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81698\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81698 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77775\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77775 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70165\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70165 \">image 2</a>). Several cycles of these views should be recorded to account for small variations in velocities during the respiratory cycle. M-mode through the pulmonary valve can also be obtained in this view. Tilting the probe in a slight cranial direction gives a clearer view of both the pulmonic valve and the proximal pulmonary artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64091\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64091 \">image 3</a>). Color Doppler demonstrates flows proximal and distal to the valve and pulsed and continuous wave Doppler records the waveforms from that flow. The valve and artery may also be viewed from an orthogonal plane to assure complete interrogation of the structures and the most axial flow signals. Although the apical and subcostal views can be useful in imaging the right ventricle as it relates to the pulmonic valve and arteries (and occasionally allows for visualization of the pulmonic valve), it is often difficult to adequately image the pulmonary arterial system in these views. For further imaging of the branch pulmonary arteries, the suprasternal notch view with visualization of the aortic arch may be used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76850\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76850 \">image 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17588999\"><span class=\"h2\">Three-dimensional transthoracic views</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If there is excellent visualization of the pulmonic valve in two dimensions, a three-dimensional reconstruction may be helpful in further defining valvular and proximal arterial anatomy. This may be especially useful when considering interventions on prosthetic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Three-dimensional echocardiography may also allow more accurate measurement of the pulmonic valve annulus area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], which can be useful in calculating shunts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589022\"><span class=\"h2\">Transesophageal echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pulmonic valve can be imaged from several views [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. First, it can be obtained by turning the probe counterclockwise from the mid-to-high esophageal ascending aorta long-axis view (approximately 110 to 130&deg;). At this position, the main pulmonary artery is seen with the pulmonic valve in the far field. Spectral Doppler interrogations can be performed here. At the mid-to-high esophageal ascending aortic short-axis view (approximately 40 to 60&deg;), both the RV inflow and outflow (including the pulmonic valve) can be visualized. Here, two of the pulmonic leaflets can be seen. In the presence of calcific aortic stenosis or aortic prosthesis, acoustic noise can limit visualization of the pulmonic valve, which is immediately anterior to the aortic valve. </p><p>Transgastric views of pulmonic valve are used primarily for spectral Doppler interrogations (such as when calculation Qp:Qs), as the pulmonic flow is most parallel to the Doppler beam. With the transducer in the stomach, clockwise rotation results in pulmonic valve visualization, where Doppler measurements can be made.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2445416364\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracardiac echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is being increasingly used to image the pulmonic valve during transcatheter pulmonic valve replacement. In a study of 35 patients undergoing transcatheter pulmonic valve replacement, there was reasonable correlation of transpulmonic gradients between ICE and TTE, with ICE-derived gradients lower than TTE-derived gradients, possibly due to patient&rsquo;s sedation status during ICE image acquisition, high-frequency sound waves with ICE, as well as Doppler alignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589041\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONIC VALVE STENOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonic valve stenosis is primarily diagnosed using Doppler echocardiography, although traditional two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589048\"><span class=\"h2\">Two-dimensional echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Basic two-dimensional TTE views can show the anatomic features associated with isolated valvular pulmonic stenosis, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right ventricular hypertrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic doming of the valve</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valve thickening &ndash; Thickening can range from mild in the young patient to severe calcification in the elderly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post stenotic dilation of the main pulmonary artery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589067\"><span class=\"h2\">Color Doppler echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Color flow Doppler signals around the point of stenosis will show aliased flow and are used to identify accelerating blood flow across the stenotic lesion. These images can also help target specific areas for interrogation by spectral Doppler.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589082\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous wave Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A continuous wave Doppler signal across the area of stenosis is a key component of any examination in pulmonic stenosis. The peak flow velocity across the valve is measured and converted to a peak pressure gradient via the modified Bernoulli equation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81698\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81698 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57785\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57785 \">waveform 1</a>). Of note, although pulsed wave Doppler can be used to quantify velocities, due to the Nyquist limit, it can quantify only the mildest degrees of obstruction.</p><p>Unlike aortic stenosis, where velocities are used to generate peak pressure, mean pressure and valve area that determine severity and drive management, the hemodynamic severity of pulmonic stenosis is usually defined solely by the peak pressure gradient across the valve. To calculate this pressure drop, peak velocities (V) obtained from continuous wave Doppler signals are converted into a pressure gradient by the simplified Bernoulli equation:</p><p>Peak gradient (mmHg)&nbsp;=&nbsp;4&nbsp;x&nbsp;v<sup>2</sup></p><p>Note that pre-stenotic RVOT velocity is ignored as it is usually less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span>. However, in so-called &quot;double chamber right ventricle&quot; when a dynamic prevalvular gradient is present in the distal RVOT, this accelerated velocity must be factored into the equation. </p><p>Severe pulmonic stenosis is defined as peak velocity &gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> or peak gradient &gt;64 mmHg, as noted in the 2014 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> valve guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Anatomically, the pulmonic valve may be thickened, distorted, or calcified leaflets, with reduced leaflet excursion. Right ventricular hypertrophy, post-stenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery, and sometimes right ventricular or atrial enlargement are hemodynamic consequences of severe pulmonic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although only mentioned in passing in the <span class=\"nowrap\">EAE/ASE</span> guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], RV enlargement is considered by some clinicians as an important means of interpreting the systolic transpulmonic gradient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589167\"><span class=\"h2\">M-mode echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>M-mode findings in pulmonic stenosis are usually limited to the occurrence of an exaggerated &quot;A wave&quot; during diastole. The A wave is due to a powerful right atrial contraction that because of low diastolic pulmonary artery pressure, is able to open (or at least dome) the stenotic pulmonary valve in late diastole. The A wave is most pronounced during inspiration and accounts for the disappearance of the pulmonic ejection sound at that point in the respiratory cycle. This behavior makes the pulmonic ejection sound the only right-sided event that diminishes with inspiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589174\"><span class=\"h2\">Transesophageal echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When rare anatomic variants involving the right ventricular outflow tract are suspected, TEE can provide significant information about the right ventricular anatomy. Case reports of thrombosis after a gunshot wound, sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, subarterial ventricular septal defects, and membranous ventricular septal aneurysm in the setting of L-transposition have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and visualized primarily by TEE. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589193\"><span class=\"h2\">Other considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a pressure gradient across the pulmonic valve is strongly suggestive of pulmonic stenosis. However, it is important to eliminate other causes of increased flow velocity. When high RVOT velocities are encountered, examine the RVOT carefully to seek dynamic muscular subvalvular stenosis proximal to the valve that provides evidence of a double chamber right ventricle. A ventricular septal defect (with or without evidence of a double chamber right ventricle) can introduce flow acceleration into the right ventricular outflow tract. Interrogating the septum in the apical two and four chamber can help to exclude this diagnosis. Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction may also result from extrinsic compression due to postoperative hematoma, thoracic tumors or a pericardial cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and these possibilities should be entertained in the appropriate clinical situation.

Pulmonic valve carcinoid, for example, manifests as a short, thickened valve with both stenosis and regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Endocarditis is suggested by a vegetation-like mobile mass, and congenital dysplasia of the pulmonic valve is associated with thickening of the leaflets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/5,6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,9,10</a>]. Additionally, dilation of the right ventricle is an important adjunctive clue to hemodynamically significant PR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589314\"><span class=\"h2\">Color Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of antegrade and retrograde flow in the short axis view across the pulmonic valve with visualization of both the RVOT and the proximal pulmonary artery gives the most information about PR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79177\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef79177 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p>Trivial or trace pulmonary regurgitation is normally present in a high percentage of healthy people and is almost never clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A small amount of diastolic flow into the RVOT is consistent with this diagnosis. Distinguishing between mild and more significant (moderate to severe) regurgitation can be more challenging and requires closer attention to the morphology of the pulmonic regurgitation jet. Jet characteristics important in delineating regurgitation severity include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vena contracta &ndash; The diameter of the narrowest portion of the pulmonic regurgitation jet as it crosses the pulmonary valve varies with severity proportionally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume of RVOT occupied with regurgitation and the degree of retrograde jet penetration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percentage of time in diastole occupied with regurgitation &ndash; Severe pulmonic regurgitation will have a dense jet that rapidly decelerates so that regurgitant flow ends around mid-diastole while mild to moderate pulmonic regurgitation flow persists throughout diastole; occasionally, a jet of mild pulmonic regurgitation will decelerate quickly, but its signal density is low. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, velocity of flow is not proportional to severity of regurgitation. Higher velocities suggested by aliasing of the color Doppler signal or by high continuous wave Doppler peak velocity reflect higher pressure gradients between RVOT and pulmonary circulation. Higher velocities are associated with pulmonary hypertension.</p><p/><p>The following are characteristics of severe PR: abnormally distorted or absent valve leaflets, annular dilatation, color jet filling the RVOT, dense laminar continuous wave Doppler jet that descends steeply and may terminate abruptly, and the associated hemodynamic consequence of right ventricular enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Symptoms may be none or variable depending on cause of PR and right ventricular function.</p><p>Pulmonic to aortic flow ratio by pulsed wave Doppler is greatly increased with severe pulmonic regurgitation (as flow across the pulmonic valve consists of both forward cardiac output and regurgitant flow), as recognized in the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging Recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The pressure half time cutoff reported for severe PR is &lt;100 ms, and the jet width ratio is categorized as &gt;50 to 65 percent.</p><p>In our experience, color Doppler is not the best indicator of severe PR, as the regurgitant flow may terminate early in diastole. Doppler will show the dense regurgitant flow with a steep slope that terminates abruptly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589382\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous or pulsed wave Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most regurgitant lesions can be imaged with continuous or pulse wave Doppler signals across the pulmonic valve. Density of the pulmonic regurgitation signal increases with increasing regurgitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67037\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67037 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55374\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55374 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70165\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70165 \">image 2</a>). Additionally, in severe pulmonic regurgitation, rapid equalization of pressures between the pulmonary artery and the RVOT early in diastole results in rapid termination of regurgitant flow around mid-diastole. On Doppler this signature of severity is seen as an abrupt return to baseline of the signal well before the onset of the next systole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70165\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70165 \">image 2</a>). The rapid decrease in slope of the PR signal that is typical of severe pulmonic regurgitation may be masked by fast heart rates that shorten diastole and, in doing so, diminish regurgitant fraction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589457\"><span class=\"h2\">Three-dimensional echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three-dimensional assessment of pulmonic valve anatomy can be helpful, although the technical factors limiting visualization in two dimensions affect three dimensions to a greater extent. Quantification of the pulmonary regurgitant jet and specifically the cross sectional area of its vena contracta may be better achieved with three-dimensional Doppler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Three-dimensional echocardiography may also have a role in measuring the diameter of the pulmonary artery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589476\"><span class=\"h2\">Transesophageal echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the relatively distal position of the pulmonary valve with respect to the esophagus, it can be difficult to accurately determine the severity of pulmonary regurgitation with this modality. Additionally, visualization of the pulmonary artery is almost always more complete with transthoracic studies. As such, TEE has limited utility in the evaluation of pulmonic regurgitation. However, for supplemental anatomic information about the pulmonic valve, TEE can be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589483\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically significant pulmonary regurgitation is rare and the differential diagnosis is fairly limited. As such, understanding the clinical context prior to performing the echo is extremely important, and the exam should be guided by the specific clinical question being asked.</p><p>In adults, the most common cause of moderate PR is pulmonary hypertension.

Of note, in the parasternal view in adults, the lateral wall of the main pulmonary artery is usually not well visualized because of overlying lung. In children, the success rate of imaging the lateral wall and measuring the transverse diameter of the main pulmonary artery is much higher. Since the right pulmonary artery is readily imaged, doubling its area has been used as a rough substitute measurement for the main pulmonary artery. However, this method awaits further confirmation.</p><p>Anatomic evaluation of the pulmonary artery is important in several disease processes. In the presence of an atrial septal defect, the size of the main artery gives some indication of the duration or magnitude of the shunt.

Measurements utilizing the tricuspid valve and right ventricle are discussed in the following topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-assessment-of-the-right-heart#H9033342\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic assessment of the right heart&quot;, section on 'Hemodynamics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17589943\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary pressures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler interrogation of the pulmonic valve provides a wealth of information about pulmonary hemodynamics. First, pulsed wave Doppler velocities across the pulmonic valve when integrated over time provide a velocity-time integral, or velocity time integral (VTI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77775\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77775 \">image 1</a>). This well-validated technique gives an estimation of the stroke distance during one beat through the pulmonic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18</a>]. If multiplied by the area of the RVOT, a stroke volume can be calculated. Multiplying this value by heart rate provides a cardiac output in <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>. In practice, as the area of the RVOT is similar in most people, the stroke distance (as calculated by the VTI) is a reasonable estimate of right ventricular cardiac output (over a range of normal heart rates). Reduced VTI across the pulmonic valve (&lt;17 cm) has been shown to predict heart failure hospitalization and mortality independent of clinical and other echocardiographic parameters among individuals with coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Technically, proper positioning of the Doppler sample volume can be assured by choosing a spot across the pulmonary valve where the opening valve signal is more intense than the closing. If only a closing signal is seen, the sample volume is not across the valve but in the RVOT. This malpositioning may result in an artificially low VTI because the RVOT is wider than the diameter of the passage between the PV leaflets. </p><p>Noninvasive measurement of pulmonary arterial pressures requires a continuous wave Doppler of the pulmonary regurgitant jet. The pulmonary arterial end diastolic pressure (PA EDP) is defined by the velocity immediately after the atrial notch on the R wave at the end of diastole in the PR signal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55374\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55374 \">image 6</a>). Evaluation of this end diastolic pulmonary regurgitation gradient provides prognostic value and indicates an increased risk of heart failure and mortality when the gradient exceeds 5 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] or 9 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. If more precise calculation of the PA end diastolic pressure is desired, the Bernoulli equation (pressure gradient = 4v<sup>2</sup>) is used to estimate the PA diastolic pressure: pressure gradient + baseline diastolic pressure in the right ventricle (which is approximately right atrial pressure) = PA diastolic pressure. </p><p>To calculate mean pulmonary pressures, the peak pulmonary regurgitant velocity and right atrial pressure may be used<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. By again using Bernoulli&rsquo;s principle (4 x peak PR velocity) and adding the right atrial pressure, a close approximation of pulmonary artery mean pressure is obtained. Pulmonary arterial pressure measurements are more commonly obtained using the tricuspid regurgitant jet.</p><p>To calculate the mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure in the physiologic range of heart rates, the following equation can be used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean PA pressure = [(2 x PA diastolic pressure) + PA systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">pressure]/3</span></p><p/><p>Solving for PA systolic pressure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PA systolic pressure = (3 x Mean PA pressure) &ndash; (2 x PA diastolic pressure)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17590020\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary vascular resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calculations of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) using Doppler-derived pulmonary systolic flow are especially useful in monitoring patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pulmonic-valve-and-pulmonary-artery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].
