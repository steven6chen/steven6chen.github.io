In addition, a definitive diagnosis of ovarian cancer requires surgery; however, many procedures performed for a pelvic mass ultimately identify a benign adnexal mass. </p><p>Use of serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer is an active area of investigation. Biomarkers or panels of biomarkers are generally used in combination with each other or with other findings (eg, ultrasound). Only a few biomarkers are commercially available. Cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) has been the focus of most investigations and is used most extensively. Other diagnostic tests for epithelial ovarian cancer include human epididymis protein (HE4), the OVA1 panel, and the Risk of Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA).</p><p>There is evidence that high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinomas should be considered as a single clinical entity due to their shared clinical behavior and treatment. There is also accumulating evidence of a common pathogenesis for these carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

A tumor maker is a biomarker specific for malignancy. The United States National Institutes of Health defines a biomarker as &quot;a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic response to a therapeutic intervention.&quot; For epithelial ovarian cancer, this may include patient symptoms, physical examination, imaging studies, or laboratory tests. Biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer have been identified in serum, urine, ovarian cyst fluids, ascites, and other body fluids. In this topic review, the term biomarkers will refer specifically to serum biomarkers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19406252\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) presents several diagnostic challenges. EOC is most commonly diagnosed at a late stage, which contributes to its poor prognosis, and the difficulty differentiating between benign and malignant adnexal masses results in many surgical procedures for masses that are ultimately determined to be benign. </p><p>Lymph node involvement or distant metastases are present in 78 percent of women with EOC at time of diagnosis, with a five-year survival rate of only approximately 30 percent or lower (compared with approximately 80 to 90 percent for women with disease confined to the ovaries) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64569 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Symptoms of ovarian cancer are usually present, but are often nonspecific and do not usually result in diagnosis at an early stage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-detection-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-role-of-symptom-recognition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer: Role of symptom recognition&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Definitive diagnosis of ovarian cancer requires surgery, and many procedures performed to evaluate a pelvic mass ultimately identify a benign process. As an example, in a large ovarian cancer screening randomized trial, among 570 women who underwent surgical evaluation for suspected ovarian cancer, 20 cases of malignancy were found (3.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, improving the methods for distinguishing malignant from benign masses would avoid unnecessary surgery. </p><p>Currently, no serum biomarker is both highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of EOC. Thus, investigators have combined serum markers or used multimodality strategies to improve the detection of malignancy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2990065\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPERTIES OF BIOMARKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This section will discuss the biochemical properties of serum biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H616782337\"><span class=\"h2\">Individual biomarkers</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H616782344\"><span class=\"h3\">Cancer antigen 125</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) as a biomarker for EOC was first described in 1983 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. CA 125 is currently the most widely used biomarker for EOC, and it is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for monitoring response to therapy in women with known EOC. CA 125 is often used off-label for evaluation of an adnexal mass alone or combined with other serum biomarkers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The CA 125 antigen is a large transmembrane glycoprotein derived from both coelomic (pericardium, pleura, peritoneum) and m&uuml;llerian (fallopian tubal, endometrial, endocervical) epithelia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The antigen complex contains two major domains, A and B. A portion of the extracellular domain includes repeat sequences that bind the OC125 and M11 monoclonal antibodies. The original CA 125 test reacts with OC125, and the newer CA 125 II test utilizes both the OC125 and M11 moieties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

CA 125 values may increase during the menses, but this increase is likely to be clinically insignificant. Ideally, the blood for testing should be obtained during the first half of the cycle to minimize the fluctuation, but as long as subsequent testing is done at the same time of the cycle, serial monitoring will not be affected regardless of when the blood is drawn.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1675676\"><span class=\"h3\">Human epididymis protein 4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) assay was approved by the FDA in 2008 for monitoring for recurrent or progressive disease in patients with EOC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The AUCs for other predictions were: benign versus borderline (0.85), benign versus stage I ovarian cancer (0.92), benign versus stage II to IV cancer (0.99), benign versus secondary metastatic (0.95), borderline versus stage I cancer (0.75), and stage II to IV versus secondary metastatic (0.82). </p><p>The study was reported by a group of British researchers and the model was compared to the RMI, since this is a standard ovarian cancer prediction tool in the United Kingdom. Based upon the validation data set, for discrimination between benign and malignant tumors, the RMI showed a decrease in AUC (0.88) and sensitivity at a 10 percent malignancy risk threshold (67 percent sensitivity), but an increase in specificity (91 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>The ability to distinguish between a benign mass versus an early stage ovarian cancer appears promising, but the low specificity may result in unnecessary surgery for benign masses. This specificity decreases if a lower malignancy risk threshold is used (for a malignancy risk of 5 percent, specificity was 59 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]), and many experts would advise surgery for women with a risk at that level or lower. Also, cancer prevalence and inclusion of the type of center (oncology versus other hospital) may impact the results. This depends upon the health care system, the number of oncology centers, the threshold for referral, and whether a center with a specific gynecologic oncology unit also includes general gynecology services. As with other models, this is applied only to women with an adnexal mass planned for surgery. Thus, a clinician has already made the judgment that surgery is required. In this model, the judgment regarding referral to an oncology center is also included. Thus, the model may be less helpful for clinicians in the key decision of whether to refer to an oncologist. The ADNEX model requires further study for validation and for comparison to other prediction tools. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19406350\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum biomarkers are used as part of the evaluation for malignancy in women with an adnexal mass. This evaluation also includes a medical history, physical examination, and imaging studies. The clinician uses this information to arrive at the degree of clinical suspicion that a mass is malignant. Based upon this, the clinician decides whether the patient should undergo diagnostic surgery or continued surveillance. For masses that are highly suspicious for ovarian cancer, referral to a gynecologic oncologist is appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55063\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55063 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>General principles of the evaluation and management of an adnexal mass are discussed in detail separately.

There may be a role for serum markers in the assessment of these women.</p><p>Preoperative measurement of biomarkers in women with possible ovarian cancer has other potential functions. A baseline level is established for use for further monitoring during and after treatment. In addition, biomarkers may play a role in predicting whether optimal cytoreduction is feasible.

OVA1, Overa, and the Risk of Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) have been studied only in women who have already been evaluated and for whom surgery is planned, and thus likely have a higher prevalence of ovarian cancer than the general population of women with an adnexal mass. In the absence of data regarding the use of OVA1, Overa, and ROMA in the initial evaluation of an adnexal mass, we do not recommend use of these tests to decide whether to proceed with surgical exploration for an adnexal mass. </p><p>CA 125 adds limited information to the decision to proceed with surgery. It has a low sensitivity overall, and particularly for detection of early-stage disease. In addition, it has a low specificity, particularly in premenopausal women, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H695605\" class=\"local\">'CA 125'</a> above.)</p><p>In premenopausal women, the decision whether to proceed with surgical evaluation of an adnexal mass is a diagnostic dilemma. Pelvic ultrasound can identify ovarian masses with characteristics of malignancy, but many benign tumors in younger women also have complex ovarian morphology. For some women, the decision to proceed with surgery remains uncertain, even after consideration of the ultrasound findings combined with risk factors, symptoms, and physical examination. In such cases, many clinicians draw a serum CA 125. However, the result is informative only if it is very elevated. The sensitivity and specificity of CA 125 is low in general, and particularly in premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Many benign conditions found in this population are associated with a slightly elevated CA 125 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81621 \">table 2</a>). The definition of a very elevated CA 125 is not well established; a level of &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL</span> has been proposed, but is supported by few data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Ultimately, referral to a gynecologic oncologist is appropriate for a premenopausal woman with an adnexal mass who have a very elevated CA 125 or for whom there remains diagnostic uncertainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Thus, a CA 125 level alone without other information is not useful for determining which patients should proceed to surgery. If a CA 125 is drawn, the patient should be counseled about its limitations.</p><p>The risk of ovarian cancer is significantly higher in postmenopausal than premenopausal women. Surgical exploration is typically performed for most complex ovarian masses in postmenopausal women. Exceptions to this are apparently benign masses that are stable in size and appearance (eg, a mass with an appearance consistent with an endometrioma that was documented prior to menopause). Ovarian cysts with a simple sonographic appearance (unilocular, thin walls, anechoic fluid) that are &lt;10 cm in diameter are unlikely to be malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. In our practice, for postmenopausal patients with a simple cyst, we draw a serum CA 125, and if the result is &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL</span> and no symptoms or risk factors associated with ovarian cancer are present, we follow with serial ultrasound.</p><p>Prior to surgical exploration, another indication for drawing a CA 125 is as a baseline to monitor response to therapy, if ovarian cancer is ultimately diagnosed.
