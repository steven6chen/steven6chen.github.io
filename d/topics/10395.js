The rationale for activities focused on LDL-C reduction is based upon epidemiologic data documenting a continuous, positive, graded relationship between LDL-C concentration and CVD events and mortality and evidence that lowering of LDL-C in patients across a broad range of LDL-C levels reduces CVD events in patients with and without CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

The absolute magnitude of benefit is typically lower than in secondary prevention.

The United Kingdom Lipid Clinics Programme study of 2508 subjects found that, with diet alone, 60 percent of subjects had a mean reduction in body weight of 1.8 percent, which was associated with 5 to 7 percent reductions in serum total and LDL-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In occasional patients with poor baseline diets, marked dietary change can lower LDL-C by as much as 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Although there were no significant changes in HDL-C in any group, there were significant reductions in LDL-C in both men and women (14.5 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [0.38 and 0.52 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L],</span> respectively) in the diet plus exercise group compared with control or diet alone and, in men, in the diet plus exercise group compared with exercise alone.</p><p>The clinical benefits from LDL-C reduction from lifestyle modification may be evident within 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The individual response to a cholesterol-lowering diet depends upon many factors; some of the response is genetically determined, and increased body mass index is associated with less response to dietary change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Patients who are referred to a dietitian may have greater success in the short term with lowering LDL-C compared with patients who receive dietary counseling by clinicians, although long-term compliance with dietary therapy is inadequate for both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p>Despite these benefits on LDL-C in primary prevention, there is limited evidence that lifestyle modifications improve cardiovascular outcomes. In the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) in 12,866 high-risk men, an intervention that included dietary advice to reduce cholesterol levels did not significantly reduce coronary heart disease mortality (1.8 versus 1.9 percent) or all-cause mortality (4.1 versus 4.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, the differences in achieved total cholesterol levels between the groups (generally 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [0.13 to 0.26 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> were probably too small to expect significant effects on mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to determine which patients should make an attempt to lower their LDL-C, their risk for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events needs to be assessed using risk evaluation tools that take into account more than the baseline LDL-C. Cardiovascular risk should be calculated using validated risk <span class=\"nowrap\">models/calculators</span>. Patients and their providers can then decide whether a 20 to 30 percent relative risk reduction, which is a reasonable expectation for statin therapy, translates into an absolute risk reduction large enough to be worth the cost, burdens, and potential side effects of daily therapy. We recommend statin therapy to most patients with a 10-year risk of 7.5 to 10 percent or greater. This range is consistent with many guideline recommendations. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations of others'</a> below.) </p><p>Recommendations for the use of risk calculators are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-risk-calculators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although we recommend CVD risk calculation for most patients, we recommend therapy to lower LDL-C in a majority of individuals with an LDL-C &gt;190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> independent of their overall risk. For young women of childbearing age who wish to become pregnant, we carefully discuss the potential benefits and risks with the patient. Many of these individuals will have heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment#H3331381596\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial hypercholesterolemia in adults: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Heterozygous individuals'</a>.)</p><p>Lipid-lowering therapy with statins reduces relative cardiovascular risk by approximately 20 to 30 percent regardless of baseline LDL-C. (See <a href=\"#H2629267076\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for LDL-C lowering in primary prevention'</a> above.) The absolute benefit of treatment will be proportional to the underlying absolute risk. It should be noted that statins have not been well-studied for such a benefit in patients with very low baseline LDL-C levels (eg, below 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> but very few such patients would be expected to have a high enough absolute risk to justify statin therapy. Determining when the benefits of treatment outweigh its burdens (costs, adverse effects) requires determination of the patient's future CVD risk.</p><p>The following are two patient examples for which the decision to start statin therapy may differ despite both patients having the same baseline LDL-C:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 45-year-old non-smoking normotensive woman with an LDL-C of 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> has a 10-year risk of a myocardial infarction of approximately 1 percent. This could likely be reduced by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points if she were treated with a statin daily for 10 years. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 60-year-old non-smoking normotensive man with an LDL-C of 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and an HDL-C of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> has a 10-year risk of a myocardial infarction of approximately 12 percent. Use of a statin would reduce this risk to 8 to 9 percent, a 3 to 4 percentage point reduction. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific populations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Young patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data on the safety of statins over decades of therapy. It is also uncertain whether long-term treatment leads to better outcomes compared with postponing treatment until the patient's cardiovascular risk rises to an absolute level at which treatment becomes warranted. Notably, statins are contraindicated in pregnant women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration&quot;, section on 'Risks in pregnancy and breastfeeding'</a>.)</p><p>Because the short-term benefits of therapy may be both small and delayed in young patients, even a low rate of harmful side effects could outweigh potential benefits in such a low-risk group. If statin therapy is being contemplated for primary prevention in adults in their 20s and 30s, clinicians should carefully discuss the lack of good evidence on long-term safety prior to initiating therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Older patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As few elderly patients were enrolled in randomized trials of statins, outcomes with therapy in this age group have not been well studied. The decision to lower LDL-C in adults 75 years of age and older should be individualized and should occur after a full discussion of the potential benefits and costs. Shared decision making is important in this setting. Some lipid experts do not initiate statin therapy in individuals older than 85 years.</p><p>We believe that the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke will be significantly lowered by statin therapy in elderly patients. The higher the risk of a CVD event, the more inclined we are to recommend statin therapy in the elderly. </p><p>Since the rate of death from other all causes increases with aging, it is difficult to demonstrate a benefit from statin therapy on mortality. The overall benefit from statin therapy in individuals with significant noncardiovascular disease that it may shorten lifespan within the next 10 years is likely small.</p><p>Patients should consider the financial cost of statin therapy as well as the potential burdens of requiring multiple medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1755241916\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL DRUG THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several randomized trials have examined the effects of lipid-lowering pharmacologic therapy on cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Most trials have compared a fixed dose of a single pharmacologic agent with placebo, with both groups receiving basic, limited lifestyle counseling. No trials that have evaluated effects on CVD events have tested any medication in combination with statins or treatment to specific LDL-C goals. </p><p>As discussed below, when a pharmacologic agent is indicated for treatment in primary prevention, a statin is the preferred medication. If a statin is not tolerated or a particular LDL-C goal is not achieved on a statin alone, we suggest <strong>not</strong> administering or adding a non-statin lipid-lowering medication in most patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3469843129\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonstatin therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In early trials of lipid lowering therapy in primary prevention with medications other than statins, several trials found a disturbing increase in noncardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2629267076\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for LDL-C lowering in primary prevention'</a> above.) In primary prevention, where the absolute benefit of any therapy may be quite small, well-designed trials demonstrating greater benefit than harm are generally needed before a non-statin agent can be recommended. </p><p>Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have not been adequately evaluated in primary prevention in patients without familial hypercholesterolemia.

No trials have directly compared the effects of low-to-moderate- with high-intensity statin therapy for primary prevention. </p><p>When the decision is made to treat, we suggest starting treatment with a moderate dose of a statin, such as 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> (or 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lovastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lovastatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pravastatin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a>, or 5 to 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a>). Long-term compliance is likely increased if the patient does not have a side effect on first use of the drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects and intolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Statin side effects and intolerance, which vary somewhat among the statins, are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statins-actions-side-effects-and-administration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statins: Actions, side effects, and administration&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1476717454\"><span class=\"h1\">GOAL SETTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom a decision is made to lower LDL-C with drug therapy, the optimal target LDL-C is not well studied. Most trials have evaluated a single dosage level of statin therapy or a limited strategy of titration rather than treatment to a given LDL goal level. In addition, the two other drug therapies that might be considered for additional LDL-C lowering, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) antibodies, have not been well studied in patients without cardiovascular disease (CVD; excluding individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia).</p><p>Given these considerations, we do not think that it is necessary to set a specific LDL-C goal for these patients. We attempt to treat them with moderate-intensity statin therapy. For patients at high risk, we increase to high-intensity statin therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1364940053\" class=\"local\">'Intensity'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Failure to achieve goal LDL-C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not suggest targeting a goal LDL-C level when treating with a statin for primary prevention. (See <a href=\"#H1476717454\" class=\"local\">'Goal setting'</a> above.) Thus, in patients who do not achieve a particular LDL-C goal on statin therapy alone, we suggest <strong>not</strong> adding a non-statin lipid-lowering medication for primary prevention. That is, the patient should be maintained on statin therapy as <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> only lipid-lowering medication. Until there is better long-term evidence of the safety of PCSK9 inhibitors, we would not add these agents on to statin therapy in primary prevention.</p><p>Some patients do not achieve appropriate LDL-C reduction due to non-adherence. It is important to ask about adherence at follow-up visits. Measuring LDL-C response may be helpful in determining whether patients are adherent to treatment. When determining adherence is desired, LDL-C can reasonably be measured six weeks after initiating statin therapy and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or as the clinical situation dictates. </p><p>The LDL-C does not require fasting in most cases. However, in patients who have had prior significant elevation(s) of nonfasting triglyceride, a fasting LDL-C (calculated from the lipid profile) should be obtained. This will help to avoid miscalculation of the LDL-C. An alternative approach is to obtain a direct measurement of LDL-C. This approach can be chosen as long as the direct method is always used to assess LDL-C; switching between the calculated and direct measurements is not recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins#H2151542276\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of blood lipids and lipoproteins&quot;, section on 'Fasting versus non-fasting tests'</a>.) </p><p>In patients who do not tolerate statins, we suggest <strong>not</strong> administering a non-statin lipid-lowering medication for primary prevention, unless the patient has LDL-C levels substantially higher than 190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. That is, no lipid-lowering therapy should be administered in patients who are intolerant of statins unless their LDL-C is very high. Potential interventions include lifestyle modification and, in higher-risk patients, antiplatelet therapy.
