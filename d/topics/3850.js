Diagnosis is usually made in childhood, although diagnostic delays and variable disease manifestations are common and some individuals may not be diagnosed with FA until adulthood.</p><p>Determining whether FA is the cause of bone marrow failure has important implications for management because individuals with FA require increased surveillance for hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies and other organ dysfunction, and dramatically reduced doses of chemotherapy for treating malignancies and in the preparative regimen for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Additionally, the presence of FA must be confirmed or excluded when evaluating siblings as HCT donors, so that the patient does not receive hematopoietic stem cells from a sibling with FA.</p><p>This topic review discusses the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of FA.

This defect in DNA repair results in genomic instability, which in turn leads to increased sensitivity to cytotoxic therapies and a predisposition to certain malignancies. This defect also causes loss of hematopoietic stem cells by a poorly understood mechanism, which in turn can result in bone marrow failure. (See <a href=\"#H4145134549\" class=\"local\">'Genomic instability'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3549934086\" class=\"local\">'Etiology of bone marrow failure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H846978367\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FA is caused by mutations in one of at least 17 different FA genes (<em>FANCA to FANCQ</em>), although pathogenicity of mutations in <em>FANCM</em> has been called into question [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Additional genetic subtypes may be added, including those affecting RAD51 (<em>FANCR</em>), BRCA1 (<em>FANCS</em>), UBE2T (<em>FANCT)</em>,<em> </em>XRCC2 (<em>FANCU</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>].</p><p>In most cases, FA is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner through homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations affecting an individual FA gene. For the majority of FA genes, loss of normal function at both alleles of the gene is required to manifest disease. Two exceptions are the rare FA subtypes associated with mutation in <em>FANCB</em>, which is<em> </em>X-linked recessive, and <em>FANCR </em>(<em>RAD51)</em>, which is autosomal dominant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Heterozygotes for mutations in FA genes other than <em>FANCB </em>and <em>FANCR</em> are considered to be unaffected carriers, although some of these individuals may have an increased susceptibility to cancer.

However, the presence of congenital malformations in one sibling does not necessarily mean that all affected siblings will have similar congenital malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Complementation group testing is primarily reserved for clinical scenarios in which chromosomal stress testing is abnormal and either a mutation in known FA genes is not identified or previously undescribed variant(s) are identified and pathogenicity of the variant needs to be determined.

ICLs interfere with normal DNA replication and transcription by preventing strand separation, stalling replication forks, and compromising DNA integrity. ICLs form following exposure to radiation and DNA alkylating agents used as cancer chemotherapy, and from interactions with endogenous aldehydes formed as products of lipid peroxidation or exogenously derived aldehydes formed following alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-fanconi-anemia#H1144473403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of Fanconi anemia&quot;, section on 'Solid tumors'</a>.)</p><p>The formation of ICLs leads to assembly of a multicomponent complex at the site of the ICL called the FA core complex. This complex contains eight of the known FA proteins: FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM. Within this complex, FANCL acts as the catalytic component, functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The core complex interacts with FANCT (UBE2T) to monoubiquitinate (add a single ubiquitin chain to) the heterodimeric complex of FANCD2 and FANCI. This monoubiquitinated <span class=\"nowrap\">FANCD2/FANCI</span> complex, known as the ID complex, is then incorporated into nuclear foci, where it recruits an endonuclease complex that includes FANCP and FANCQ, which unhooks the aberrant crosslink and creates a DNA double strand break (DSB). Downstream FA proteins encoded by <em>FANCD1</em> (identical to <em>BRCA2</em>, the breast cancer susceptibility gene), <em>FANCN</em>, <em>FANCJ</em>, and <em>FANCO </em>then work via the well-described DSB DNA repair pathway to restore DNA integrity via nucleotide excision repair and through homologous recombination during the S or G2 phases of the cell cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/2,7,39,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,39,41,42</a>].</p><p>In addition to their role in repair of ICLs, increasing evidence suggests that FA proteins participate in other stress response pathways, especially those involving oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/22,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,43</a>]. In addition, FA proteins also interact with other DNA damage response pathways including proteins encoded by the ataxia-telangiectasia genes (<em>ATM</em> and <em>ATR</em>) and the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) protein nibrin, encoded by the <em>NBN</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/2,14,44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14,44-47</a>].</p><p>In patients with FA, loss of FA gene function leads to disruption of this normal repair process, genomic instability, aberrant cell cycle regulation, and cell death. These cellular effects occur both during development, leading to congenital anomalies, as well as during childhood and into adulthood, leading to increased risk of bone marrow failure, organ susceptibility to toxic exposures, and cancer. (See <a href=\"#H3290687756\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3549934086\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology of bone marrow failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term bone marrow failure refers to a deficiency or impairment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), resulting in bone marrow aplasia and peripheral pancytopenia. Bone marrow failure in FA is thought to occur due to premature, selective attrition of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs, which can be identified even prior to the onset of cytopenias. Many factors have been shown to result in premature HSC loss in individuals with FA, including defective DNA repair leading to increased DNA damage and cell cycle arrest; increased levels of reactive oxygen species and circulating inflammatory cytokines; and excessive damage caused by reactive aldehydes in the absence of intact FA repair pathways, although the exact mechanism of stem cell loss remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>].</p><p>The inability to repair DNA damage within HSCs was initially thought to be the major mechanism responsible for HSC attrition. However, subsequent evidence has suggested that in FA the bone marrow microenvironment, which is disrupted because of dysregulated oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine exposure, may contribute to bone marrow failure via chronic stress-induced HSC activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In particular, endogenous aldehydes may affect HSCs during development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Evidence to support this theory comes from a series of 64 Japanese patients with FA, in which those who were deficient in acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 had accelerated progression of bone marrow failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Other mechanisms contributing to stem cell attrition have been demonstrated in vitro and in animal models, including an increase in the level of inflammatory cytokines, reduced redox signaling, a diminished heat shock protein response, and abnormal telomere shortening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/54-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3359991449\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FA is rare overall, but it is one of the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. The incidence is approximately 1 in 100,000 to 250,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>FA has been described in nearly all races and ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Ethnic groups with a higher-than-average prevalence of FA include Ashkenazi Jews, Spanish Gypsies, and Black and Afrikaner populations from South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/26,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,65</a>].

Other <span class=\"nowrap\">populations/countries</span> in which founder mutations have been identified include Tunisia, Japan, Korea, and Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/28,33,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,33,66</a>].</p><p>FA is also relatively more prevalent in parts of the world such as specific regions in the Middle East where tribal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> local customs with respect to marriage make consanguinity, and thus likelihood of inheriting an autosomal recessive disease, more common. In one series, 30 percent of families had two affected children, and consanguinity was noted in 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The first description of FA was by Guido Fanconi in 1927, in which he described a family with three boys with birth defects and anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Historically, the heterozygote frequency for pathogenic FA mutations has been estimated to be 1:300 in the United States and Europe and 1:100 in Ashkenazi Jews and South African Afrikaners. A 2011 study using demographic data from the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund estimated a higher carrier frequency in the United States (within the range of 1:156 to 1:209) and in Israel (within the range of 1:66 to 1:128) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3290687756\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2260946219\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital malformations are the most common presenting features of FA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71159\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71159 \">table 1</a>).

A 2016 study in which a panel of experts in FA examined 54 patients with FA from the NIH inherited bone marrow failure registry (including examinations and imaging studies) found that 18 (33 percent) met criteria for VACTERL-H, a much higher proportion than the 5 percent suggested by earlier studies involving literature reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

Bone marrow failure eventually occurs in the majority of patients, though the time to onset can be quite variable. Progression to pancytopenia may occur rapidly after initial cytopenias are noted or may take months or years to develop, or (rarely) may not develop at all.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytopenias</strong> &ndash; Cytopenias may only be mild upon presentation or may develop later in the disease course if the FA diagnosis is made based on congenital anomalies. In some cases only a single cell line will be involved (typically thrombocytopenia), particularly early in life. Mild to moderate thrombocytopenia may be misdiagnosed as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The anemia is typically macrocytic, and some individuals may have macrocytosis without anemia. The degree of cytopenia may be used to characterize the degree of bone marrow failure as mild, moderate, or severe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57755 \">table 2</a>). Most patients eventually develop symptomatic anemia, although contrary to the name Fanconi &quot;anemia,&quot; symptomatic anemia is often the last severe cytopenia to develop. Severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt; <span class=\"nowrap\">500/microL)</span> and thrombocytopenia (platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;30,000/microL)</span> are often more problematic, as they can lead to potentially life-threatening infections and bleeding. Definitions of disease severity based on the bone marrow cellularity and blood counts is discussed in more detail separately.

In the small percentage of patients in whom bone marrow failure does not develop, specific genetic factors may protect from bone marrow aplasia. Patients with biallelic <em><span class=\"nowrap\">FANCD2/BRCA2</em></span> mutations appear less likely to develop bone marrow failure, though the high rate and early onset of malignancies, coupled with the short lifespan in this population may contribute to this perceived effect. In addition, up to 25 percent of patients with FA may develop acquired somatic mosaicism through gene conversion events (in compound heterozygous patients), back mutation, or even compensatory <span class=\"nowrap\">deletions/insertions,</span> which lead to correction of the chromosomal breakage sensitivity phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/81-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-84</a>]. While many patients may have somatic mosaicism detectable only in lymphocytes, patients with mosaicism in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or progenitor cells have been shown to have an ameliorated bone marrow phenotype. However, these individuals remain at risk for hematologic malignancy and other non-hematologic complications.</p><p/><p>Findings on bone marrow examination may be indistinguishable from findings seen in other causes of bone marrow failure such as aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). For patients diagnosed with FA in infancy due to congenital anomalies, screening bone marrow biopsies are often normocellular. By the onset of cytopenias, the marrow may reveal severe hypocellularity out of proportion to the degree of cytopenias. Erythroid dysplasia, including hyperplastic erythroblast islands and megaloblastic features, is commonly seen in many, but not all, bone marrow aspirates from patients with FA, and should not be interpreted in isolation as MDS in the absence of other dysplastic features, increased blasts, or cytogenetic changes. On the other hand, dysplasia in the myeloid series, increased myeloblasts, and with somewhat less specificity dysmegakaryopoiesis, should be considered to be concerning evidence for onset of clonal abnormalities consistent with MDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/22,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2526660423\"><span class=\"h2\">MDS/Leukemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MDS and leukemia are common in patients with FA; in many cases, MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the presenting finding. Patients with FA have been estimated to have a 6000-fold and 700-fold greater risk than the general population for developing MDS and AML, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. By age 50, up to 40 percent of patients with FA will develop MDS and up to 15 percent will develop AML. Lymphoid malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Burkitt lymphoma are also seen, although they are much less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Most develop AML, although some may develop T cell ALL. Patients with mutations in <em>BRCA2 </em>involving the IVS7 site have particularly early risk of leukemia, with most developing AML by three years of age.</p><p>Karyotypic abnormalities are common in patients with FA who develop MDS or AML, including translocations of chromosome 1p, monosomy 7, and gains of chromosome 3q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In one study of 53 patients, 18 had 3q amplification, which was associated with shorter survival and increased risk for development of AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. A 2012 literature review identified 46 cases of AML in patients with FA in whom cytogenetics were available and found the most common cytogenetic abnormalities to be chromosomal gains of 1q, 3q, or 13q, along with loss of chromosome 7 (or more specifically, 7q) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. In contrast, cytogenetic lesions common in de novo AML including t(8;21), trisomy 8, and inv(16) were not seen in any of the patients with FA.</p><p>Cytogenetic clones should be interpreted within the context of the bone marrow morphology. Some cytogenetic clones of unclear clinical significance may remain stable or become undetectable over time, whereas loss of part or all of chromosome 7 necessitates consideration of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) prior to leukemia progression. With any cytogenetic abnormality, close monitoring of the bone marrow and the blood counts is warranted.

As an example, a 2003 study involving a cohort of 1300 individuals with FA estimated the median age of cancer development to be approximately 16 years, compared with 68 years in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In many late-onset cases of FA, malignancy is the presenting finding.</p><p>The cumulative incidence of solid tumors is increasing as individuals with FA are living longer, due to cure of bone marrow failure by HCT. In addition, HCT may increase the risk of solid tumors in some individuals with FA, likely due to a combination of factors including exposure to DNA damaging agents or radiation in the conditioning regimen and the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This trend was demonstrated in a study that compared the rates of cancer between 117 individuals with FA who underwent HCT with 145 who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The age-specific hazard of squamous cell cancer was 4.4-fold higher in individuals who had a transplant, and the tumors occurred at a younger age (median age, 18 versus 33 years).

This study followed 754 patients for over 20 years and identified 79 solid tumors. The most common were squamous cell cancers (SCCs) of the head, neck, esophagus, anus, and urogenital region; these accounted for 39 of the solid tumors (49 percent). There were also 18 liver tumors, accounting for 23 percent of tumors; as well as six renal tumors, five brain tumors, three breast cancers, and other tumor types including germ cell tumors and sarcomas. Similar findings have been reported in other cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>].</p><p>Despite this high incidence of malignancy, solid tumors are rare in childhood, with the exception of those harboring biallelic <em><span class=\"nowrap\">FANCD1/BRCA2</em></span> mutations, in whom the likelihood of at least one malignancy is greater than 97 percent by seven years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].

A 2003 report from a United States cohort suggested that the high incidence of SCC of the <span class=\"nowrap\">head/neck</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">anal/urogenital</span> regions in patients with FA were due to increased susceptibility to genomic instability produced by HPV, as &gt;80 percent of these tumors were HPV-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

The screening laboratory test for this defect involves assessment of chromosomal breakage upon exposure of cells to diepoxybutane (DEB) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C (MMC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/63,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,111</a>]. This testing is performed on T lymphocytes; thus, peripheral blood is preferred as a test source over bone marrow. In settings of severe leukopenia, the testing can still be performed, provided that the testing lab is able to adequately expand cells in culture. Due to the nature of this assay, the turnaround time for this testing is generally in the range of two to four weeks.</p><p>If chromosomal breakage testing of lymphocytes is negative in the setting of a high pre-test probability of FA based on characteristic physical features, we repeat the testing on skin fibroblasts. Skin fibroblast testing is also needed for patients who have already undergone HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>While chromosomal breakage testing is quite sensitive for FA, it is not entirely specific, as there are several other rare genetic conditions associated with chromosomal instability (see <a href=\"#H1060905424\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below) that can yield a positive test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. Qualitative assessments of the patterns of abnormal breakage can help distinguish FA from other chromosome instability syndromes, including rates of spontaneous breakage, increased breakage in response to both DEB and MMC (most common in FA) versus increased breakage to MMC alone (more common in other chromosomal breakage syndromes), and the presence of atypical features such as railroad figures and premature centromere separation, which is seen exclusively in the cohesinopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].</p><p>An alternative to traditional chromosomal breakage testing is cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry following DNA crosslinking agent exposure. In this test, FA cells that are unable to repair DNA damage undergo cell cycle arrest in G2, leading to a much higher percentage of cells in G2 in MMC-exposed blood cells from FA versus non-FA patients. However, because this test yields similar information as the more widely used chromosomal breakage testing and does not differentiate FA from other breakage syndromes, its use in routine testing remains limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. Immunoblotting for FANCD2 ubiquitination as a clinical test has the advantage of enabling rapid diagnosis but the disadvantage of missing patients with FA mutations downstream of FANCD2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. Thus, this test also is not routinely used.</p><p>FA gene sequencing is recommended for all patients with a positive result from chromosomal breakage testing. The reasons for this recommendation are several-fold:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of the genetic defect definitively confirms the diagnosis and eliminates other chromosomal breakage disorders as the cause of the abnormal screening test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sequencing enables screening of family members for the purposes of identifying HCT donors, performing prenatal testing, and genetic counseling, given that heterozygous carriers will not have abnormal chromosomal breakage testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fanconi-anemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sequencing enables precision medicine application of <span class=\"nowrap\">genotype/phenotype</span> correlations (see <a href=\"#H846978367\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above) to the care of individual patients (eg, cancer screening in heterozygotes for mutations with increased risk of solid tumors).</p><p/><p>When sequencing is done, in most cases the initial test should consist of single gene sequencing of <em>FANCA</em>, which is most likely to be affected, with reflex to sequencing the remaining FA-associated genes via multiplex next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel testing if the <em>FANCA</em> gene is normal. NGS panel testing is available clinically through a number of laboratories, many of which are listed on the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/&amp;token=wEsKVFvqlKzpT+qOtddW/y3+Lj0shalBW+L1ZyL4tryNPgji1PaJ6Kbd/o1hE9A6&amp;TOPIC_ID=2693\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Genetic Testing Registry website</a>. In individual circumstances however, this algorithm may be adjusted. For instance, patients from Ashkenazi Jewish backgrounds may be screened first for the founder IVS4 +4A&gt;T mutation in <em>FANCC </em>before proceeding to NGS testing, and family members of an individual with a known mutation should be tested for that mutation.</p><p>As discussed above (see <a href=\"#H846978367\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above), complementation group testing, once a standard part of the assessment and subtype assignment for patients with FA, has largely been replaced by sequencing for most patients. However, complementation group testing may still be used to define the functional subtype of FA in situations where either no variants in FA genes are identified by NGS, or several variants in distinct FA genes are identified.

Like FA, patients with aAA often present between 5 to 15 years of age with multilineage cytopenias and bone marrow aplasia, and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an effective curative modality. Unlike FA, individuals with aAA have normal chromosomal breakage testing; absence of pathogenic mutations in FA genes; lack of congenital anomalies and endocrine features characteristic of FA; typically a more rapid onset and progression of cytopenias; and a response to immunosuppressive therapy.

Like FA, PNH is associated with bone marrow failure. Unlike FA, individuals with PNH have chronic intra- and extravascular hemolytic anemia and a high risk of thrombosis, and they do not have abnormal chromosomal breakage testing or FA-associated congenital anomalies. The presence of a PNH clone, regardless of size, is increasingly used as evidence that bone marrow failure is due to acquired autoimmunity rather than an inherited condition such as FA.

Unlike FA, patients with DC will have very short telomeres on telomere length analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Reticular dysgenesis (RD) is a type of severe combined immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the <em>AK2 </em>gene that may also be associated with bone marrow aplasia. However, unlike FA, patients with RD develop bone marrow aplasia in infancy associated with sensorineural hearing loss and severe adaptive immune dysfunction. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT), and Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) also may be associated with trilineage aplasia in the bone marrow, but typically this develops after an extended period of isolated neutropenia (SDS), thrombocytopenia (CAMT), or anemia (DBA). DBA in particular is often difficult to distinguish on clinical features from FA due to the overlap in VACTERL-H association in both DBA and FA.

Like FA, these conditions typically present in childhood with bone marrow failure. Unlike FA, patients with these causes of pancytopenia lack congenital anomalies and in most cases pancytopenia is transient and reversible, although in rare cases, bone marrow aplasia caused by drugs can be permanent.

Also compared to FA, these conditions show subtle differences in the associated congenital anomalies, the spectrum of associated malignancies, and the specific abnormalities seen within chromosomal breakage testing (eg, increased chromosome 7 and 14 abnormalities in NBS, railroading figures in cohesinopathies). However, in particularly difficult cases, genomic sequencing studies are especially helpful in distinguishing FA from NBS and other rare chromosomal breakage syndromes.

Unlike FA or FA with secondary MDS, de novo MDS is not associated with congenital anomalies, an abnormal chromosome breakage test, or FA mutations. Importantly, individuals with MDS in whom FA is being considered should have chromosomal breakage tests performed on skin fibroblasts rather than hematopoietic cells, because bone marrow cytogenetic abnormalities associated with MDS clones may skew chromosomal breakage results performed on lymphocytes.

A large number of genes are involved; the most commonly mutated are <em>FANCA</em>, <em>FANCC</em>, and<em> FANCG</em>.
