Patients commonly experience pain, paresthesia, and less commonly, weakness in the median nerve distribution. CTS is the most frequent compressive focal mononeuropathy seen in clinical practice.</p><p>This topic will review the etiology of CTS. Other clinical aspects of CTS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The carpal tunnel is formed by the transverse carpal ligament (flexor retinaculum) superiorly with the carpal bones inferiorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59856\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59856 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The median nerve, accompanied by the nine flexor tendons of the forearm musculature, must pass through this anatomic tunnel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53265 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. When compression of the median nerve occurs, ischemia and mechanical disruption of the nerve follow.</p><p>The median nerve emerges from the brachial plexus in the upper arm with contributions from the C6, C7, C8, and T1 nerve roots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50576\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50576 \">figure 3</a>). Roots C6 and C7 supply the median sensory fibers that provide sensation to the thenar eminence and the first three and a half digits of the hand. Roots C8 and T1 supply the motor fibers to the muscles of the forearm and hand that are innervated by the median nerve. Thus, nerve fibers that are destined to comprise the median nerve exit the spine at these nerve roots to travel in the upper, middle, and lower trunks of the brachial plexus. These fibers will then pass through the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus and combine to form the median nerve.</p><p>The median nerve has no branches in the upper arm. As the median nerve passes through the antecubital fossa region, it lies adjacent to the brachial artery on the medial side before passing more deeply within the forearm.</p><p>In the upper portion of the forearm, the median nerve innervates four muscles (the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and the flexor digitorum superficialis). The median nerve then gives off a peripheral nerve branch that forms the anterior interosseous nerve, which innervates the pronator quadratus muscle just proximal to the wrist. The anterior interosseous nerve also innervates the flexor pollicis longus muscle and medial heads of the flexor digitorum profundus I and II muscles.</p><p>The median nerve proper runs parallel to the anterior interosseous nerve in the forearm. In the region proximal to the wrist, the palmar cutaneous sensory branch of the median nerve comes off to provide sensation to the lateral half of the palm. Because the palmer branch of the median nerve passes over, rather than through, the carpal tunnel, sensation change (pain or numbness) involving the thenar eminence is typically not observed in CTS. The pattern of sensory innervation of the median nerve is demonstrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70720\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70720 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>As the median nerve crosses the wrist, it passes through the carpal tunnel along with nine flexor muscle tendons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59856\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59856 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53265 \">figure 2</a>). Inflammation and compression of the median nerve most commonly occurs within the carpal tunnel. Rarely, median entrapment can also occur more proximally in the region of the elbow or just distal to the elbow.</p><p>Upon exiting the carpal tunnel, the median nerve provides motor and sensory innervation to the hand. The muscles of the hand that are innervated by the median nerve are the abductor pollicis brevis, the flexor pollicis brevis (superficial head), the opponens pollicis, and the first and second lumbricals. Although these muscles can be affected in patients with severe or long-standing CTS, the lumbrical is sometimes spared.</p><p>There are occasionally anomalous innervations in the hand that can make the diagnosis more challenging; however, the above described anatomy is the most common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of CTS is multifactorial. Increased pressure in the intracarpal canal plays a key role in the development of clinical CTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>While the precise etiology of increased carpal tunnel pressure in CTS is uncertain, experimental evidence suggests that anatomic compression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammation are possible mechanisms. Increased pressure in the carpal tunnel can injure the nerve directly, impair axonal transport, or compress vessels in the perineurium and cause median nerve ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Nine flexor tendons, any of which can become inflamed or thickened, pass through the carpal tunnel alongside the median nerve. Anatomic compression may result from a noninflammatory fibrosis affecting the subsynovial connective tissue that surrounds the flexor tendons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other possible causes of compression include congenitally small anatomic space, mass lesions (such as a cyst, neoplasm, or persistent median artery) and edema or inflammatory conditions that result from systemic illness such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Upper extremity posture also influences carpal tunnel pressure. The lowest carpal tunnel pressure is seen when the wrist is in a neutral or slightly flexed position, and it increases proportionately with deviation from this posture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/2,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-9</a>].</p><p>Pathologic analysis of human nerve compression has revealed edema and thickening of vessel walls within the endoneurium and perineurium, noninflammatory synovial fibrosis and vascular proliferation, fibrosis, myelin thinning, and nerve fiber degeneration and regeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/2,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,11</a>]. These factors may account for surgical reports of an &quot;hour glass&quot; shaped deformity of the median nerve in the region of the carpal tunnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This deformity may reflect relative thinning of the nerve beneath the transverse carpal tunnel ligament and swelling of the nerve in more distal and proximal segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>There is some evidence that vascular proliferation and fibrosis are associated with increased expression of prostaglandin E2 and vascular endothelial growth factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the precise role of these factors in CTS is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common disorder among adults. The estimated annual incidence of CTS per 100,000 population ranges from 324 to 542 for women, and 125 to 303 for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Among children, CTS is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], though its incidence is unknown. Depending on its definition, the estimated prevalence of CTS in the general population is 1 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

A 2003 systematic review of CTS found evidence supporting an association for three disorders: diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.1), hypothyroidism (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1-2), and rheumatoid arthritis (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

These findings are due to soft tissue enlargement (synovial edema and tendon hyperplasia).

However, this may be a reflection of inherited anatomic variability in the size of the carpal tunnel, familial predisposition to other medical conditions (ie, diabetes), or some undefined predisposing factor.</p><p>Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is a recurrent, episodic demyelinating neuropathy. Affected patients typically present with isolated nerve palsies. The most frequently affected nerves are those at common sites of trauma or entrapment and include the axillary, median, radial, ulnar, peroneal, or brachial plexus nerves. Single nerve palsies typically appear sequentially, resolving in days to months.
