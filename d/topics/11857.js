This recommendation is based upon the rationale that OHS will progress if not treated with PAP and improvement is dependent upon optimal compliance with therapy. Mode selection for initial PAP therapy is determined by the presence or absence of comorbid obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) based on the results of in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome&quot;, section on 'Identify coexistent sleep disordered breathing'</a>.):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 90 percent of patients with OHS have coexisting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in which case continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the initial mode of choice.

Patients with OHS and OSA who fail or do not tolerate CPAP are also treated with BPAP. For those who fail or do not tolerate BPAP, a hybrid mode (average volume-assured pressure support) or, less commonly, volume-cycled ventilation may be chosen. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Bilevel positive airway pressure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H521132620\" class=\"local\">'Volume-cycled ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>During sleep, noninvasive PAP therapy is typically administered via nasal mask, full face mask (covering the nose and mouth), nasal pillows, or hybrid mask (oral mask with nasal pillows). Although noninvasive PAP can be delivered via mouthpiece, this is impractical for use during sleep and is only feasible for treating awake hypoventilation. Helmet interfaces are also available, but there is limited information on their use in treating patients with OHS, and therefore they cannot be recommended. While PAP is mostly administered during sleep, similar principles apply when PAP is administered during wakefulness when patients present with acute decompensation of OHS. Detailed information on interfaces and devices are discussed separately.

Typically, titration is performed in a laboratory setting with polysomnographic monitoring. Auto-adjusting CPAP should not be used, as the limited information available on its use suggests that it improves hypercapnia in only half of in patients with OHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Since CPAP does not directly augment ventilation other than by maintaining upper airway patency, the CPAP-related improvement of hypercapnia during both wakefulness and sleep may be due to relief of respiratory muscle fatigue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> augmentation of central ventilatory drive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similarly, CPAP may not universally eliminate nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation, which is a signal of persistent nocturnal hypoventilation.

However, patients who benefit from nocturnal CPAP therapy tend to have a higher baseline apnea hypopnea index (AHI), less restrictive physiology on spirometry, and less severe oxyhemoglobin desaturation during baseline polysomnography than patients who do not improve with CPAP.

As an example, tidal volume is greater using an IPAP of 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and an EPAP of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (difference or &quot;delta&quot; of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), than an IPAP of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and an EPAP of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (difference or &quot;delta&quot; of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O).

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should <strong>not</strong> be used in this setting. In cases where the diagnosis of OHS is presumed and the patient has not received PAP therapy in the chronic setting, these modes are used until the patient is sufficiently stable to undergo polysomnography with formal titration of PAP settings. In those already receiving CPAP, switching to BPAP is appropriate and in those already on BPAP, inspiratory PAP (IPAP) may be cautiously increased above its chronic setting with most patients eventually able to return to long-term CPAP or BPAP therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>BPAP was the mode of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) used in most studies demonstrating consistent and significant decreases in the partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and increases in pH (ie, indices of improved ventilation) during hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/18,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,38,39</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3503524759\"><span class=\"h2\">Bilevel positive airway ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) is the mode that is generally tried first in this setting. Most studies utilize increasing levels of pressure as tolerated by awake patients with no universal strategy for determining the initial BPAP settings in either the awake or sleeping patient with acutely decompensated OHS. We suggest the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If PAP na&iuml;ve, we typically begin with inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) settings of 4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and then increase the IPAP every several minutes in increments of 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O until the patient appears more comfortable and there is an acceptable respiratory rate (eg, &lt;30 breaths per minute), oxyhemoglobin saturation (eg, &ge;90 percent), heart rate (eg, &le;100 beats per minute), and degree of ventilation (eg, pH &gt;7.30 on serial arterial blood gases 1 to 2 hours later). The inspired oxygen concentration should be titrated to maintain adequate oxyhemoglobin saturation (eg, &ge;90 percent). Failure of oxygenation to improve quickly may require further increases in EPAP. IPAP is generally increased simultaneously in order to maintain a pressure difference between EPAP and IPAP that is sufficient to decrease work of breathing and adequately ventilate the patient. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those chronically on CPAP, a similar approach can be used, beginning with the baseline CPAP settings as the initial EPAP and IPAP settings and then adjust them rapidly as above. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those chronically on BPAP, the IPAP may be increased similarly to that described for a PAP na&iuml;ve patient. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H521132620\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume-cycled ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume-cycled positive pressure ventilation (VCPPV) is reserved for situations when sufficient alveolar ventilation cannot be achieved with BPAP. VCPPV delivers a set tidal volume. VCPPV ensures adequate ventilation by generating pressures high enough to overcome the physiologic limitations (upper airway obstruction and reduced respiratory compliance) presented by the patient with OHS. This mode may be tried when BPAP fails in a patient with acute decompensation of OHS. Short-term VCPPV during sleep has been reported to improve daytime hypercapnia, with many patients eventually able to return to long-term CPAP or BPAP therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/19,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,37</a>]. </p><p>For VCPPV, the ventilator mode, respiratory rate, tidal volume, inspired oxygen concentration, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) must be selected (similarly to invasive mechanical ventilator settings). An assist-control mode is typically used to fully augment spontaneous respiratory efforts (ie, the patient receives an assisted breath with each spontaneous breath). The largest tidal volume that consistently maintains an airway pressure less than 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is generally chosen (generally 7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/Kg</span> of ideal body weight), and the respiratory rate is then set to achieve a minute ventilation of 6 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>. The respiratory rate or tidal volume can be adjusted as needed to achieve the acute ventilatory goals (eg, pH &gt;7.30 on serial arterial blood gases). The inspired oxygen concentration should be titrated to maintain adequate oxyhemoglobin saturation (eg, &ge;90 percent). If the patient is PAP na&iuml;ve or their prior CPAP or BPAP settings are unknown, a starting PEEP of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O pressure is recommended with careful clinical monitoring in order to detect patient inspiratory efforts not sensed by the ventilator that would require further increases in PEEP to overcome upper airway occlusion. Should the home CPAP or EPAP settings be known, PEEP should be adjusted with this information taken into consideration. &#160; </p><p>High interface pressures may cause sleep fragmentation, discomfort, intolerance, or an interface leak when VCPPV begins. In this situation, reducing the tidal volume and raising the respiratory rate will decrease the interface pressure while maintaining the desired minute ventilation. However, these features make this mode of ventilation unsuitable for chronic use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2379264599\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive mechanical ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are not candidates for noninvasive ventilation or who fail this therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60442\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60442 \">table 3</a>) should be considered for urgent endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation. Indications for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation are similar to those in the general population, although intubation may be challenging due to body habitus.

Supplemental oxygen should only be administered when positive pressure therapy alone is insufficient to eliminate hypoxemia. Supplemental oxygen during sleep is titrated during polysomnography to eliminate hypoxemia or severe oxyhemoglobin desaturation after the optimal settings of positive pressure therapy have been established. Supplemental oxygen while awake can be titrated using oximetry at rest and with exertion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term supplemental oxygen therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Supplemental oxygen is typically added to the respiratory circuit via a specific device connector, either a port located in the mask or to an adaptor positioned in the tubing close to the mask. It should be titrated to the lowest flow that maintains a oxyhemoglobin saturation of &gt;90 percent. Occasionally for intractable hypoxemia, a nasal cannula can be placed underneath the mask.</p><p>If the pressure settings are subsequently changed, the flow of supplemental oxygen may need to be adjusted since the change may eliminate the need for supplementation. In addition, pressure changes generate varying degrees of air flow through the tubing and exhalation ports that may cause a dilutional effect on the oxygen added to the circuit. Periodic repeat awake and nocturnal evaluations are also necessary after the initial titration to ensure that ongoing supplemental oxygen therapy continues to be necessary and that the prescription is correct. The need for supplemental oxygen frequently decreases as the patient's cardiopulmonary status improves with nocturnal positive pressure therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/15,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18,19</a>]. After one to three months of stabilization on PAP, if an awake ABG verifies resolution of hypercapnia and a concomitant improvement of awake oxygenation without the need for daytime oxygen supplementation, nocturnal oxygen testing while on PAP with either a reduced flow of or no supplemental oxygen should be performed. &#160;</p><p>Supplemental oxygen <strong>alone </strong>(without positive pressure therapy) is <strong>inadequate</strong> therapy for OHS. Although it may improve nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation, it does not relieve upper airway obstruction or augment ventilation, and it may acutely worsen carbon dioxide retention even in stable patients with OHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

This recommendation is based upon the rationale that OHS will progress if not treated with PAP and improvement is dependent upon optimal compliance with therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a mode of noninvasive positive pressure therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with OHS who have coexisting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is approximately 90 percent of OHS patients, we suggest continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) rather than bilevel PAP (BPAP) as the first line of treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2650159132\" class=\"local\">'Obesity hypoventilation and obstructive sleep apnea'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Continuous positive airway pressure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A few weeks after PAP therapy is initiated (eg, within the first month), patients should be monitored for adherence and for symptoms and signs of persistent sleep-related hypercapnia. Periodic awake arterial blood gases (ABGs; eg, first one to three months) should be drawn to assess for residual alveolar hypoventilation. Repeat polysomnography should be performed when features of alveolar hypoventilation persist or when factors contributing to the severity of OHS (eg, body mass, hypothyroidism, heavy ethanol consumption, or sedative use) have changed. Repeat polysomnography performed by some experts when awake ABGs suggest improved alveolar ventilation and a reduction or change in PAP therapy is feasible, although this approach is not validated. (See <a href=\"#H2377266325\" class=\"local\">'Assessing treatment response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with OHS and OSA who fail or do not tolerate CPAP and for patients with OHS and sleep-related hypoventilation (ie, no obstructive events during sleep), we suggest BPAP rather than CPAP (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For those who fail BPAP, hybrid modes (average volume-assured pressure support) or, less commonly, volume-cycled modes may be chosen. (See <a href=\"#H839742030\" class=\"local\">'Second line therapies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H43568544\" class=\"local\">'Obesity hypoventialtion and sleep-related hypoventilation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2901621994\" class=\"local\">'Other noninvasive ventilation modes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with acutely decompensated OHS, BPAP is usually the initial mode of choice provided there are no contraindications and there is no indication for immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation.
