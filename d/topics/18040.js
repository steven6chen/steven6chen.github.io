This topic will discuss the intrapartum management of TOLAC. Choosing the mode of delivery after a previous cesarean is reviewed separately.

The frequency of uterine rupture or dehiscence significantly increased over time: from 0.7 percent at &lt;1 hour to about 1.5 percent at 1 to &lt;3 hours, to 3 percent at &ge;3 hours. In contrast to other studies, the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes did not differ significantly by second-stage length. </p><p>These data are subject to the limitations of observational studies but suggest that decision-making regarding management of the second stage does not need to be modified in women undergoing TOLAC.

The following data should be considered in shared decision-making regarding induction versus planned repeat cesarean delivery when prelabor delivery is indicated.</p><p>The benefits and harms of planned repeat cesarean delivery versus induction of labor have not been evaluated by randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-delivery-intrapartum-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In at least two retrospective cohort studies, when women undergoing TOLAC induction were compared with those managed expectantly (the appropriate control group as opposed to women in spontaneous labor), induction actually reduced the odds of cesarean delivery at term, but was associated with a higher risk of uterine rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-delivery-intrapartum-management/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In one of these studies, the absolute rates of these outcomes with induction at 39 weeks versus expectant management were VBAC 74 versus 61 percent (odds ratio [OR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.67) and uterine rupture 1.4 versus 0.5 percent (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.22-6.12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-delivery-intrapartum-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>While there is no conclusive evidence that induction of women with a prior cesarean delivery increases the risk of uterine rupture, these and other epidemiologic studies suggest that this may be the case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-delivery-intrapartum-management/abstract/1,19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19-24</a>]. However, factors that attenuate the risk of rupture in these women should also be considered. Women with a prior vaginal delivery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a favorable cervix do not appear to be at increased risk of uterine rupture with induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-delivery-intrapartum-management/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

ACOG supports use of oxytocin for augmentation of labor in women with a previous cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-delivery-intrapartum-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Data regarding the risk of uterine rupture from oxytocin augmentation of labor during TOLAC are conflicting. Three large observational studies reported an increased risk for uterine rupture with labor augmentation (OR 2.3 to 14, actual rate of rupture 0.9 to 1.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-delivery-intrapartum-management/abstract/1,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28,29</a>], and two others did not find an increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-delivery-intrapartum-management/abstract/2,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,30</a>]. Small numbers of uterine ruptures and use of prostaglandin analogues for cervical ripening prior to augmentation of labor prevent definitive conclusions based on these findings.</p><p>It is unclear whether oxytocin regimens should be modified or an upper dose limit should be set to reduce the risk of rupture in women undergoing TOLAC. Observational studies have suggested an association between oxytocin doses &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">milliunits/minute,</span> tachysystole, and uterine rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-delivery-intrapartum-management/abstract/17,20,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,31</a>]. The low incidence of uterine rupture limits the power of these studies to detect small differences in dose-related risk of rupture. Given the limited available evidence, ACOG has not made any recommendations for oxytocin dosing in TOLAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trial-of-labor-after-cesarean-delivery-intrapartum-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2633434451\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms of uterine rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring for evidence of uterine rupture is a critical component of intrapartum management of TOLAC. Signs and symptoms of uterine rupture may include fetal heart rate abnormalities, weakening contractions, loss of fetal station, abdominal pain, suprapubic pain at the level of the hysterotomy, need for frequent epidural dosing, vaginal bleeding, maternal hemodynamic instability, and hematuria. Clinical vigilance and careful evaluation are especially warranted in women with persistent complaints of pain despite neuraxial anesthesia or need for frequent anesthetic redosing to achieve adequate pain control.

Although not a first-line approach, amnioinfusion can be used to relieve umbilical cord compression in women undergoing TOLAC, similar to women without a scarred uterus. An examination to ensure that there are no other signs or symptoms of uterine rupture should be performed before beginning the infusion since fetal heart rate decelerations may be sign of rupture.

No data support routine intrauterine examination to identify asymptomatic uterine dehiscence after a spontaneous vaginal delivery. If there is clinical suspicion that uterine rupture occurred during the second stage of labor, then manual uterine exploration should be performed. In postpartum women, uterine rupture that occurred during delivery is characterized by pain and persistent vaginal bleeding despite use of uterotonic agents. Hematuria may occur if the rupture extends into the bladder.</p><p>However, exploration of the lower uterine segment to evaluate for uterine rupture is prudent after an operative vaginal delivery for a terminal bradycardia, even in the absence of excessive vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain. This is not necessary if operative vaginal delivery is performed for another indication.</p><p>Clinical findings and management of uterine rupture are reviewed in more detail separately.

(See <a href=\"#H812449585\" class=\"local\">'Facility resources'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upon admission for anticipated TOLAC, women should be consented for both TOLAC and repeat cesarean delivery. Informed consent for TOLAC should include a discussion of the risk of uterine rupture. (See <a href=\"#H3168426231\" class=\"local\">'Documentation of informed consent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We obtain a baseline hemoglobin or hematocrit and blood type and screen. We recommend placement of intravenous access at admission in case cesarean delivery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood product administration become necessary. (See <a href=\"#H639076132\" class=\"local\">'Admission laboratory tests'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2476411524\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous access'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation by the anesthesia team at admission is prudent in case cesarean delivery becomes necessary, as well as for reviewing options for labor analgesia. Neuraxial anesthesia has not been found to mask the symptoms of uterine rupture or decrease the likelihood of vaginal birth after cesarean. (See <a href=\"#H367646400\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform continuous monitoring of uterine activity and the fetal heart race tracing. Signs and symptoms of uterine rupture may include fetal heart rate abnormalities, weakening contractions, loss of fetal station, abdominal pain, suprapubic pain at the level of the hysterotomy, need for frequent epidural dosing, vaginal bleeding, maternal hemodynamic instability, and hematuria. Clinical vigilance and careful evaluation are especially warranted in women with persistent pain despite neuraxial anesthesia or need for frequent redosing to achieve adequate pain control. (See <a href=\"#H2692246757\" class=\"local\">'Cardiotocography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2633434451\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms of uterine rupture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available evidence suggests that labor progress is similar in women undergoing TOLAC and those with an unscarred uterus. (See <a href=\"#H3435302015\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of labor progress'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both induction and augmentation are reasonable options for women undergoing TOLAC. Clinical vigilance is warranted in these settings as some observational studies have reported an increased risk of uterine rupture with labor induction, and possibly with oxytocin augmentation. Women with a prior vaginal delivery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a favorable cervix do not appear to be at increased risk of uterine rupture with induction. (See <a href=\"#H2615925816\" class=\"local\">'Induction of labor'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1245848019\" class=\"local\">'Oxytocin augmentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transcervical catheters, oxytocin and amniotomy are reasonable options for cervical ripening and labor induction in TOLAC. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> (PGE1) and other prostaglandins should be avoided given the increased risk of uterine rupture in observational studies. (See <a href=\"#H1693570267\" class=\"local\">'Methods of cervical ripening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine uterine exploration at the time of delivery to evaluate for uterine rupture is unnecessary. If there is clinical suspicion that uterine rupture occurred during the second stage of labor (pain and persistent vaginal bleeding despite use of uterotonic agents), then manual uterine exploration should be performed. Exploration of the lower uterine segment to evaluate for uterine rupture is prudent after an operative vaginal delivery for a terminal bradycardia, even in the absence of excessive vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain.
