In severe cases, nausea and vomiting may cause weight loss, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and malnutrition due to inadequate caloric and fluid intake.</p><p>Management of gastroparesis consists of supportive measures (eg, hydration and nutrition), optimizing glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus, medications, and occasionally surgical therapy. The limited efficacy of these options for patients with severe gastroparesis has provided a rationale for the development of novel approaches for treatment.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the methods of electrical stimulation of gastric motor activity for gastroparesis and their efficacy in treating gastroparesis. The pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of gastroparesis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroparesis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-delayed-gastric-emptying\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of delayed gastric emptying&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-gastroparesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of gastroparesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MYOELECTRIC CONTROL OF GASTRIC MOTOR FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The emptying of gastric contents after a meal is controlled by specific motor and myoelectric activities of different regions of the stomach.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proximal stomach exhibits changes in tone in response to eating, which serve initially to accommodate the ingested bolus and then, as digestion progresses, to regulate delivery of food particles into the distal stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The distal stomach exhibits a fed motor pattern consisting of phasic contractions that propagate from the gastric body to the pylorus at a maximal frequency of three cycles per minute (cpm). These serve to grind and mix the food into a fine particulate suspension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>Impairment of normal phasic motor activity in the distal stomach produces the clinical condition of gastroparesis. The frequency and direction of the phasic motor activity is regulated by the gastric slow wave, a rhythmic electrical oscillation, which is believed to be generated by the interstitial cells of Cajal in the proximal gastric body, the &quot;pacemaker&quot; zone of the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The slow wave is ubiquitously present at a frequency of 3 cpm, regardless of the contractile state of the stomach. During motor quiescence, the slow wave exhibits a plateau potential of low amplitude. Phasic contractions are generated when the slow-wave plateau potential increases in amplitude or when action potentials are stimulated by meal-induced neurohumoral activators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300680411\"><span class=\"h1\">GASTRIC ELECTRICAL STIMULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal methods of gastric electrical stimulation are high-frequency gastric electrical stimulation and gastric electrical pacing. The former has limited evidence of efficacy and is available for humanitarian treatment in patients with gastroparesis that is refractory to other therapies, while the latter is at present too large for implantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300680277\"><span class=\"h2\">High-frequency gastric electrical stimulation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044925\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of action of high-frequency gastric electrical neurostimulation at 12 cycles per minute is uncertain, but probably does not relate to stimulation of gastric emptying. Little or no consistent acceleration of solid phase emptying has been observed in clinical trials of neurostimulation. In one retrospective review of 63 patients, gastric stimulation reduced gastric retention at four hours by only 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Low-energy, high-frequency neurostimulation also has no effect on basal gastric electrical activity and has no effect on dysrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, it enhances slow-wave amplitude and propagation velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Intraoperative techniques to measure high resolution gastric electrical conduction profiles have shown no effects of gastric neurostimulation on slow-wave dysrhythmias, conduction blocks, retrograde propagation, ectopic pacemakers, or colliding waveforms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The device also increases maximally tolerated volumes of gastric distention, reflecting blunting of luminal perception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Gastric neurostimulation modifies sympathovagal activity and modulates activity in thoracic spinal neurons that are responsive to gastric distention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In animal models, gastric electrical stimulation increases ghrelin-positive cells and mRNA and circulating plasma ghrelin levels, suggesting possible mechanistic participation of this neurohumoral agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H591275\"><span class=\"h3\">Benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three randomized controlled crossover studies have been published for patients with diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis. A fourth preliminary study offers more convincing evidence of benefits of gastric stimulation in this condition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first suggested that there was significant benefit with treatment on versus off in a combined group of idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis with the predominant benefit in those with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, the second controlled study in diabetic gastroparesis showed no difference between on and off treatment periods after an initial six weeks unblinded on treatment phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, following the on and off treatment periods all patients had their stimulators turned on and all had improvements in subjective and objective parameters with chronic stimulation after 12 months of gastric electrical stimulation, compared with baseline. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third controlled study in idiopathic gastroparesis patients had a similar trial design as the investigation in diabetics. Results of this trial paralleled the diabetic study, showing no significant differences in symptoms in the crossover phase regardless of whether the device was on or off [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As in the diabetic study, symptoms showed significant reductions during the unblinded study phases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In preliminary results from a multicenter randomized trial in which 149 patients with diabetic, idiopathic, or postsurgical gastroparesis were assigned to on versus off stimulation for four months with crossover to the other arm for an additional four months, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] vomiting scores were significantly lower with the device on versus off, but other symptoms were not reported. </p><p/><p>A number of small uncontrolled studies have reported clinically important benefits of gastric electrical stimulation as soon as three days after surgery, including an improvement in nausea and vomiting in patients with diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis (including symptom control in a pregnant diabetic patient with gastroparesis), and gastroparesis due to other causes (eg, malignancy-associated disease, after fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophagectomy for esophageal carcinoma, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and transplantation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/19-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-31</a>]. The response rates to gastric neurostimulation in these uncontrolled studies range from 50 to 92 percent with continued reduction in gastroparesis symptoms for up to 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/16,32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,32-35</a>]. In series that included children who underwent stimulator implantation, there have been significant reductions in severity of nausea, vomiting, and overall symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In addition to gastroparesis, an uncontrolled series observed 40 percent symptom reductions in patients with refractory cyclic vomiting syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In other reports, addition of pyloroplasty to gastric stimulator surgery promoted significantly greater acceleration of gastric emptying compared with stimulator implantation alone with greater symptom improvements in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In patients initially unresponsive to gastric electrical stimulation, implanting a second stimulator with positioning of the new electrodes to alternate locations on the gastric serosa has been associated with a reduction in symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A large series observed efficacy of gastric stimulation to improve gastroparesis manifestations in patients also receiving sacral electrical stimulation for lower gastrointestinal or bladder symptoms, suggesting the two stimuli do not interfere with one another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. To summarize, the potential role of gastric electrical stimulation is not clear, given the less convincing benefit in randomized controlled crossover trials published to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. </p><p>Observational studies have also reported an improvement in body mass index, HbA1c, serum albumin, and reduction in the need for prokinetic medication and supplemental nutrition with gastric electrical stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/20,23,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23,43,44</a>]. Gastric stimulation has also been associated with an improvement in physical and mental quality of life scores and reduction in the need for hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/20,22,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H591135\"><span class=\"h3\">Risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of high-frequency gastric electrical stimulation include infection, lead dislodgement, and bowel obstruction. Reasons for device explantation in one large series included nonresponse to therapy (4 percent), mechanical issues (3 percent), and infection (2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Battery life has not been well defined, although some series report a need for repeat surgery for battery replacement less than 10 years after initial device implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Forty-three percent of patients in one longitudinal study required an average of 2.15 additional surgeries over eight years of follow-up, mostly for battery exchange and device relocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H591226\"><span class=\"h3\">Predictors of response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have attempted to identify factors that predict a response to gastric neurostimulation in patients with gastroparesis. In one study, patients with nausea and vomiting and those without narcotic dependence prior to placement of the stimulator had a more favorable clinical response than those with bloating or abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most studies have reported no benefits of gastric stimulation on abdominal pain in gastroparesis, but one observed reductions in pain felt to be secondary to gastric neuropathy after device implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/24,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,46</a>]. Patients with diabetes are more likely than those with idiopathic disease to exhibit clinical improvement following gastric neurostimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. Rates of gastric emptying generally have not been observed to predict symptom response to gastric stimulation. However, some studies noted better responses in those with more prolonged retention, while another found that more severe emptying delays predicted the need to perform stimulator implantation in diabetics but not idiopathic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/18,48,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,48,50,51</a>]. Severity of histologic damage to myenteric ganglia in the stomach may predict response to gastric stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590950\"><span class=\"h3\">Potential candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with documented gastroparesis and severe nausea and vomiting (occurring on average at least once daily) refractory to aggressive antiemetic and prokinetic drug therapy for at least one year may be candidates for electrical stimulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroparesis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H859989\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The gastric electrical neurostimulator (Enterra Therapy system) is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for unrestricted marketing for the treatment of gastroparesis. However, it is approved as a humanitarian use device. In addition, because of probable benefit rather than established effectiveness, the device has also received humanitarian device exemption approval for the treatment of refractory diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis, documented by objective measures of gastric emptying of solids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroparesis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H860104\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Scintigraphic gastric emptying'</a>.)</p><p>In most but not all studies, the neurostimulator has not been documented to reduce fullness, bloating, or acid reflux symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/24,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,49</a>]. As a result, it is uncertain if the therapy will be beneficial if these symptoms predominate. Because of the risk of infection after surgery, patients on immunosuppressive therapy may not be optimal candidates for this technology. The effects of neurostimulation on the developing fetus are unknown; thus gastric neurostimulation should not be performed during pregnancy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric pacing aims to reset a regular slow-wave rhythm. It involves giving the gastric wall a pulse stimulus with a constant current lasting 30 to 500 ms during a nonrefractory period to generate an extra slow wave that propagates along the gastric wall. The benefits of gastric pacing have been suggested in small uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, this method of stimulation is impractical at the present time, as the external current source needed to generate the energy to entrain the slow wave is too large for implantation.</p><p>An early trial of gastric pacing in patients with postoperative gastroparesis observed entrainment of the intrinsic slow wave in 10 of 16 patients; however, this method did not accelerate gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In an open-label trial of gastric pacing, nine patients with prokinetic medication-resistance gastroparesis (five diabetic, three idiopathic, one postvagotomy) received high-energy electrical stimulation at a rate slightly higher than the normal slow-wave frequency through surgically implanted electrodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. When delivered just before and after meals, the pacing stimuli entrained the slow wave in all individuals and underlying rhythm disturbances were reversed in the two patients with spontaneous slow-wave dysrhythmias. After one month, gastroparetic symptoms were markedly improved and eight patients no longer required jejunal tube feedings. Furthermore, solid phase gastric emptying was significantly enhanced compared to prestimulation values.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE DIRECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>New approaches to gastric electrical stimulation continue to be developed. Progress in nonoperative methods of electrode insertion, device miniaturization, battery technology, and the development of devices that deliver variable stimuli may extend the range of options available to patients with severe gastroparesis that is unresponsive to medications. Prototype endoscopically delivered miniaturized stimulators have been developed that can be affixed to the gastric mucosa with enhancement of slow-wave regularity and amplitudes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>Techniques of electrode implantation that avoid the need for laparotomy or laparoscopy may broaden the applicability of gastric neurostimulation methods. Use of endoscopically placed temporary stimulating electrodes has been employed to help predict who might respond to a permanently implanted device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. A percutaneous electrode system has been developed to deliver neurostimulating pulses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. With this technique, a cannula with an internal needle is introduced percutaneously and advanced to the gastric submucosal region. A self-anchoring electrode is then placed through the needle. This method has been used to deliver electrical stimuli for up to eight weeks in patients with gastroparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Electrodes that can be placed during percutaneous gastrostomy placement have also been devised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. These electrodes have been proposed as a means of delivering high-energy pacing stimuli from external current sources.</p><p>Gastric pacing has the disadvantage of requiring a large external current source to deliver the high-energy impulses needed to stimulate gastric contractions. Several multichannel stimulation protocols have been devised to deliver high-energy pulses in sequential fashion that evoke propagating contractions and enhance gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Some groups have used stimulus protocols that entrain intrinsic slow-wave activity, while others advocate high-energy stimuli that stimulate gastric neural activity independently of intrinsic electrical oscillations. In one study, stimulation energies for four-channel pacing were only 1 percent of the levels needed for single-channel pacing, suggesting that implantable pacemakers might be feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Two-channel pacing has shown efficacy in stimulating gastric emptying and reducing symptoms in patients with severe diabetic gastroparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. An impedance-based, feedback-controlled mechanism can turn the pacer on or off depending on the intrinsic contractile state of the gastric wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Such devices that are activated only when triggered have the potential to reduce current requirements and prolong battery life.</p><p>Another area of investigation relates to development of devices that deliver variable stimuli, which exert beneficial effects both on symptoms and gastric emptying. In canine studies, stimulation with low-energy pulses of short duration alternating with high-energy pulses of long duration exerted antiemetic effects and reversed slow-wave dysrhythmias elicited by the emetic stimulus vasopressin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrical-stimulation-for-gastroparesis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Such dual stimulation protocols combine the effective features of both gastric neurostimulation and pacing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9577030\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The principal methods of gastric electrical stimulation are high-frequency gastric electrical stimulation and gastric electrical pacing.
