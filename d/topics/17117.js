Consultative care is primarily given to patients with newly diagnosed kidney disease, including acute kidney injury, hematuria, or proteinuria. Nephrologists also commonly provide primary care or nonrenal related medical care to patients undergoing chronic dialysis. As an example, the initial evaluation of chest pain in the dialysis patient is most often performed by the nephrologist who also oversees renal replacement therapy.</p><p>Factors involved in the debate over primary care provided by a nephrologist include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The time and training required for primary care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of adequate reimbursement for nondialysis-related care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The projected lack of available nephrologists</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Questions about impending systems of global capitation for dialysis care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of general care to be provided</p><p/><p>A paucity of information exists concerning the effect of nephrologist-directed primary care on the morbidity or mortality of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In addition, no practice guidelines or nephrology fellowship training recommendations exist concerning nephrologist-directed primary care for dialysis patients. However, evidence suggests that patient outcome may be influenced by the expertise of the clinician. As an example, clinicians with more experience in treating patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) confer an improved survival when compared with clinicians with less experience with the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Data evaluating the nephrologists' role as the primary care provider to patients with ESRD will be reviewed in this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY CARE AND END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A paucity of objective data exists concerning the nephrologists' role as a primary care provider. Several studies suggest that the volume and type of practice provided by the nephrologist for patients with ESRD may be similar to that of the primary care practitioner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/8,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12-14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1996, a survey of 233 nephrologists found that 90 percent provided primary care to dialysis patients, only 20 percent of whom had another primary care clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A substantial number of these clinicians provided care both for nondialysis-related acute illnesses (85 percent) and for chronic nonrenal disorders, including diabetes mellitus (90 percent), heart disease (75 percent), and gastrointestinal disorders (69 percent). This care was most frequently provided directly by the nephrologist since only 21 percent of clinicians worked with a nurse practitioner or physician assistant in dialysis units.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study found that nephrologists provided routine preventive care comparable with that reported by general internists (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64678\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64678 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, appropriate preventive health care guidelines have not been established for patients with ESRD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2003, a survey of Canadian clinicians found that 54 percent of nephrologists spend approximately one-third of their time providing primary care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Despite feeling confident to manage primary care issues, 80 percent of nephrologists and 85 percent of family clinicians surveyed felt that a nephrologist should not provide all the primary care for dialysis patients. There was also a lack of communication among nephrologists and family clinicians about patient-care issues.</p><p/><p>However, a survey of women on chronic dialysis found that issues related to women's health were less likely to be addressed by nephrologists than by general clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In general, local practice patterns in combination with clinician access continue to influence nephrologists' involvement in the primary care of their dialysis patients. With the growing populations with ESRD and chronic kidney disease, fewer nephrologists may be acting as primary care providers for their dialysis patients. More contemporary study of this issue is needed.</p><p>In addition, the variety of general care that may be appropriate for dialysis patients is wide and often patient specific. For example, hearing loss and ocular diseases are more common among dialysis patients, and depression and cognitive impairment affect significant proportions of dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Is the nephrologist the appropriate clinician to provide disease-specific screening for such general medical problems, or is a primary care provider in a better position to provide and promote such screening and care? In most United States dialysis units, influenza and hepatitis B vaccinations are provided to dialysis patients routinely, as are annual purified protein derivative (PPD) screening tests. Thus, dialysis units have incorporated the provision of some aspects of preventive general medical care as part of their routine practices and policies. However, scheduling routine hearing tests and assessment of cognitive function may ultimately be more beneficial for individual patients. With the onset of bundling of dialysis services for reimbursement, it seems unlikely that dialysis providers will be eager to accept additional responsibility of primary preventive care services.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Perceptions of patients with end-stage renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data suggest that patients undergoing dialysis consider their nephrologist as their primary care provider. However, the primary care provided to hemodialysis patients may differ slightly from that given to peritoneal dialysis patients.</p><p>Two older surveys from the same dialysis center evaluated the perceptions of hemodialysis and continuous peritoneal dialysis concerning their primary medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seventy-one percent of patients did not have a family clinician other than their nephrologist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More hemodialysis patients depended upon their nephrologists to manage minor acute illnesses (91 versus 64 percent of patients treated with continuous peritoneal dialysis, p&lt;0.005).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar percentages (at least 60 percent) of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients reported that their nephrologist managed their nondialysis chronic medical problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No differences were observed among hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients with respect to non-nephrologist-directed preventive care: 58 percent of patients had seen a dentist within one year, and 55 percent had seen an <span class=\"nowrap\">ophthalmologist/optometrist</span> within one year. In addition, 75 percent of women &ge;40 years of age had a mammogram, and nearly 60 percent of the mammograms had been ordered by the nephrologist or nurse practitioner working in the dialysis unit.</p><p/><p>Although there are no similar studies for comparison, most dialysis patients (particularly those in in-center hemodialysis) therefore view their nephrologist as a primary care provider and expect all health care needs to be coordinated through the dialysis unit.</p><p>A Canadian survey of 147 chronic dialysis patients found that most patients (87 percent) had a family clinician and saw their family clinician regularly for new medical problems and prescription refills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These patients felt that their family clinicians were better able to handle primary care issues than were their nephrologists.</p><p>The increasing ESRD population combined with the lack of nephrologists and changes linking reimbursement for dialysis patient care to number of patient visits per month are limiting nephrologists' time to provide primary care to their dialysis patients and encouraging nephrologists to promote the involvement of other primary care providers in dialysis patient care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTIVENESS AND COST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little information exists concerning the relative effectiveness and cost associated with the care provided to the patient with ESRD by nephrologists versus that delivered by generalists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. One preliminary study randomized 174 hemodialysis patients requiring hospitalization to care provided by a nephrologist or a generalist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Care provided by a nephrologist was associated with a significantly lower length of stay (8.1 versus 11.9 days in those treated by an internist) and a trend toward lower cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Lower costs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased morbidity are associated with early referral of patients with chronic kidney disease to nephrologists, thereby implying that subspecialists provide more effective care to such patients than generalists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/7,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21-23</a>].

There is little information about nephrologist-dialysis patient contact and clinical outcomes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study suggested that reduced clinician contact was associated with higher patient mortality, although the exact amount of contact and the nature of the clinician-patient interaction was not well documented or explained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent study of 735 hemodialysis patients treated at 75 not-for-profit US dialysis centers found that less patient-clinician contact was associated with lower patient satisfaction with frequency of patient-clinician visits and lower patient adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, less clinician-patient contact was not associated with patients' overall satisfaction with care, quality of life, hospitalization rates, or mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study examined the effect of linking reimbursement for dialysis to the number of monthly visits and found a significant increase in the number of monthly visits (1.52 versus 3.14) after institution of the new payment system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, there were no clinically significant changes in hospital admissions or days of hospitalization, patient satisfaction, or dialysis indicators such as <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> levels of hemoglobin, phosphorus, catheter use, or shortened or missed treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 130,892 patients from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) database who began dialysis between October 1, 2003 and September 30, 2006 found no difference in survival based on the number of monthly visits by nephrologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, a small but significantly lower risk of first hospitalization (2.3 percent) was observed among patients seen four times per month compared with those seen less frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study of in-center hemodialysis patients dialyzing between 2004 and 2009 showed that more frequent clinician visits following hospitalization would be estimated to reduce re-hospitalization rates from 0.5 to 4.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An assessment of the 2004 tiered fee-for-service system reimbursing nephrologists for number of monthly visits to in-center hemodialysis patients found that payment for dialysis visits increased 13.7 percent in the year following the reform, but there was no benefit on patient survival or kidney transplant listing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An international study of the frequency and duration of patient-doctor contact in hemodialysis facilities using the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) database found a higher mortality for intermediate patient-doctor contact of once per week compared with high patient-doctor contact (more than once per week; hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.96-1.17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This study included 24,498 patients from 778 facilities. The time of patient-doctor contact also influenced the risk of death, with each five-minute shorter time associated with a 5 percent higher risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Problems with the study included possible bias (patient-doctor contact excluded involvement of nonclinician providers with clinician assistants and advanced nurse practitioners; frequency and time of contact was reported by dialysis unit administrators based on usual care) and lack of detail about the nature of the patient-doctor contact. The study is provocative, especially because international differences in patient-doctor contact exist for a variety of reasons. Ongoing attention to the nature of the provider-patient contact in dialysis units and its association with morbidity and mortality is needed.</p><p/><p>Nephrologists' general care of patients with ESRD can also be markedly improved.

For some of these preventive measures and assessments, dialysis units may be increasingly targeted. Some have suggested that nephrology input on specific general medical problems that affect dialysis patients may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrologist-as-primary-care-clinician-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].
