The global costs associated with loss of human life and property from burns are estimates at best, based on hospital care charges, destruction of property, loss of human life, disabilities and loss of potential income, and costs to the criminal justice system in cases of arson, neglect, and assault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>It is estimated that the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Australia, and Denmark spend 0.9 to 2 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on costs related to fires (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82340\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82340 \">table 1</a>).

Compared with 2013, property damage increased by 23 percent from residential fires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In England and Wales, the economic burden of fires in 2008 was estimated at &pound;8.3 billion and includes property damage, casualties, and business disruptions, of which &pound;1.4 billion was attributed to the cost of fatal and nonfatal casualties and &pound;1.5 billion attributed to property damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The cost of anticipation of fire (such as insurance administration and fire protection in buildings) was an additional &pound;3.2 billion. In Australia, the estimated cost of fires in 2005 was AUD $12.5 million, with an estimate of 100 deaths and 3000 injuries annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Typical routes of financial support for the care of these disaster victims may be insufficient to cover the cost of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Anticipated sources of cost include the additional burden of care of patients in excess of usual operating census. Most burn centers run at a capacity of around 80 percent, which means that sudden expansion to surge capacity (150 percent of designated burn beds) would tax human resources and significantly increase expenditures for additional personnel. It may also be difficult, if not impossible, to offload the burden of mass casualty victims to other hospitals because transportation resources may be compromised by the disaster. Moreover, out-of-state hospitals are often reluctant to accept the care of patients in the absence of guarantees by federal or state medical reimbursement programs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">COSTS BY CLINICAL AND PHYSICAL VARIABLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost by age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When medical treatment charges are viewed as a surrogate for intensity of care, certain trends are apparent. The presence of comorbid medical conditions typical in older adults increases the need for more complex services and longer hospitalizations.</p><p>The American Burn Association (ABA) National Burn Repository analyzed cost data of burns incurred between 2006 and 2015 involving 69,015 survivors and 2421 nonsurvivors of burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Total charges for survivors were $94,130. For patients with burns smaller than 20 percent total body surface area (TBSA; whose survival rate is &gt;99 percent), the mean total charges were $60,505. Mean daily charges for survivors were $8179. By contrast, mean total charges for nonsurvivors were $309,656, and mean daily charges were $24,809. The mean daily hospital charges ranged by age from <span class=\"nowrap\">$7402/day</span> for children under five years to <span class=\"nowrap\">$9938/day</span> for the those older than 60 years of age.</p><p>The last decade has seen increases in hospitalization charges. Compared with data from the 2006 ABA National Burn Repository, mean charges for survivors rose from $57,575, an increase of 35 percent when adjusted for inflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This may be because there was an increase for survivors in hospital charges per day from $4336 to $8179, an increase of 56 percent when adjusted for inflation.</p><p>The Multi-Center Benchmarking Study at the Shriners Hospitals for Children, Boston estimated the cost of hospitalization for a cohort of 230 pediatric burn patients between 2001 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The average number of hospitalizations was two per patient, typically over a three- to four-year period of time. The median cost of hospitalization in 2006 was USD $16,331.</p><p>Older adult patients admitted to a New York City burn center from 2000 to 2004 for treatment of a scald burn had mean hospital charges of $113,000 per patient, even though the burns were relatively small (mean 7 percent TBSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost by burn size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients who seek medical care for their burn injuries can be treated and released from emergency departments. As an example, in 2010, only 6.4 percent of burn patients in the United States (US) were hospitalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The average cost (medical cost and work loss) of treating an outpatient burn is much less ($5394) compared with treating a burn in the inpatient setting ($65,022). However, because of the large difference in patient numbers (380,397 versus 25,823, respectively), the total cost of treating outpatient burns each year in the US is far more than the total cost of treating inpatients ($2.1 billion versus $1.7 billion). In addition, the proportion of total cost as work loss is also far greater in outpatients ($1.4 billion versus $761 million).</p><p>The length of stay for survivors is approximately one day per each percent of TBSA burned, up to 70 percent TBSA burns. After that percentage of burn injury, hospital stay is a function of age and injury severities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In general, hospital charges are lower for nonsurvivors compared with survivors for all burn sizes greater than 30 percent TBSA because the shortened hospital stay of nonsurvivors reduces cost of care. At hospitals contributing to the ABA National Burn Repository, charges for survivors ranged from a mean of $60,505 for patients with burns less than 20 percent TBSA to $845,616 for patients with burns greater than 80 percent TBSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For nonsurvivors, charges ranged from $224,807 for patients with less than 20 percent TBSA burns to $182,428 for patients with greater than 80 percent TBSA burns. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost by mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are cost differences between burns caused by fire, with or without smoke inhalation, and those caused by scald. </p><p>Fire and flames are responsible for the bulk of the cost of burns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73977\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73977 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73840 \">figure 2</a>). In 2010, the combined costs (medical costs and work loss) of burn care for all fatal burns was nearly $26 billion. Of those costs, nearly 99 percent were attributed to deaths by fire and flames, compared with only $36 million for scald and contact burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Later information from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) no longer breaks down fire and burn injuries by type.</p><p>The majority of the lost years of life are due to fire and flames (68,272 years), with only 1218 years of life lost due to scalds or contact burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The global costs of fires related to cigarette smoking alone are estimated at USD $27 billion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Fire/flames alone and fire with smoke inhalation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Costs for treating burns resulting from <span class=\"nowrap\">fire/flames</span> are greater than those from burns from scalds or contact with a hot object [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The cost, in terms of life lost and hospital length of stay, is greater when a burn is complicated by smoke inhalation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81666\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81666 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Length of hospital stay &ndash; The average length of stay for all US patients sustaining fire burns in the US between 1998 and 2008 was 13 days (13 days for survivors and 17 days for nonsurvivors) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81666\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81666 \">table 2</a>). The average length of hospital stay for survivors with burns and smoke inhalation was 28 days compared with 11 days for patients without associated inhalation injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality &ndash; US patients with an inhalation injury have a higher proportion of deaths for a given sum of age and TBSA burned, which is called the BAUX score (to illustrate, the same BAUX score describes a 20-year-old patient with a 60 percent TBSA burn as well as a 60-year-old patient with a 20 percent TBSA burn). For example, the mortality rate is less than 3 percent for patients with a BAUX score between 70 and 80 without inhalation injury. However, the mortality rate increases to 14 percent if a smoke inhalation injury is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Global estimates &ndash; Data from lower middle income countries (LMIC) and low-income countries (LIC) regarding cost of burn treatment are scarce. At a single burn center in Lilongwe, Malawi, the mean cost per inpatient admission was only USD $560 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In 2003 in Cape Town, South Africa, the mean total cost per patient burned by kerosene stoves was USD $6410. Extrapolating these costs to South Africa nationwide gives an estimated annual expense of USD $26,250,000, which is more than 50 times the amount expended annually for kerosene in South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Scald</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mean hospital length of stay is shorter for scald burns in comparison with <span class=\"nowrap\">fire/flame</span> burns. Children are more likely to sustain scald burns, contributing to the lower costs of medical care for their burns. Because of the frequency with which scald burns occur, the medical costs are substantial.</p><p>Annual charges for treatment of scald burns in US children under 19 years of age average $14,498 per case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Indirect costs (eg, parental income lost, cost of travel to hospital) are difficult to quantify. The cost of burn wound dressings is frequently not covered by most insurance policies, leaving the parents responsible for purchasing supplies out-of-pocket.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Contact with hot object</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact with a hot object is the third most frequently reported burn. The costs of treating a contact injury are greatest for the age group over 70 years, in which mean charges are in excess of $130,000. The mean hospital stay is longer for burns resulting from contact with a hot object than for fire or scald burns for patients 50 to 70 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459061882\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrical injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cost of care for electrical injuries typically is much higher than the cost of care for flame or scald burns. In Ankara, Turkey, the mean total cost of electrical burns between 2005 and 2008 was USD $22,501, compared with USD $15,250 for other types of burn injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459061902\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT OF COSTS ON PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct medical costs include costs associated with emergency department care, inpatient admissions, rehabilitation, medications, and investigative tests. Also included in direct costs are outpatient visits, medical home health care, medical devices, and ambulance transfers. Most of these costs are borne either by the patient's healthcare insurance plan or by the regional or federal authority, although the amount of reimbursement according to government fee schedules is often less than the cost of treatment for major burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>On the other hand, indirect costs are almost always paid by the patients and their families and can accumulate significantly over time. In Spain, direct healthcare costs of burn patients represent only 20 percent of the total cost of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-costs-of-fires-and-burns/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Indirect medical costs include time spent by family members or other caregivers providing nonmedical care, either in the hospital or at home. Additionally, reduction of working time by both the patient and caregivers results in cumulative lost income. Temporary disability of the patient can evolve into permanent disability, which is particularly disabling for families without provisional plans for short- or long-term disability. Finally, mortality, particularly in the young, leads to a loss of many productive working years, which impacts not only the family but the community as a whole.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The costs of fire-related burns are estimated as costs of anticipation, costs of response, and costs as a consequence of the fire.
