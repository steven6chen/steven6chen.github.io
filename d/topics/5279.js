As an example, in a study of 271 children born to HIV-infected mothers, 234 uninfected, immunologically normal, well children were followed for over one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection-in-infants-and-children-younger-than-18-months/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The mean age of loss of maternal antibody was 10.3 months. One child did not lose maternal antibody until older than 18 months of age. Similarly, in a group of 79 uninfected infants born to mothers infected with HIV, maternal anti-HIV antibody decreased gradually over the first nine months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection-in-infants-and-children-younger-than-18-months/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>For this reason, to identify HIV infection in infants and young children (ie, &lt;18 months of age), HIV virologic testing must be performed using assays that detect HIV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) or other viral components (eg, HIV p24 Ag) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection-in-infants-and-children-younger-than-18-months/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cord blood should not be used for testing because of the possibility of contamination of the sample with maternal blood.

Whole blood specimens or dried blood spot samples may be used for testing. The test should be positive in patients infected with HIV even while they are being treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART).</p><p>Approximately two-thirds of mother-to-child transmission of HIV occurs perinatally, and DNA PCR testing will not detect very recent infection. The sensitivity of HIV-1 DNA PCR testing when performed at birth is 55 percent; it increases to &gt;90 percent by two to four weeks of age, and 100 percent at three and six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection-in-infants-and-children-younger-than-18-months/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. The specificity of HIV-1 DNA PCR is 99.8 percent at birth and 100 percent at one, three, and six months.</p><p>HIV clade B is the predominant viral strain in the United States. Non-clade-B strains are more prevalent in other parts of the world. For example, clade C predominates in Africa and India, and clade E in southeast Asia. Although some early HIV DNA PCR assays may have been less sensitive in detecting non-B clades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection-in-infants-and-children-younger-than-18-months/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], assays with greater sensitivity for non-B clades have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection-in-infants-and-children-younger-than-18-months/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV RNA assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV infection may be identified using either qualitative or quantitative RNA assays. There are a variety of methodologies used to detect HIV RNA including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), b-DNA, transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), and nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA). HIV-1 qualitative RNA assays are widely available in the United States and other developed countries and are being used in place of the HIV DNA PCR. Quantitative RNA assays are the standard viral load test performed for monitoring the response to treatment of HIV infection but may be used as a supplemental diagnostic assay to confirm HIV infection.</p><p>Compared with DNA PCRs, RNA assays may better detect HIV infection at birth, enabling the early initiation of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection-in-infants-and-children-younger-than-18-months/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], which has been shown to reduce infant morbidity and mortality. Studies have suggested that the sensitivity and specificity of qualitative and quantitative HIV RNA assays for identifying neonatal HIV infection are at least as good as those of HIV DNA testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection-in-infants-and-children-younger-than-18-months/abstract/6-8,12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,12,14,15</a>]. However, these studies were not performed in children born to mothers who were receiving potent combination ART, or in children receiving multi-drug prophylaxis. Treatment of either mother or infant with combination ART could be expected to lead to an undetectable viral load measurement, and thus a negative HIV-1 RNA test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection-in-infants-and-children-younger-than-18-months/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-and-interpretation-of-hiv-1-rna-quantitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques and interpretation of HIV-1 RNA quantitation&quot;</a>).</p><p>Current recommendations for serial testing between birth and four to six months of age allow for diagnostic testing to be done after cessation of antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis for infants receiving combination ARV infant prophylaxis if the results of virologic testing were negative while the infant was receiving prophylaxis. </p><p>The available HIV-1 RNA assays are capable of sensitive detection of all the major HIV-1 genetic variants.
