A full-thickness graft includes all the layers of the skin. The survivability of a skin graft depends entirely on the blood supply of the recipient wound bed. </p><p>This topic provides an overview of the use of skin grafts in reconstructive surgery. The use of tissue flaps is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-flaps-for-soft-tissue-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of flaps for soft tissue reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470953452\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN ANATOMY AND DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The skin, which is the largest organ of the body, is responsible for protection, homeostasis, temperature control, and immunologic surveillance. It provides an envelope for the subcutaneous tissue, connective tissue, and deep structures and serves as an attachment site (eg, fascia). It is also the ultimate representation of cosmetic appearance, beauty, and aging. The skin is composed of an outer expendable layer of epidermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54157\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54157 \">figure 1</a>), which is in continuous regeneration, and an inner layer of dermis responsible for elasticity, pliability, and neurovascular supply of the skin. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The epidermis is subdivided into five sublayers or strata: basale, spinosum, granulosum, lucidum, and corneum. The cellular content is substituted by keratin nearly completely in the uppermost stratum of corneum. The basal layer separates epidermis and dermis. The dermoepidermal junction is the area of the skin where pigmentation cellular components are located. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dermis is subdivided into an outer layer called the papillary dermis (separated from the epidermis by the dermoepidermal junction) and an inner layer called the reticular dermis that neighbors the subcutaneous tissue. The dermis is composed of cells, fibers, and a ground substance. The epidermal appendages are subdermal epithelial structures that include sebaceous glands, sweat glands, and hair follicles. The skin is supplied by vascular plexuses from deep-source perforating vessels. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3968758938\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin grafts</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1129750648\"><span class=\"h3\">Autografts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An autograft is the transfer of skin from a donor site to a recipient site in the same individual. Skin autografts can be partial or full thickness. These are the most commonly used grafts for skin reconstruction for a variety of indications.</p><p>The transplanted skin does not have a blood supply and initially survives by absorbing transudate from the recipient site, a process called plasmatic imbibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Neovascularization from the graft bed capillaries then provides a blood supply to the graft over the next 48 to 72 hours. Full circulation is restored within four to seven days.</p><p>Autografts can be harvested as split thickness or full thickness. Split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs), also called partial-thickness grafts, transfer a portion of the donor site skin, including the epidermis and some of the underlying dermis. This allows the donor site to heal from the epidermal elements left behind. Full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) harvest the entire layer of skin as the graft. Thus, no dermal or epidermal elements remain at the donor site, which must be closed by local advancement of the adjoining skin or by a secondary local flap. The process of revascularization takes longer for an FTSG than for an STSG because of the increased thickness of the tissue.</p><p>The advantages and disadvantages are summarized here and described in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H713392056\" class=\"local\">'Split-thickness skin grafting'</a> below and <a href=\"#H713392063\" class=\"local\">'Full-thickness skin grafting'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Split thickness: Good for large areas of coverage, donor sites can be reharvested, fragile, prone to contracture. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Full thickness: Smooth texture and pliability, thicker coverage, reduced take, poor drainage of accumulating fluid. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2770258842\"><span class=\"h3\">Allografts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient physiologic coverage can be achieved using allografts (also called homografts). Allografts are taken from a nongenetically identical human donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Allografts are distributed either fresh or cryopreserved after glycerol preservation from cadavers. The application of a skin allograft over superficial partial-thickness wounds can minimize pain and facilitate reepithelialization. Allogeneic skin is generally used only in burn centers.</p><p>Decellularized dermal skin allograft comprises the epidermis and upper part of the dermis and is retrieved from deceased tissue donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The epidermal and cellular components from the dermis are removed in a sequential decellularization process. Decellularized matrices fully integrate into the burn wound bed after application, replacing lost dermal tissue and providing a scaffold into which the recipient's cells can grow and become vascularized, ultimately regenerating into normal skin.</p><p>Human amniotic membrane has also been successfully used for partial-thickness wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Sterilized, dehydrated human <span class=\"nowrap\">amnion/chorion</span> membrane (dHACM) contains growth factors that promote wound healing, including platelet-derived growth factor A and B, basic fibroblastic growth factor, and transforming growth factor beta 1, and it is stable at ambient temperatures for up to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1276899879\"><span class=\"h3\">Xenografts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin xenografts (heterografts) are obtained from an unrelated species and can be used as temporary skin coverage, particularly for large burn wounds. Only porcine grafts are currently used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Xenografts are generally readily available but may not be as effective as allografts. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2976556570\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin substitutes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several biologic and biosynthetic materials can also be used as skin substitutes temporarily covering wounds. Biologic dressings are used on clean wounds to protect them from desiccation, separating from them once reepithelialization has occurred. (See <a href=\"#H1248765685\" class=\"local\">'Skin substitutes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H320168124\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632143838\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin grafts are indicated for the coverage of a skin defect due to burns, trauma, or excision of a tumor if primary closure cannot be accomplished. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closure of minor skin wounds with sutures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin grafts can also be used to cover and promote healing of chronic wounds provided the bed of the wound is well prepared and vascularized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds#H105660167\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment of chronic wounds&quot;, section on 'Wound coverage/closure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin grafts may also be used as an adjunct to tissue flap reconstructive techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-flaps-for-soft-tissue-reconstruction#H2701269427\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of flaps for soft tissue reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Skin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin substitutes replace the biological properties of some parts of the skin by providing covering of an intact dermis or by replacing it for full-thickness dermal defects.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1737511960\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of coverage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether to use a skin graft versus a tissue flap depends upon the condition and requirement of the recipient bed. A skin graft depends on the vascularity of the recipient site. A well-vascularized bed can accept a graft while a devascularized bed (eg, cartilage or bone) requires flap coverage. In addition, size, location, and aesthetics often dictate the choice. Initially, a skin graft is erythematous and irregular, but over time as the graft matures (three to six months), the graft will smooth out but will retain the color and consistency of the donor site, which is a major shortcoming of a skin graft. A local flap will provide a better aesthetic result than a graft because it allows replacement of &quot;like with like.&quot; Moreover, when large defects need to be filled or structures recreated, a flap will be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-flaps-for-soft-tissue-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of flaps for soft tissue reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Whether to choose a split-thickness or full-thickness skin graft depends on several factors. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size of the defect to cover</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anatomic area to reconstruct</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The availability of donor sites</p><p/><p>It is important to take into account the anticipated wound contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In general, the degree of contraction is less the thicker the skin graft. Minimal wound contraction occurs with full-thickness skin grafts. However, with a thicker graft, better vascularity is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Full-thickness skin grafts are generally reserved for reconstruction of areas of special anatomic and functional importance that require a more pliable reconstruction than can be offered by split-thickness skin grafts. Such areas include cosmetically sensitive areas like the head, eyelids, perioral areas, and neck, and functional areas like the hands. </p><p>Examples for choosing between split thickness and full thickness grafts include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a chronic ulcer, a thinner graft will have decreased metabolic needs, and a split-thickness graft is often chosen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients requiring grafts on the face, a full-thickness skin graft is preferred because of the aesthetic benefits of minimal contraction, as well as better color match and contour.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with large skin defects of the trunk or extremities away from joints, split-thickness skin grafts are preferable because wound contraction will result in a smaller area of scarring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients requiring grafts over areas of mobility (joints) or functionally crucial areas (fingertips), full-thickness skin grafts are preferable because of the functional benefits of minimal contraction.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4238490803\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor site selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The donor site is selected to minimize discomfort and cosmetic issues while maximizing the outcome at the recipient site, which depends on the desired color, texture, and thickness of the skin at the recipient site. Donor site selection also depends on the availability of tissue. When large areas of skin coverage are needed, any area of the body may be used as a donor site. The donor site of a split-thickness skin graft will remain hyperpigmented for a number of months before returning to normal.</p><p>The quality of the donor site skin should also be evaluated for evidence of prior sun damage (eg, keratoses) and prior scarring. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the face, it is desirable to replace &quot;like with like&quot; and use skin as close to the recipient site as possible. As an example, nasal tip grafts are often best taken from the preauricular skin rather than the supracervical skin as the color and thickness match are better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An open wound of the trunk can be grafted from almost any donor site as the skin color and texture are not as important. The upper lateral thigh is a good choice for skin grafting an area on the trunk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Split-thickness skin grafts from the scalp can be used for resurfacing the face and to improve the color match of the skin paddle for patients previously treated with a free flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p>Donor sites for full-thickness skin grafting are from areas of redundant and pliable skin that can be harvested and closed without tension like the groin, medial arm, supraclavicular area, pre- and post-auricular area, and abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3918642670\"><span class=\"h2\">Recipient site preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper recipient site preparation is important for both split-thickness and full-thickness skin grafts. The wound bed must be well vascularized and free of all necrotic or ischemic tissue, and without inflammation or infection. </p><p>Surgically created wounds are designed to leave a well-vascularized bed, so no special preparation is required. Similarly, once injured and devascularized tissue is removed, acute traumatic wounds often have a healthy bed. </p><p>Chronic wounds may take a period of dressing changes to promote neovascularization in the bed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds#H45051884\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment of chronic wounds&quot;, section on 'Wound bed preparation'</a>.)</p><p>Granulation tissue can be heavily colonized, and, at the time of skin grafting, it should be gently debrided back to the wound base. Skin margins should be trimmed to expose healthy, unscarred dermis. Hemostasis must be meticulous to prevent blood or fluid collections from accumulating beneath the graft because these are a common cause of graft failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. If the base is bony or tendinous, a graft may not take. The recipient site should also be thoroughly irrigated prior to graft placement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3363149021\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumescent infiltration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumescent infiltration with large diluted volumes of local anesthesia (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> maximum dose with epinephrine) in normal saline reduces intraoperative blood loss and postoperative pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Various techniques are used, and the devices used for injecting tumescent infiltration into the skin vary from simple syringes and needles for small areas to powerful mechanically assisted devices that deliver large volumes of infiltration through large, wide needles. Our standard infiltration of both burned tissue and donor sites is one liter of normal saline with an ampule of 1:1000 epinephrine. For local anesthesia, we use a mixture of 1% lidocaine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> 0.25%. The bupivacaine provides longer duration analgesia for donor site pain as these areas are the most problematic for postoperative pain control. </p><p>Tumescent infiltration to facilitate graft harvesting can reduce intraoperative blood loss and postoperative pain, particularly in the setting of burn surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/17-19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19,21</a>]. In a nonrandomized study, tumescent infiltration of the donor and burn sites with subdermal injections of diluted epinephrine resulted in a significant reduction of intraoperative blood loss compared with a similar group of burn patients not treated with these techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H561992127\"><span class=\"h2\">Grafting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Techniques by which to accomplish partial-thickness and full-thickness skin autografting are well established and follow an orderly sequence. Allografts and xenografts are placed in a similar manner but without the need to harvest tissue. The steps involved are discussed fully below. (See <a href=\"#H713392056\" class=\"local\">'Split-thickness skin grafting'</a> below and <a href=\"#H713392063\" class=\"local\">'Full-thickness skin grafting'</a> below.)</p><p>The application of skin substitutes is similar, also without the need to harvest tissue. (See <a href=\"#H1248765685\" class=\"local\">'Skin substitutes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1650789753\"><span class=\"h2\">Graft take</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of graft take, or skin graft survival, for split-thickness grafts (sheet or meshed) is approximately 95 percent. Optimal rates require that the wound is free of infection and that the patient has optimal infection control and nutritional status. The graft take for full-thickness skin grafts is similar, provided the wound is appropriately and freshly debrided, the patient's physiology and ability to heal is unaffected, and there are no microbiology concerns. When there is less-than-optimal debridement, infection, or deranged physiology, graft take will be compromised. </p><p>The local and systemic factors that decrease the survival of skin grafts are similar for split-thickness and full-thickness grafts. The main factor that reduces graft take and survival for skin grafts is a lack of initial adhesion to the recipient site due to the presence of a hematoma or seroma that inhibits revascularization. For full-thickness skin grafts, small perforations may not be sufficient to drain any accumulating fluid. Other local factors that are associated with decreased skin graft survival include inadequate vascularity, such as the presence of unvascularized bone or tendon or local tissue hypoxia from underlying vascular disease, prior irradiation or smoking, excess mobility, and placement in an area of high contact or friction (eg, back, anorectal area). </p><p>Systemic factors that may decrease the survival of split-thickness skin grafts include older age, malnutrition, medical comorbidities, and pharmacologic therapies known to affect wound healing (eg, glucocorticoids), among others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H713392056\"><span class=\"h1\">SPLIT-THICKNESS SKIN GRAFTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The split-thickness skin graft (STSG) is the most frequently used donor for tissue coverage. A split-thickness skin graft includes the epidermis and varying amounts of dermis, ranging between <span class=\"nowrap\">8/1000</span> of an inch (0.196 millimeters) and <span class=\"nowrap\">12/1000</span> of an inch (0.294 millimeters). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2412107750\"><span class=\"h2\">Advantages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main advantages of split-thickness skin grafting include the ability to cover large surface areas with less donor skin, and that donor sites may be reharvested once healing is complete (generally in 10 to 15 days). Reharvesting, together with expansion of the graft by meshing techniques, and combination with allograft techniques (sandwich technique: 1:2 autograft covered with 1:4 allograft) allow for coverage of larger defects. A degree of caution needs to be observed in older adults in whom the dermis is thinner; injudicious thick harvesting may lead to difficult-to-heal wounds. </p><p>Prior to reharvesting, the patient's nutritional status must be optimized, and the donor site wound must show evidence of reepithelialization with no evidence of local infection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50049672\"><span class=\"h2\">Disadvantages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disadvantages of split-thickness skin grafting include fragility, abnormal pigmentation, lack of smooth texture, and lack of hair. The lack of a dermal element and, thus, limited pliability and elasticity increase the likelihood of contracture. When used to reconstruct large burns of the face, split-thickness skin grafts may yield an undesirable, mask-like appearance. In addition, the donor site is an additional cause of significant pain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1440790669\"><span class=\"h2\">STSG technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The steps involved during split-thickness skin grafting are described in the sections below. Harvesting can be performed using local anesthesia if the size of the graft harvesting is small. Otherwise, the procedure is performed with additional sedation or under general anesthesia.</p><p>The harvesting area is chosen according to availability. Characteristically, a convex area is chosen for ease of harvesting, such as the lateral and anterior thigh. (See <a href=\"#H4238490803\" class=\"local\">'Donor site selection'</a> above.)</p><p>The area is shaved and marked, and tumescent infiltration with a local anesthetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epinephrine mixed with saline is performed at the donor and burn wound sites. (See <a href=\"#H3363149021\" class=\"local\">'Tumescent infiltration'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1931461007\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin harvest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The methods of split-thickness skin graft harvesting have evolved from free-hand with a knife to the use of a handheld dermatome. Either an electrical or compressed air-powered dermatome (authors' choice) can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>The dermatome has a large scalpel-like blade with adjustable depth gauge. Dermatomes are graded in multiples of <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000</span> of an inch and <span class=\"nowrap\">5/100</span> of a millimeter, with most grafts harvested between <span class=\"nowrap\">8/1000</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">12/1000</span> of an inch. Harvesting thicker grafts requires a longer time for donor sites to heal and may preclude that site from repeat harvesting, which is particularly important in burn patients. </p><p>The harvesting area is layered with liquid paraffin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a>, or surgical water-based lubricating gel to reduce friction and facilitate harvesting. The donor site is put on tension by the assistant and the dermatome engaged on the skin surface at an angle of approximately 45 degrees and gently pushed forward while exerting a modest amount of downward pressure on the dermatome. The partial-thickness skin will come off the blade as the dermatome is moved forward. At the completion of the harvest, the dermatome is lifted, which usually severs the graft. If the graft does not come completely off the donor site, a scalpel can be used to complete the final cut. The graft is then transferred to the recipient site, or meshed prior to transfer. (See <a href=\"#H2331169530\" class=\"local\">'Graft meshing'</a> below.)</p><p>Intraoperatively, while the graft is being meshed and inset into the recipient site, hemostasis at the donor site can be achieved using gauze soaked in a solution of one liter normal saline and one ampule of 1:1000 epinephrine. Local anesthesia (generally <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> 0.5% with epinephrine) can be infiltrated at the donor site to provide pain relief in the perioperative period. STSG donor sites are subsequently covered with a nonadherent dressing. (See <a href=\"#H2972619160\" class=\"local\">'Donor site dressings and care'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2331169530\"><span class=\"h3\">Graft meshing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The harvested split-thickness skin graft can be expanded through a meshing device (1:1.5 to 1:9 expansion) to increase its surface area when additional coverage is needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77019\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77019 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57087\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57087 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63714\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63714 \">picture 3</a>). Meshed skin grafts also allow fluid to drain freely from the interstices (ie, openings) of the meshed graft, which improves graft take. The most common ratios for meshing skin grafts include 1:1 mesh (mini mesh), 2:1 mesh, and 4:1 mesh (with overlying 2:1 meshed allograft), depending on the availability of donor sites. </p><p>Larger mesh ratios are reserved for patients with limited donor sites such as patients with severe burns. However, meshed grafts heal with more scarring due to the secondary healing of the interstices and are therefore less aesthetically appealing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70840\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70840 \">picture 4</a>) compared with sheet (unmeshed) skin grafts. Accordingly, graft meshing is reserved for areas where the aesthetic outcome is of less importance. Unmeshed sheet grafts are used in cosmetically sensitive areas, such as the face and hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>The Meek technique, first described in 1958, is an alternative technique for expanding autografts. It uses a special dermatome and prefolded gauzes to obtain a regular expansion of autograft squares from small pieces of split skin grafts of up to a 1:9 expansion. The Meek techniques can be used on its own or combined with other techniques such as allograft, dermal templates, or cultured keratinocytes both in the adult and pediatric populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>].

The technique is straightforward, and the staples are relatively inexpensive. If the wound has an unusual surface contour, multiple tacking sutures can also be used. Placement of a large number of staples will generally require removal in the operating room and may require general anesthesia. There is also the potential of leaving embedded staples in the wound, which may result in nonhealing wounds, infection, and pain. </p><p>For small skin grafts in sensitive anatomic areas in our practice, we use 4-0 or 5-0 rapidly absorbable suture (eg, 4-0 Vicryl Rapide, <span class=\"nowrap\">5-0/6-0</span> Vicryl Rapide for the head and neck).

The type used typically depends upon surgeon preference and availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/34,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,38-40</a>]. A review that included 35 randomized trials and 22 observational studies noted difficulties in making accurate comparisons between moist and nonmoist dressings because of methodological heterogeneity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Although nonmoist adherent dressings may be the most commonly applied dressings to the donor site (eg, bismuth-impregnated petrolatum gauze), there is some weak evidence to support the use of moist dressings, which appear to be associated with less pain and may have lower rates of infection and improved quality of healing. </p><p>In our unit, we place a nonadherent dressing pad (eg, Telfa Clear [polyethylene terephthalate], Mepitel [silicone], or Jelonet [paraffin gauze]) as the contact layer on the donor site, covered with a layer of thick gauze to absorb any fluid and secured with a cr&ecirc;pe wrap bandage, Elastoplast elastic bandage, or Tegaderm adhesive dressing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In a pilot study assessing pain and ease of removal of the donor site dressings, Telfa Clear was easier to remove and less painful compared with Jelonet; however, donor sites covered with Jelonet appeared to heal faster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The film dressings had lower pain scores and complication rates compared with gauze dressings. However, there is a tendency for moist dressings to be labor intensive for both the patient and the caregiver. In a randomized trial that included 22 patients, management of the donor site with an absorbent synthetic dressing with properties of natural epithelium (ie, Suprathel) had similar healing times and reepithelialization rates compared with Jelonet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, there was less pain, less frequent dressing changes, and better attachment to donor site surfaces with Suprathel.</p><p>For donor sites on the back, we use Biobrane as the primary contact dressing, covered with a layer of Jelonet, povidone iodine-soaked gauze, dry gauze, and a securing dressing. Some have noted that attempts at using moist dressings such as Tegaderm and Biobrane improved pain control, but with a higher rate of drainage from the site and need for caregiver intervention prior to healing. </p><p>Hydrocolloid dressings may be associated with the fastest healing rates of the donor site wound following split-thickness harvesting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/34,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,43</a>].

The risk of infection was higher for patients managed with gauze compared with all other dressings (18.0 versus 7.6 percent, relative risk [RR] 2.38, 95% CI 1.14-4.99).

Full-thickness skin grafts have an aesthetic advantage when used to cover wounds affecting the face and hands.

Reharvesting in the same area is limited by the elasticity of surrounding skin. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not all areas of the body are suitable as donor sites, because a full-thickness skin graft should ideally match the recipient site for color, skin thickness, and texture. A drawback of applying a full-thickness skin graft to the face is the potential color mismatch, with results varying from hypopigmentation to hyperpigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of interstices in full-thickness skin grafts increases the risk for hematoma and seroma formation and may reduce graft take [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Harvesting can be performed using local anesthesia if the size of the graft harvesting is small. Otherwise, the procedure is performed with additional sedation or under general anesthesia.</p><p>The harvesting area is chosen according to availability. There is sufficient laxity and pliability of the skin in the supraclavicular and groin regions and the inner upper arm areas to permit mobilization of the surrounding tissues to achieve a primary closure of the donor site.

A template of<sup> </sup>the defect should be made using a flexible material (eg, sterile paper or gauze) that can conform to the defect. This allows for a &quot;tailor-made&quot; fit for the harvested skin, without removing more skin than is required. </p><p>Donor site incision should be planned along natural skin creases (relaxed skin tension lines or Langer's lines), particularly in the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50913\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50913 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57566\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57566 \">figure 3</a>). Violating these lines leads to more visible scars as a result of wound closure. Excess tension in a skin closure can lead to unsightly hypertrophic scarring. </p><p>The incision is made with a scalpel, and sharp dissection of the full thickness of skin is performed. The use of electrocautery during graft harvest should be minimized to minimize thermal injury to the graft. We depilate and remove the subcutaneous adipose tissue from the dermis of the full-thickness skin graft (ie, defatting), as needed, prior to placing it in the recipient site. This can be accomplished using sharp, fine scissors (eg, McIndoe scissors), holding the graft between the thumb and the index of the nondominant hand on top of a wet gauze swab. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3878494026\"><span class=\"h3\">Graft placement and fixation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The burn wound is debrided and must be free of a hematoma, exudate, or infection.

The template serves as a scaffold for neovascular and cellular infiltration from the wound bed. This scaffold gradually degrades; following a period of two to three weeks, the silicone epidermal layer is removed and the burn wound is covered with a thin split-thickness skin graft. Use of Integra has been gradually extended from the acute coverage of full-thickness burns to a versatile additional tool for reconstruction. In our practice, we use it more often in the reconstructive phase than in the acute cover period. </p><p>One drawback of a dermal regeneration template is the potential for infection. A prospective multicenter trial that included 216 burn patients found that the rate of invasive infection at Integra-treated sites was 3 percent and the superficial wound infection rate was 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

In two trials, Integra-treated burns had a significantly faster time to healing (11 versus 14 days) compared with autografts, allografts, or xenografts but a significantly lower proportion of patients with &ge;75 percent of wound closure. No high-quality data from prospective trials are available.</p><p>Integra Dermal Regeneration Template is applied as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The burn is debrided and hemostasis is performed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Integra can be applied as a sheet or meshed 1:1 without overexpansion.

The matrices are treated with irradiation (approximately 1000 Gy) and stored at room temperature. The main advantages of Matriderm are that it can be used as a one-stage procedure with an STSG and that it may minimize loss in pliability and elasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. This product is available outside the United States and is widely used in western European countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain, among others. </p><p>The application process is straightforward. One option is to moisten the sheet of Matriderm with normal saline prior to applying it to the burn defect. Another option that we have found useful is to apply the dry template to the burn, then wet it with saline. This reduces the difficulty in handling. A thin STSG is applied to the reconstruction template. Our clinical experience has revealed no dramatic differences in terms of pliability and scar quality between the one- and two-stage procedures. </p><p>A prospective study of 42 paired burn wounds and 44 paired scar reconstructions found that burn patients treated with the <span class=\"nowrap\">collagen/elastin</span> dermal template with an STSG had no statistical difference for elasticity, scar contraction, Vancouver Burn Skin Score, and patient's impression at one year compared with burn patients treated with the conventional STSG alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

After removal of the bandages, the graft will be dry, and a gentle daily application of moisturizer is helpful. </p><p>When Integra is used, we cover it with a double layer of nonadhesive iodine-impregnated dressing as the primary dressing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4119846301\"><span class=\"h2\">Graft immobilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immobilization of the graft to the recipient bed is imperative to prevent shearing of the graft <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> accumulation of fluid under the graft, which would prevent the process of neovascularization, thus causing skin graft failure. Although meshed split-thickness skin grafts can drain underlying wound fluid through the interstices, the graft still needs to be immobilized to facilitate healing. For full-thickness skin grafts, immobilization is also crucial as there are no mesh interstices to allow fluid drainage. A bolster dressing or a negative pressure wound therapy device can be used to ensure immobilization of the healing graft. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=negative-pressure-wound-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Negative pressure wound therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Negative pressure wound therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50588\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50588 \">figure 4</a>) minimizes shearing and subgraft fluid accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. For large areas, and specifically for those close to joints, we always use negative pressure wound therapy dressings in the immediate post-graft period. It is also our preference for most other areas, when available. The device is usually left in place for 5 to 10 days after graft placement.</p><p>If negative pressure wound therapy is not available, independent of the size of the graft, we use a bolster. Bolster dressings have long been used to cover the graft and hold it in place. Bolstering and tie-over of the grafts may help in protecting the skin grafts, though their usefulness in applying pressure in the interface between recipient and graft area to ensure better take has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. A gauze or cotton bolster is usually applied to absorb the exudate. The bolster dressing can be sewn in place by placing stitches <span class=\"nowrap\">(3-0/4-0</span> nylon or polypropylene, <span class=\"nowrap\">5-0/6-0</span> in the head and neck) around the periphery of the graft and leaving them long enough to tie together over the bolster. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258794083\"><span class=\"h2\">Limb immobilization and elevation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Split-thickness skin grafts that are placed in areas subjected to shear because of motion (eg, axilla, antecubital fossa, or popliteal fossa) also require stabilization with a splint prior to leaving the operating room. Postoperatively, splinting provides for anatomical and functional preservation and minimizes early abnormal scar formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].</p><p>In addition, extremities that are grafted should be elevated for four to five days to decrease postoperative edema. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2510099148\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Close surveillance of the grafted wound facilitates early detection of graft shearing, hematomas, seromas, or any other problems that may affect graft survival. Thus, we inspect all recipient sites on postoperative day 2 and donor sites at postoperative day 5. For skin substitutes (eg, Matriderm, Integra), we remove the bolster for inspection at three to five days. </p><p>In the early postoperative period, immobilization of the reconstructed grafted wound by limiting physical activity is important to avoid rebleeding, hematoma, or dehiscence until graft inspection. This period of rest allows successful graft adhesion and revascularization. Precautions are maintained until early maturation and donor site healing have occurred, typically at approximately one month post-procedure. </p><p>A fundamental component to postoperative management is mobilization of the patient with the initiation of occupational therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical therapy. A careful balance must be achieved between graft protection and preservation of motion in joints. Early mobilization is necessary to preserve function, but excessive early joint mobilization before full graft take or adequate wound healing will shear and destroy grafts by interfering with graft adhesion and compromise the reconstruction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3648684072\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632143779\"><span class=\"h2\">Graft failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Graft failure can result from insufficient vascularity of the recipient site, hematoma, seroma, infection, excessive tension, or mechanical shearing forces. Proper preparation of the wound bed, meticulous hemostasis, careful inset of the graft, and proper dressing along with immobilization during the healing period can help avoid most of these complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Comorbidities, including diabetes, smoking, and protein or vitamin deficiencies, can affect vascularity and wound healing. In addition, medications such as steroids, immunosuppressive medications, and anticoagulants can interfere with wound healing. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infection is most commonly due to methicillin-resistant coagulase-positive staphylococci (MRSA), beta-hemolytic streptococci, or pseudomonas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cultures should be obtained to direct antibiotic treatment. Partial graft loss can be treated with wet to moist saline-soaked gauze or other local dressings and usually will heal secondarily. Complete graft loss requires reassessment of the bed. When the wound bed is well vascularized, then regrafting can be attempted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79416050\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertrophic scarring and keloid formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All grafted areas will leave a scar at both the recipient and the donor site. Such a scar can turn into a hypertrophic or keloid scar that may require appropriate management. Preventive measures and treatment of established scars are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keloids and hypertrophic scars&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-scarring-and-keloids-following-burn-injuries#H4242189838\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic scarring and keloids following burn injuries&quot;, section on 'Preventive strategies and their efficacy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1933287\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The routine use of skin grafts and flaps has dramatically broadened the ability of the surgeon to perform reconstructive surgery and improve outcomes and quality of life for trauma patients, burn patients, and cancer patients. (See <a href=\"#H713392042\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A skin graft is defined as a transfer of skin from the donor site to the recipient site without the benefit of any blood supply. (See <a href=\"#H470953452\" class=\"local\">'Skin anatomy and definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Split-thickness skin grafts transfer a portion of the donor site skin layer including the epidermis and some of the underlying dermis. Full-thickness skin grafts harvest the entire layer of skin as the graft. (See <a href=\"#H470953452\" class=\"local\">'Skin anatomy and definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper preparation of the recipient site is crucial for both split-thickness and full-thickness skin grafts. Prior to grafting any wound bed, the surgeon must make certain that the bed is ready to accept the graft and free from necrotic or ischemic tissue, inflammation, and infection. (See <a href=\"#H3918642670\" class=\"local\">'Recipient site preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main cause of skin graft failure is graft movement, which interferes with neovascularization and encourages fluid collection under the graft, which can lead to infection and poor revascularization.
