The majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube (84 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but other possible sites include cervical, interstitial (also referred to as cornual; a pregnancy located in the proximal segment of the fallopian tube that is embedded within the muscular wall of the uterus), hysterotomy scar, intramural, ovarian, or abdominal. In addition, in rare cases, a multiple gestation may be heterotopic (include both a uterine and extrauterine pregnancy).</p><p>Ectopic pregnancy is a potentially life-threatening condition, usually requiring expeditious surgical or medical treatment to reduce the risk of rupture of the fallopian tube or another structure and catastrophic hemorrhage. However, in a small proportion of cases in which the risk of tubal rupture is minimal, expectant management may be offered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Women who are candidates for expectant management of ectopic pregnancy require informed consent about the risks of this strategy and close observation until the pregnancy has resolved.</p><p>Expectant management of ectopic pregnancy will be reviewed here.

We define decreasing as a decrease of &gt;10 percent across two consecutive measurements.</p><p/><p>Patients with no extrauterine or intrauterine mass on TVUS are described as a pregnancy of unknown location since imaging and laboratory assessment do not clearly distinguish between a failed intrauterine pregnancy and a resolving ectopic pregnancy in an early pregnancy. An extrauterine mass that can be characterized as <strong>not</strong> being suspicious for an ectopic pregnancy (eg, corpus luteum) is not a contraindication for expectant management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasonography of pregnancy of unknown location&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are few data to determine the threshold hCG level that allows for expectant management of ectopic pregnancy without unnecessary risk of tubal rupture. The rate of tubal rupture without treatment is high. This was illustrated in a population-based study in France that reported an 18 percent rate of tubal rupture among 843 women with ectopic pregnancy; women treated with MTX were excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Reported rates of rupture after MTX treatment are 7 to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-choosing-a-treatment#H206768603\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Choosing a treatment&quot;, section on 'Outcome'</a>.)</p><p>Several studies have evaluated use of a hCG threshold up to 1000 to 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>]. The two randomized trials that have evaluated expectant management of suspected ectopic pregnancy used hCG thresholds up to &lt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> for ectopic pregnancy or &lt;2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> for PUL. However, the trials each included less than 100 women, and the median hCG was approximately 400 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span>. These trials found resolution of the pregnancy with expectant management alone in 59 and 76 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. One trial found that the risk of failure increased by 0.12 percent for each unit increase in hCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1242761739\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>The results of these studies show that with increasing hCG levels there remains a substantial risk of tubal rupture with expectant management. Thus, taking into account the potentially serious risks of tubal rupture and hemorrhage with ectopic pregnancy and the safety and efficacy of medical and surgical treatment (efficacy is approximately 88 percent for MTX or laparoscopy and 97 percent with laparotomy in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]), we recommend that more stringent hCG criterion (&le;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL)</span> for expectant management. </p><p>If expectant management is offered, the patient must be aware of and accept the risk of tubal rupture and be willing and able to comply with follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expectant treatment should not be attempted or management should be converted to pharmacologic or surgical treatment in women with known or suspected ectopic pregnancy with at least one of the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamically unstable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of impending or ongoing ectopic mass rupture (ie, severe or persistent abdominal pain or &gt;300 mL of free peritoneal fluid outside the pelvic cavity).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> (at any time during this pregnancy) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increasing.

Success rates for expectant management of ectopic pregnancy of 47 to 100 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The wide variation is due, in part, to differences in inclusion criteria as well as the definition of success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/3,7,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,11-13</a>]. </p><p>Several randomized trials have evaluated expectant management of ectopic pregnancy and have demonstrated success rates comparable to MTX therapy. The amount of time to reach an undetectable hCG was also comparable with MTX. Few patients managed expectantly had complications or had to convert to MTX or surgery.</p><p>The available randomized trials included patients with hCG levels higher than the 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> threshold we use in our practice, but most did not include an analysis of success rates at different threshold levels of hCG below 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span>. Thus, these data do not give information regarding choice of an hCG threshold of 200, 400, 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL,</span> or higher. Thus, we prefer to use a low hCG level as a criterion to avoid unnecessary risk of unsuccessful treatment or tubal rupture. These trials often included women with ultrasound evidence of an ectopic gestation, which is also a contraindication based on our practice. Similarly, we prefer to be conservative when offering expectant management. </p><p>The two largest randomized trials that compared expectant management with standard MTX therapy (standard dose and intramuscular [IM] route of administration) were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial (n = 80) assigned women with a conclusive ultrasound diagnosis (those with an embryonic heartbeat or hemoperitoneum were excluded) of tubal ectopic pregnancy and a serum hCG <em>&lt;</em>1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> to MTX (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> IM) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. No significant difference was found in the rate of uneventful decline of hCG (MTX: 83 percent versus placebo: 76 percent) or in the median time to pregnancy resolution (18 versus 14 days). Women who required additional treatment included: expectant management (24 percent had surgery; one woman had a blood transfusion) and MTX (17 percent had surgery). The risk of failure was impacted by hCG level across both groups; the risk increased by 0.12 percent for each unit increase in hCG. The median hCG was approximately 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> in each group. Risk of failure in women with a baseline hCG 1000 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> was lower in the MTX group (38 versus 67 percent); this did not reach statistical significance, but the study lacked sufficient statistical power.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another trial (n = 73) assigned women with an ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy of unknown location (those with a viable ectopic pregnancy, signs of tubal rupture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> active intraabdominal bleeding were excluded) and a plateauing hCG (&lt;50 percent hCG increase or decrease between initial evaluation and four days later) to MTX (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight IM with a maximum of 100 mg) or expectant management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The hCG limits were &lt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> for ectopic pregnancy or &lt;2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> for pregnancy of unknown location (median hCG was 535 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> in the MTX group and 708 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> in the expectant group). An uneventful decline of hCG was achieved with initial treatment more often in women treated with MTX than expectant management (76 versus 59 percent), but this did not reach statistical significance. The median serum hCG clearance time was comparable (MTX: 34 days and expectant: 38 days). Women who required additional treatment included: expectant management (28 percent of women were treated with MTX; 13 percent [4 of 32] had surgery) and MTX (22 percent received additional MTX injections; 2 percent [1 of 41] had surgery). There were no tubal ruptures or serious complications. No difference in health-related quality of life was found between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This study was limited by the broad definition given to a plateauing hCG (&plusmn;50 percent).</p><p/><p>Other randomized trials include a small series (n = 23) that found comparable success rates for MTX and placebo (90 and 92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another trial used oral MTX (2.5 mg for five days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Mean hCG levels did not differ significantly between groups; in the placebo group, the mean hCG was 211 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> (range 30 to 1343 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL)</span>. Ultrasound findings were not reported. In both groups, 77 percent of patients recovered without the need for laparoscopy. A limitation of this trial was the low dose MTX. For comparison, therapeutic doses for rheumatoid arthritis are typically at least 15 mg orally per day. Thus, it is not surprising that both groups had similar outcomes.</p><p>A literature review of studies with a total of 700 women reported a median success rate of 69 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-pregnancy-expectant-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].
