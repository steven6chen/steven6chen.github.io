Historically, HRS cells have been enigmatic and difficult to study, as they often constitute less than 1 percent of the cells in involved tissues. The central pathogenic issues in HL are: the origin of HRS cells, the identity of the events underlying the transformation of HRS cells, and the nature of the signals that produce the intense, characteristic tissue response.</p><p>The mystery of the origin of HRS cells was ultimately solved by elegant molecular studies that relied on single cell micromanipulation of HRS cells, coupled with amplification of RNA and genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These techniques established a B cell origin for HRS cells in the vast majority of cases of HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], and led to the identification of recurrent molecular abnormalities in HRS cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg</span> cell and the pathobiology of classical HL will be reviewed here. The role of Epstein-Barr virus infection in the development of HL is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of Epstein-Barr virus in Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Association with infectious mononucleosis and EBV'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSICAL VERSUS NON-CLASSICAL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One complication when discussing the nature of <span class=\"nowrap\">Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg</span> (HRS) cells is heterogeneity within the diagnostic category of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). HL is currently divided into two broad groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classical HL, which includes the nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte-rich, and lymphocyte-depletion subtypes. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Non-classical&quot; HL, which includes only the uncommon nodular lymphocyte predominant subtype and comprises approximately 5 percent of HLs. </p><p/><p>The distinction between these groups is based on differences in the morphology and phenotype of the HRS cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57079 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In nodular lymphocyte predominant HL, the prevalent tumor cell is the &quot;lymphocytic and histiocytic&quot; (L&amp;H) HRS variant, which often has a polypoid nuclear contour resembling a popcorn kernel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63097\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63097 \">picture 3</a>); classic HRS cells with multiple nuclear lobes and large, inclusion-like nucleoli are rare or absent. The L&amp;H variants of the nodular lymphocyte predominant subtype express B cell markers, grow within expanded networks of follicular dendritic cells, have productive immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, and show evidence of ongoing somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>], features that resemble normal germinal center B cells and some of their malignant counterparts, such as follicular lymphoma cells. Retention of the lymphocyte predominant subtype within the HL category is based on the frequent presence of rare cells resembling classical HRS cells, the predominance of background reactive cells, and certain clinical features (such as response to therapy) that are more typical of HL than non-Hodgkin lymphomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, the HRS cells of classical forms of HL have been much more mysterious and are still incompletely understood; these cells are the focus of this review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CELLULAR ORIGIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A morphologic hallmark of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is the presence of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells. Studies using HL cell lines suggest that bi- or multi-nuclear RS cells result from incomplete cytokinesis of mononuclear Hodgkin cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Another striking characteristic is that <span class=\"nowrap\">Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg</span> (HRS) cells of classical HL fail to exhibit phenotypes typical of any normal cell. Routine stains for leukocyte common antigen (LCA), T cell, and B cell markers are usually negative, with the exception of stains for the B cell marker PAX5, which is virtually always weakly positive in HRS cells; CD20, another B cell marker, can also be detected on subset of HRS cells in a significant minority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. CD15, the diagnostic marker that is most specific among lymphomas for classic HRS cells, is normally expressed on granulocytes. The other most useful diagnostic marker, CD30, is not lineage specific; with sensitive staining methods, expression of T cell markers may be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A clearer picture of the ontogeny of HRS cells has emerged from analysis of rearranged antigen receptor genes isolated from single cells. Within B lymphoid cells, the most lineage-specific molecular events involve rearrangement and mutation of the immunoglobulin genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most patients with nodular sclerosis HL, the most common classical HL subtype, have a clonal rearrangement of the V, D, and J segments of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain locus in the HRS cells, a feature characteristic of mature B lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Even more tellingly, sequence analysis of the rearranged VDJ regions has revealed a high load of somatic mutations, usually resulting in nonfunctional Ig variable regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/11,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16,17</a>]. Somatic hypermutation of Ig genes appears to be restricted normally to germinal center B cells within the follicles of secondary lymphoid organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], strongly suggesting that the HRS cells of classical HL usually arise from germinal center or post-germinal center B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1,16,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,17,19</a>].</p><p>Further evidence linking HRS cells to germinal center B cells comes from the evaluation of rare patients with both HL and a non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>] or chronic lymphocytic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In these patients, the HRS cells and the NHL cells are often clonally related, as evidenced by identical VDJ rearrangements of the Ig heavy chain locus and shared somatic mutations within the VDJ region. In addition, in such cases the HRS and NHL cells sometimes also accumulate unique somatic mutations in the rearranged VDJ Ig heavy chain locus that are absent from the other cell type. These findings suggest that the initial transforming event occurred in a germinal center B cell that was the precursor of both the NHL and HRS cells. This event must have been followed by acquisition of distinct sets of secondary molecular lesions that are responsible for the divergent phenotypes of the two diseases.</p><p>Some reports suggest that classic HRS cells can be of T cell origin, but such cases are rare. Even among cases where T cell markers are expressed on HRS cells, the tumor cells usually have clonal somatically mutated IgG rearrangements, a finding indicative of a B cell origin. The few cases (estimated to be 1 to 2 percent of classical HL) that have clonal rearrangements of T cell receptor genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] have not been shown to be clinically distinct, but the numbers available for analysis are very small.</p><p>Despite the clear genetic evidence of a germinal center B cell origin in most cases of classical HL, HRS cells characteristically lose the phenotypic features of germinal center B cells. Although in up to 33 percent of cases of classical HL the HRS cells express the B cell marker CD20 (which has been suggested on the basis of some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], but not other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], retrospective studies to be a marker of poorer outcome), most cases fail to express markers that define germinal center B cells, such as the transcriptional repressor BCL6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. HRS cells do not show evidence of ongoing somatic hypermutation of their immunoglobulin genes after the initial transforming event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and in fact usually fail to transcribe immunoglobulin gene RNAs.</p><p>The peculiar absence of immunoglobulin gene expression in HRS cells appears to be due to impaired function of immunoglobulin gene promoters and enhancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/16,17,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,27</a>], which stems from downregulation of B cell transcription factors such as OCT2, BOB-1, and PU.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], and acquisition of epigenetic changes that result in silencing of IgH promoters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Proteins that are involved in signaling downstream of the IgH receptor, such as BLNK, as well as other B cell specific genes, are also down-regulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Multiple mechanisms leading to this dramatic change in gene and protein expression pattern, which is fundamental to understanding how HRS cells are created, have been proposed: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Downregulation of early B cell factor 1 (EBF1), a major B cell transcription factor &ndash; Studies have shown that enforced expression of EBF1 in cHL cell lines leads to upregulation of several B cell markers, including CD19, CD79A, and CD79B, implying that downregulation of EBF1 in HRS contributes to the loss of B cell phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aberrant expression of master regulators of other hematopoietic cell lineages, such as NOTCH1 and Id2 &ndash; Activated B cell factor 1 (which is highly expressed in HRS) and Id2 antagonize the function of E2A and possibly PAX5 as well, providing another plausible reason for HRS cells to lose expression of B cell-specific genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Hypoxia-induced upregulation of Id2 and NOTCH1 in normal B cells and diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines of germinal center origin leads to increased JUN expression and enhanced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) activity, both characteristics of HRS cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. These findings suggest that transient hypoxic conditions may impose phenotypic changes in germinal center B cells, promoting their survival and initiating an epigenetic switch towards an HRS cell-like phenotype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive activation of the transcription factors STAT5A and STAT5B, which has also been implicated in the downregulation of B cell-specific genes in HRS cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF TUMORIGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One mechanism that is firmly linked to the growth and survival of classical <span class=\"nowrap\">Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg</span> (HRS) cells is activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) transcription factor-signaling pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. NF-kB encompasses a family of proteins consisting of homodimers and heterodimers of gene products related to the v-rel oncoprotein. NF-kB activation plays an important role in many normal immune responses, including those involving B cells, and has been implicated in many forms of human neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Most resting cells do not have nuclear NF-kB because one or more inhibitory proteins belonging to the I kappa B (IkB) family sequester NF-kB in the cytoplasm. However, a number of cellular stimuli lead to the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation of IkB, which permits NF-kB factors to travel to the nucleus and activate the transcription of target genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Two major types of NF-kB heterodimers are found in normal mature B cells, <span class=\"nowrap\">NF-kB1/c-REL</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">NF-kB1/REL-A</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Both the c-REL and REL-A heterodimers are sensitive to inhibition by IkBa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The few HRS cell lines derived from classical Hodgkin lymphomas (HLs) have elevated nuclear <span class=\"nowrap\">NF-kB1/c-REL</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">NF-kB1/REL-A</span> levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], a finding consistent with a general disturbance in the regulation of NF-kB activation. Despite the structural similarities of the various NF-kB family members, c-REL is unique in its ability to promote lymphocyte transformation, and its nuclear accumulation likely contributes to HRS cell transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first evidence for a role of NF-kB in HL came from the demonstration of constitutive NF-kB DNA binding activity in the nucleus in several HL cell lines and in primary HRS cells from one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This constitutive nuclear activity can both prevent apoptosis and promote cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. There are at least three mechanisms by which increased NF-kB activity might occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutation or loss of IkB or other negative regulators of NF-kB</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constitutive activity of kinases that target IkB for degradation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modification of NF-kB resulting in insensitivity to inhibition by IkB</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amplification of the REL oncogene (which encodes NF-kB) secondary to chromosomal gains involving the short arm of chromosome 2 </p><p/><p>A mutation of the IkB alpha (IkBa) gene has been documented in the HRS cells and cell lines from some patients with HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. In two cell lines, for example, one allele of IkBa was deleted and the other allele had a deletion or point mutation, resulting in a truncated IkBa protein lacking the C-terminus that is presumably not able to inhibit NF-kB DNA binding activity and prevent translocation into the nucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>These cell lines were established from treated patients late in the course of their disease. The next step was to determine if IkBa alterations were clonal events that could be identified in the HRS cells of untreated patients. In a total of 19 patients studied in three reports, five had truncating mutations of IkBa on at least one allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In one such patient, all HRS cells that were removed from a lymph node biopsy via micromanipulation contained two different mutant IkBa alleles, each resulting in truncation of the C-terminus of the protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In the majority of classical HLs, the HRS cells lack mutations of IkBa. Thus, most tumors apparently have wild-type IkBa alleles and express normal IkBa protein. Some HL cell lines have constitutive nuclear <span class=\"nowrap\">NF-kB1/relA</span> DNA binding complexes despite having wild-type IkBa alleles. This may be due, at least in part, to constitutive activity of IkB kinases, resulting in rapid degradation of IkBa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Cytokines secreted by these cell lines also may contribute by triggering NF-kB activation, a factor that may also be important in vivo, as discussed further below. In addition, the analysis of laser-microdissected HRS cells has detected loss of function mutations (ie, either deletions or frameshift mutations) in the TNFAIP3 gene in 70 percent of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negative classical HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This high rate of TNFAIP3 mutations in EBV negative classical HL was confirmed in a subsequent study performed on HRS cells that were purified by flow sorting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The TNFAIP3 protein (also known as A20) is a negative regulator of NF-kB that is also commonly involved by loss-of-function mutations in mediastinal B cell lymphoma, an entity with a number of molecular similarities to classical HL.</p><p>Another important contributor to NF-kB activation is EBV infection. EBV is present in the HRS cell in about 40 percent of cases of the lymphocyte-rich subtype; in about 70 percent of cases of mixed cellularity HL, which is more frequent in children and older adults; and an even higher fraction of the lymphocyte depletion subtype, which is most often seen in HIV+ patients. It is uncommon in the nodular sclerosis subtype. EBV+ HRS cells typically express the EBV gene LMP-1, which encodes a transmembrane protein that behaves like a constitutively active TNF receptor. LMP-1 activates NF-kB by promoting IkBa turnover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. A detailed discussion of the possible role of EBV in the pathogenesis of HL is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-epstein-barr-virus-in-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of Epstein-Barr virus in Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Three TNF family receptor-ligand pairs have the potential to activate NF-kB in HRS cells. CD40, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, is virtually always expressed on HRS cells; it may be engaged by CD40 ligand on the surrounding T and B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. CD40 activation of NF-kB is mediated by proteolysis of TNF receptor-associated factors; these factors appear to regulate <span class=\"nowrap\">CD40/NF-kB-mediated</span> control of the immune response in HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In addition, TNF produced by the HRS cell may act in an autocrine fashion via TNF receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], and CD30 on the HRS cell may be crosslinked by CD30 ligand on either the HRS cell or on surrounding cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Finally, some data suggest that overexpression of CD30 per se is sufficient to activate TRAF2 and TRAF5 dependent signals that lead to NF-kB activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Consequences of constitutive NF-kB activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gene expression analyses have shown that many NF-kB target genes appear to be highly expressed in primary HRS cells and HRS cell lines. As an example, NF-kB activates the IkBalpha gene, resulting in a negative feedback loop that reduces NF-kB signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. In the majority of patients with classical HL, 10 to 90 percent of the HRS cells express high levels of IkBalpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other NF-kB target genes expressed in HRS cells include intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-6, and TNF. Some of these cytokines may have effects on the surrounding non-neoplastic leukocytes that form the characteristic background of classical HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Another target of NF-kB that may promote HRS cell survival is DDR1, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is upregulated by LMP-1 expression. DDR1 is activated upon binding collagen, initiating signaling cascades that enhance resistance to apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-reed-sternberg-cell-and-the-pathogenesis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>These observations suggest that therapies aimed at the NF-kB system might be of benefit in patients with classical HL.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cellular origin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The growth and survival of classical HRS cells are closely tied to the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) transcription factor-signaling pathway. The constitutive nuclear activity of NF-kB can both prevent apoptosis and promote cell proliferation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is found in the tumor cells of a significant minority of cases, expresses viral proteins such as LMP1 that lead to NF-kB activation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Consequences of constitutive NF-kB activation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other pathways that appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of classical HL include the interleukin-13 signaling pathway, NOTCH signaling pathway, and interferon regulatory factors.

Many cases demonstrate amplification of genes, such as c-REL and JAK2, which contribute to the activation of NF-kB and STAT3.
