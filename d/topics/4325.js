Combined immunodeficiency syndromes are somewhat arbitrarily distinguished from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in that they do not characteristically lead to death from overwhelming infection in the first year of life. In addition, combined immunodeficiency syndromes frequently have associated clinical features.</p><p>Mutations of a particular gene may lead to SCID or to milder combined immunodeficiency, depending upon whether the gene defect is fully penetrant or on the functional consequences of the specific mutation: amorphic (complete defect) or hypomorphic (partial defect). Genetic defects in which the mutations primarily lead to a SCID phenotype are discussed separately.

Algorithms for evaluation of patients with suspected immunodeficiency are published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/combined-immunodeficiencies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. All patients suspected of having one of these disorders should be referred to an immunology specialist for evaluation and an attempt to determine a definitive diagnosis.

Examples include genes encoding acute phase proteins, adhesion molecules, and the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/combined-immunodeficiencies/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. NF-kappa-B also regulates development of other tissues such as skin, hair, and teeth.</p><p>The activity of NF-kappa-B is controlled by NF-kappa-B inhibitor proteins alpha and beta (NFKBIA and NFKBIB), also called the inhibitor of kappa B (I-kappa-B alpha and beta [IKBA and IKBB]). These inhibitors inactivate NF-kappa-B by trapping it in the cytoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/combined-immunodeficiencies/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. NF-kappa-B is active when the inhibitor is degraded after phosphorylation by IKK. IKK is a heterotrimer of alpha, beta, and gamma chains. Mutations in NFKBI or IKK lead to decreased NF-kappa-B activity.</p><p>The IKK beta chain (IKBKB, IKK-beta, or IKK2) is encoded on chromosome 8p11.21 (MIM *603258). The IKK gamma chain (IKBKG, IKK-gamma, or IKK3, also called NF-kappa-B essential modifier [NEMO], MIM *300248) is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome. The NFKBIA (also called I-kappa-B alpha or IKBA, MIM #164008) is encoded on chromosome 14q13.

Combined immunodeficiency syndromes are somewhat arbitrarily distinguished from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in that they do not characteristically lead to death from overwhelming infection in the first year of life.

However, patients with milder defects may not present until later in childhood or even early adulthood. Many of the combined immunodeficiency syndromes have characteristic-associated clinical features that suggest a particular defect and help direct the diagnostic evaluation.
