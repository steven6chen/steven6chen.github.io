This includes pharmacokinetic properties, propensity for drug-drug interactions, and side effect profiles and toxicities. </p><p>Over the past several decades, the number of available antiseizure drugs has more than doubled. Unlike some of the earliest antiseizure drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> (CBZ), many of the currently available antiseizure drugs have simple pharmacokinetics and more limited effects on liver metabolism. This translates into a generally lower rate of side effects, reduced need for serum monitoring, once- or twice-daily dosing for some, and fewer drug-drug interactions. Despite these advantages, however, there are few data to suggest significant differences in effectiveness among available antiseizure drugs. </p><p>Antiseizure drugs are typically grouped by their principal mode of action, although for many drugs, the precise mechanism of action is not known or multiple actions are suspected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71274 \">table 1</a>). To some degree, the cellular effects of antiseizure drugs are linked with the types of seizures against which they are most effective. An improved understanding of the molecular effects of existing antiseizure drugs as well as development of new antiseizure drugs that act against novel targets may allow for more rational polytherapy in the future. </p><p>For detailed prescribing information, readers should refer to the individual drug information topics within UpToDate. Comprehensive information on drug-drug interactions can be determined using the drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact online). This tool can be accessed from the UpToDate online search page or through the individual drug information topics in the section on Drug interactions.

It is also effective for the treatment of affective illnesses such as bipolar disorder and chronic pain syndromes such as trigeminal neuralgia.</p><p>CBZ binds to voltage-dependent sodium channels, probably after they change from the activated to the inactivated state. This binding extends the inactivated phase and inhibits the generation of rapid action potentials when the cell is experiencing incoming depolarizing trains. This effect increases with the rate of neuronal firing.</p><p>CBZ is approximately 70 percent protein bound. It is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and is a potent and broad-spectrum inducer of the CYP system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60182 \">table 2</a>). The main metabolite, CBZ 10,11-epoxide, has anticonvulsant activity and can be measured in the serum. </p><p>Screening for the HLA-B*1502 allele is recommended prior to starting CBZ in patients with Asian ancestry due to the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). (See <a href=\"#H30597917\" class=\"local\">'Role of HLA testing'</a> below.)</p><p>The usual initial starting dose is 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day orally given two, three, or four times daily; the dose is increased every five days to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily. Generally, three-times-daily dosing of the immediate-release formulation is recommended. However, if patients experience side effects two to four hours after a dose, then the total daily dose could be redistributed over four doses or a switch made to an extended-release formulation. An intravenous (IV) preparation was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is intended for use as short-term replacement therapy in patients on stable oral doses of CBZ. The recommended IV conversion dose is 70 percent of the total daily oral dose, divided into four equal doses and given every six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Extended-release oral formulations allow for twice-daily dosing with more stable blood levels. A systematic review of 10 randomized trials comparing immediate-release with controlled-release CBZ found a trend toward improved tolerability for controlled-release CBZ but mixed results on seizure control, with most trials showing no significant difference between the two formulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Serum CBZ levels should be measured initially at three, six, and nine weeks, with a goal level of 4 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> (17 to 51 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. Frequent levels are needed early in therapy due to autoinduction, which results in decreased serum concentrations. Further increases up to 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day may be necessary after two to three months because of CYP autoinduction. Serum levels subsequently should be checked at least every two months until successive determinations are constant, more frequently if CBZ doses or concomitant antiseizure drug doses are changed. </p><p>A number of drugs can influence the serum concentration of CBZ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80801\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80801 \">table 3A</a>). CBZ may reduce the effectiveness of most forms of hormonal contraception (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54244\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54244 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Contraception'</a>.) </p><p>Common systemic side effects of CBZ include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hyponatremia, rash, pruritus, and fluid retention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59755%7ENEURO%2F78896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59755 graphicRef78896 \">table 5A-B</a>). Patients who develop a rash with CBZ are more likely to develop one with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxcarbazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> (LTG), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, and vice versa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Men taking CBZ have higher rates of sexual dysfunction and low testosterone levels, which may be reversible if CBZ is withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H178095363\" class=\"local\">'Hyponatremia'</a> below.)</p><p>Other potentially life-threatening adverse events related to CBZ include SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (see <a href=\"#H30597917\" class=\"local\">'Role of HLA testing'</a> below) and bone marrow suppression.</p><p>Leukopenia occurs in approximately 12 percent of children and 7 percent of adults with CBZ treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It may be transient or persistent and does not usually require immediate discontinuation of CBZ therapy. The onset is typically within the first three months of treatment. Patients who have a low or low-normal white blood cell (WBC) or neutrophil count before CBZ treatment may be at higher risk for developing CBZ-induced leukopenia or neutropenia.</p><p>Aplastic anemia (pancytopenia) is a rare, idiosyncratic, nondose-related side effect that is most likely to occur within the first three or four months after initiating CBZ therapy. Daily laboratory checks would be necessary to monitor for aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia because of their rapid onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and such frequent monitoring is neither practical nor necessary for most patients taking CBZ. A more suitable approach is to monitor for aplastic anemia by informing patients and clinicians to carefully watch for signs and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

WBC counts less than <span class=\"nowrap\">3000/microL</span> or neutrophil counts below <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL</span> warrant either a decrease in CBZ dose with frequent WBC monitoring, or CBZ discontinuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30597917\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of HLA testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBZ has been associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span>.

The GABA(A) receptor complex has binding sites for GABA, benzodiazepines, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>. Picrotoxin and other similar proconvulsants bind to the GABA(A) receptor and block chloride channels, thereby preventing postsynaptic inhibition. Thus, reduced GABAergic tone is viewed as proconvulsant, while increasing GABAergic tone generally has an anticonvulsant effect.</p><p>Synthesis of GABA is dependent upon the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), which requires pyridoxine as a coenzyme. Pyridoxine-deficient infants lack the capacity to synthesize GABA normally and are prone to seizures. The metabolism of GABA to succinate occurs in presynaptic neurons and glia by means of the mitochondrial enzyme GABA transaminase (GABA-T).</p><p>Over time, several antiseizure drugs have been designed to increase the supply of GABA by lowering GABA metabolism by GABA-T, reducing the reuptake of GABA into neurons and glia, or increasing the production of GABA by GAD.

It binds to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels and modulates calcium currents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects/abstract/324,325\" class=\"abstract_t\">324,325</a>]. Pregabalin also modulates the release of several neurotransmitters including glutamate, noradrenaline, and substance P.

Pregabalin does not induce or inhibit the CYP system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60182 \">table 2</a>). In addition, it does not bind to plasma proteins.

Other side effects include weight gain, peripheral edema, blurred or double vision, asthenia, tremor, and abnormal thinking (most often impaired concentration).
