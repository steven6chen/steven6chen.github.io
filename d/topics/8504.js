They are also administered to prevent late-phase anaphylactic reactions. However, injected, infused, or orally administered systemic glucocorticoids have been associated with immediate hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of hypersensitivity reactions to systemic glucocorticoids. Topical corticosteroids, usually in the form of skin preparations or inhaled glucocorticoids, can cause contact hypersensitivity, which is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids#H100383861\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Contact hypersensitivity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7948528\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypersensitivity reactions to systemic glucocorticoids are rare, although the exact incidence is unknown. These reactions appear to occur in &ge;0.1 percent of parenteral administrations, as demonstrated in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An early report in the 1950s described 6700 glucocorticoid injections given to 2256 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There were 20 instances of urticaria (including reactions localized to the injection site) or bronchospasm (0.29 percent of injections and 0.89 percent of patients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study involving 202 children with rheumatologic diseases, approximately 0.1 percent of 10,000 doses of glucocorticoids administered were thought to cause reactions that were possibly of an allergic nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Symptoms included pruritus, hives, and anaphylactic-like reactions. There was no statistical difference with respect to the ethnicity or underlying rheumatologic condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Voluntary reporting of adverse drug reactions to the national Swiss Drug Monitoring Center uncovered 14 cases of suspected hypersensitivity reactions after parenteral glucocorticoid administration in approximately 5 million inhabitants over 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, data based on voluntary reporting generally underestimates the true incidence of an adverse event.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7948535\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reliable data about whether patients with specific diseases are at greater risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral glucocorticoids are lacking. Although some reports suggested that renal transplant or asthmatic patients (especially those who are aspirin-sensitive) may be at higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>], this could be attributable to the frequent use of these medications and not to the disease itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the author's series, five patients received the offending drug for asthma, four for rheumatologic conditions, three for poison ivy, two for orthopedic conditions, and one for the treatment of an allergic reaction on one occasion and asthma on another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The manner in which patients become sensitized to glucocorticoids is not clear. Many of the patients in the author's study had not received extensive systemic (oral, intra-articular, or intravenous) glucocorticoid therapy before developing an allergic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In other studies, some patients had prior systemic exposure to the same or different glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>], while others did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The role of topical corticosteroid administration in sensitizing these patients has not been evaluated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7948775\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The allergenic moiety in glucocorticoids that is responsible for immediate reactions has not been determined. It could be part of the native molecule or a metabolite that acts as a hapten and binds to serum proteins, creating an allergenic complex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10714197\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypersensitivity (or allergic) reactions to drugs are mediated by cells of the immune system. Hypersensitivity reactions may be categorized based upon the time required for the first signs or symptoms to appear after an administered dose. Immediate reactions usually begin within one hour of administration, and delayed reactions begin after one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This classification system is intended to distinguish immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions, which are most often immediate, from other types. A minority of IgE-mediated reactions appear after one hour, particularly after oral administration of a drug or if the drug is taken with food, although this categorization system identifies the majority of IgE-mediated reactions. It is important to distinguish IgE-mediated reactions because they carry the risk of anaphylaxis if the patient is re-exposed. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to glucocorticoids are the focus of this review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19478802\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity to glucocorticoids include pruritus, rash, hives, angioedema, sneezing, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> dyspnea, throat tightness, <span class=\"nowrap\">wheezing/bronchospasm,</span> hypotension, and anaphylactic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/9-14,16-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14,16-27</a>]. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following intravenous, intramuscular, oral, intra-articular, epidural, and topical administration.</p><p>The largest available series on immediate hypersensitivity reactions to systemic corticosteroids consisted of 15 patients (with a total of 19 reactions) who were evaluated with allergy testing at the author's center. These individuals presented over a 12-year period, although each patient was studied within one year of the inciting reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. All reported various combinations of the signs and symptoms listed above, ranging in severity from pruritic rash (three patients) to anaphylaxis (five patients).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13525284\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed recognition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not uncommon for patients to have had more than one reaction before the possibility of allergy to glucocorticoids is considered. Recognition of these reactions is complicated by several factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients typically receive glucocorticoids for conditions, such as status asthmaticus, anaphylaxis, or shock, which have signs and symptoms similar to those of allergic reactions. In such settings, it can be difficult to distinguish a progressively worsening medical condition from a superimposed allergic reaction to a glucocorticoid. Reactions to glucocorticoids can also be mistaken for biphasic anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biphasic and protracted anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids may be given together with other medications that are more commonly implicated in allergic reactions, such as antibiotics or opioids. Even H1 and H2 antihistamines can cause rare allergic reactions. (See <a href=\"#H375399403\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians may not be aware that it is even possible to become allergic to glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19479067\"><span class=\"h3\">Causative drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The likelihood of a specific glucocorticoid causing hypersensitivity appears to be related to the frequency with which it is used. Some papers noted that the incidence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> allergy seemed higher than allergy to other glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/9,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,27</a>]. However, in the series by the author's group, approximately one-half of reactions were caused by oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, which are commonly used for outpatient therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Reactions to hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone accounted for 5 and 21 percent, respectively. Twenty percent of patients had a clinical reaction to more than one glucocorticoid. In a review of the English medical literature from 2004 to 2014, 120 immediate hypersensitivity reactions to glucocorticoids were reported in 106 patients (ages 2 to 90: 55 males, 51 females) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Of these patients, 63 percent had anaphylaxis, 27 percent had urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema, 6 percent had bronchospasm and dyspnea, and 6 percent had unspecified rash. Methylprednisolone was the glucocorticoid most often implicated in anaphylaxis (41 percent) followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetate (19 percent). Considering all types of reactions, methylprednisolone accounted for 41 percent, prednisolone for 20 percent, and triamcinolone for 14 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19478809\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed reactions to systemic glucocorticoids include delayed urticarial reactions and maculopapular exanthema. These reactions are uncommon and have been attributed to a T cell-mediated response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Delayed reactions to systemic glucocorticoids are not discussed further in this review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1363067\"><span class=\"h1\">CROSS-REACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patterns of cross-reactivity among different drugs are not defined, although several patients with allergic reactions to more than one systemically administered glucocorticoid have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/9,10,27,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,27,30</a>]. Therefore, without an allergy evaluation or challenge procedure, it is not possible to choose a &quot;safe&quot; alternative glucocorticoid empirically for a patient who has had an immediate reaction to a specific agent. Various studies have tried to analyze the literature or small series for patterns of cross-reactivity without firm conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/9,10,16,18,21,23,27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,16,18,21,23,27,31</a>]. Some papers suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> cross-reacts more with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> than with a halogenated steroid, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27</a>]. In the 15-patient series, no patterns of cross-reactivity were apparent based upon the clinical history of allergic reactions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the results of the skin testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In the case of contact hypersensitivity to topical corticosteroids, at least two theories for predicting cross-reactivity among drugs have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. However, it is not clear that these theories, which concern T cell cross-sensitivity, have any utility in predicting potentially antibody-mediated reactions when glucocorticoids are given systemically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1362890\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with signs or symptoms of an immediate reaction to a systemic glucocorticoid should be referred to an allergy specialist whenever possible and advised to avoid systemic use of all glucocorticoids until evaluated. It is impractical to recommend indefinite avoidance of systemic glucocorticoids because of the widespread use of these agents for so many different disorders. If referral is not possible, then the patient could receive a different agent from the one that caused the original reaction using a graded challenge procedure under close medical supervision. (See <a href=\"#H10714229\" class=\"local\">'Graded drug challenge'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10714213\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction to a systemic glucocorticoid is based upon clinical history, physical examination (if the patient is evaluated during the reaction), and when possible, skin testing with the culprit drug and possible alternatives. In many cases, a challenge procedure is needed to identify an alternative glucocorticoid that the patient can safely take in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19478944\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate-type skin testing is recommended in patients with reactions that are consistent with immediate hypersensitivity. (See <a href=\"#H19478802\" class=\"local\">'Immediate reactions'</a> above.)</p><p>Skin testing requires training and knowledge to perform and interpret safely and correctly and should be done by an allergy specialist whenever possible. Skin testing with glucocorticoids is useful, although it is not validated, and the sensitivity and specificity are not well-defined.</p><p>Skin prick testing using the prick-puncture technique is suggested initially. In the author's series, we performed skin prick testing using a full-strength solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Testing performed on three healthy volunteers was negative.</p><p>Positive (histamine) and negative (normal saline) controls should always be included. Preservative-free glucocorticoid solutions are recommended whenever possible.</p><p>If the results of skin prick testing are negative and if the glucocorticoid is available in an injectable form (preservative-free if possible), intradermal testing is then performed. For intradermal testing, we used dilutions of 1:1000, followed if negative by 1:100, followed if negative by 1:10, and finally a full-strength solution of the drug. Other studies have used a dilution up to 1:10 for intradermal testing, although the full-strength solution for some glucocorticoids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a>, was four times higher than the products we used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A general discussion of the technique of allergy skin testing is reviewed in more detail elsewhere.

This very limited data suggested that basophil activation tests may be useful as a tool for diagnosis of IgE-mediated reactions to glucocorticoids, although we do not use them. Basophil activation assays are considered investigational in the United States, and the technical difficulties of manipulating basophils are reviewed elsewhere.

This is also called test dosing or drug provocation testing. Challenges are used when the sensitivity of allergy tests for evaluating reactions to certain drugs is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In most cases, graded challenges are performed with a drug to which the patient has <strong>not</strong> reacted and is believed likely to tolerate.</p><p>We use graded challenges to confirm that a patient tolerates an alternative glucocorticoid (other than the one implicated in the reaction) to which skin testing was negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Graded challenge does <strong>not</strong> modify the allergic response to the drug or prevent recurrent reactions. Therefore:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who tolerate a drug upon graded challenge prove that they are not allergic to it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A challenge procedure in a patient with a suspected IgE-mediated drug allergy could potentially induce anaphylaxis and should be performed by an allergy expert when possible and in a setting equipped to manage possible reactions.</p><p/><p>At the author's center, challenges are performed starting with <span class=\"nowrap\">1/100<sup>th</sup></span> of the therapeutic dose, followed if tolerated 30 minutes later by <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10<sup>th</sup></span> of the dose, followed 30 minutes later if tolerated by <span class=\"nowrap\">9/10<sup>th</sup></span> of the dose. Patients are then observed for two hours. In the 15-patient series, 90 percent of subjects who had a negative skin prick test and a negative intradermal test (when the formulation is available in injectable form for intradermal testing) tolerated the glucocorticoid when a challenge was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1362907\"><span class=\"h2\">Desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug desensitization is a procedure which <strong>temporarily</strong> alters the clinical sensitivity to the medication and results in short-term tolerance, allowing the patient with immediate allergy to receive an uninterrupted course of the medication safely. Drug desensitization renders mast cells unresponsive to the drug in question, although the exact immunologic mechanism is not understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-systemic-glucocorticoids/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Drug desensitization is effective as long as the patient is receiving the drug, although the patient's sensitivity returns shortly after the drug is cleared from the body. Therefore, desensitization must be repeated every time the patient requires a course of the glucocorticoid. Desensitization is reviewed briefly here and in greater detail separately.

At the author's center, it is a common practice to perform drug desensitization rather than a challenge in patients with a positive skin test, even if the patient never received the drug in question.

Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported following intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, and oral administration.

Patterns of cross-reactivity are not well-defined, and in the absence of an allergy evaluation or a challenge procedure, it is not possible to choose a safe alternative agent empirically.

It is impractical to recommend indefinite avoidance of systemic glucocorticoids because of the widespread use of these agents for so many different disorders. If referral is not possible, then the issue can be deferred until systemic glucocorticoids are medically necessary, at which point the patient could receive a different agent from the one that caused the original reaction, using a graded challenge procedure under close medical supervision. (See <a href=\"#H1362890\" class=\"local\">'Referral'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10714229\" class=\"local\">'Graded drug challenge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction to a systemic glucocorticoid is based upon clinical history, physical examination (if the patient is evaluated during the reaction), and when possible, skin testing with the culprit drug and possible alternatives. In many cases, a challenge procedure is needed to identify an alternative glucocorticoid that the patient can safely take in the future. (See <a href=\"#H10714213\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing with glucocorticoids is not validated, and the sensitivity and specificity are not well-defined. Despite these limitations, positive results are useful in confirming reactivity to the culprit drug, and in patients with a positive skin test to a specific agent, negative results to other glucocorticoids are helpful in identifying an alternative agent that is then administered using a graded challenge.
