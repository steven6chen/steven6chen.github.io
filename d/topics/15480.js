The most prevalent form of SAD is winter depression, marked by recurrent episodes of unipolar depression that begin in the fall or winter and, if left untreated, generally remit in the following spring or summer. Recognizing the disorder is important because SAD is common and associated with psychosocial impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, acute treatment is often effective and maintenance treatment can prevent future episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among patients who were recruited for randomized trials studying treatment of winter depression, nearly 60 percent had never been treated for depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, and validity of SAD; most of the topic is devoted to recurrent unipolar major depression with winter seasonal pattern (winter depression). Choosing treatment is reviewed separately.

Some authorities think that seasonality is distributed along a continuum of severity and that SAD represents one end of the continuum, whereas others conceptualize SAD as a categorical diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Although seasonality may occur widely in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>], it appears that for most individuals in the community, and many patients with mood disorders, the effect of seasonality is modest at most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. However, seasonal variation in mood and behavior may be greater in patients with depressive syndromes than healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>In addition, placebo response rates in patients with depression may vary in different seasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A study examined patients with depressive syndromes (n = 432) who were not selected for seasonality and who received a 10-day course of placebo as a &ldquo;washout&rdquo; or lead-in to a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Response to placebo occurred in fewer patients during the late fall and winter months than the rest of year (15 versus 25 percent). &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4787649\"><span class=\"h2\">General population</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In studies from Canada, the United States, and Wales that used interviews rather than self-report questionnaires and used standardized diagnostic criteria for major depression with seasonal pattern, the lifetime prevalence of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in the general population was approximately 0.5 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].

However, this finding may be due to methodologic problems. As an example, a nationally representative survey using more rigorous methods (interviews and standardized diagnostic criteria) found that the lifetime prevalence of SAD was greater in men than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The finding that SAD is more common among women in clinical studies may be due to selection bias, and simply reflect the observation that the prevalence of unipolar major depression in general is greater in women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and neurobiology&quot;, section on 'Prevalence'</a>.) </p><p>The prevalence of SAD in different age groups is not clear, but seems to be greater in adults than either older adults or children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>]. Onset of SAD is usually between age 20 and 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Individuals residing at higher northern latitudes, which receive less light in winter, may be at increased risk for SAD; however, this is controversial. Some studies have found that the prevalence of SAD was greater in higher latitudes, but case finding relied upon screening instruments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Methodologically more rigorous studies using standardized criteria to diagnose SAD found that latitude was not associated with the prevalence of SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is not known; the primary hypotheses involve disturbances of circadian rhythms, decreased sensitivity of the retina, genetic factors, and dysregulation of neurotransmitters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>In one model, the pathogenesis of SAD includes two components: a seasonal factor and a depression factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Different pathophysiologic mechanisms may underlie each factor. As an example, the seasonal factor may be due to phase delayed circadian rhythms and the depression factor may be due to monoamine (eg, serotonin) dysregulation. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Circadian rhythms</strong> &ndash; Circadian (daily) rhythms are physiologic and behavioral changes that oscillate over a 24-hour cycle, primarily in response to light and darkness in the environment. It is hypothesized that the genesis of SAD involves changes in circadian rhythms due to seasonal changes in the length of daylight each day (also referred to as the light-dark cycle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. The circadian rhythms affect the timing and duration of sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Two hypotheses based upon circadian rhythms have been proposed for the pathogenesis of SAD: the photoperiod hypothesis and the phase shift hypothesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Photoperiod hypothesis</strong> &ndash; The length of natural daylight each day is called photoperiod, and is shorter in winter and longer in summer. The photoperiod hypothesis of SAD proposes that in vulnerable individuals, the shorter photoperiod in winter induces depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Active secretion of melatonin occurs at night, and the longer duration of melatonin secretion in winter may trigger depression. A study found that in patients with SAD (winter depression; n = 55), the duration of nocturnal melatonin secretion was longer in winter than summer; among the healthy controls (n = 55), the duration of melatonin secretion was similar in winter and summer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These results suggest that patients with SAD respond to photoperiod in a manner analogous to other mammals, who respond to the shorter photoperiod of winter (and longer duration of melatonin secretion) with a hibernation response. The hypersomnia, increased appetite, and weight gain that characterize winter depression in patients with SAD may be viewed as a type of hibernation response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Other evidence supporting the photoperiod model of SAD comes from studies of light therapy, which suggest that artificial light may extend the photoperiod. Additional information about melatonin is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-and-available-preparations-of-melatonin#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology and available preparations of melatonin&quot;, section on 'Melatonin physiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Phase shift hypothesis</strong> &ndash; The phase shift hypothesis proposes that there is an optimal relationship between the timing of circadian rhythms (eg, the body&rsquo;s minimum temperature and secretion of melatonin) and the timing of sleep, and that misalignment between circadian rhythms and sleep leads to SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/33,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,38</a>]. In most patients with SAD, the later dawn in winter and diminished light delays circadian rhythms relative to external clock time and sleep; this shift of circadian rhythms to a later time is called phase delay. These patients respond to artificial morning light that realigns the circadian rhythms with the sleep-wake cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Among a smaller group of patients with SAD, circadian rhythms shift to an earlier time with respect to sleep (phase advance); these patients may respond to evening light [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/33,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,38</a>]. Properly timed doses of melatonin may also correct circadian misalignment and relieve SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus is often referred to as the master biological clock or pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,42</a>]. This nucleus generates and synchronizes (entrains) internal circadian rhythms with external time cues such as light, and helps control multiple circadian rhythms, such as daily fluctuations in core body temperature, as well as melatonin secretion by the pineal gland. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Bright light can shift the timing of circadian rhythms. Light just before the temperature minimum will typically shift the temperature minimum clockwise to a later time (phase delay). Light soon after the temperature minimum will shift the temperature minimum counterclockwise to an earlier time (phase advance). The timing of the light relative to the temperature minimum will determine how much the circadian rhythms shift. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Darkness generally has the opposite effect of light upon circadian rhythms. Darkness in the morning will cause a phase delay in the rhythms; darkness in the evening will cause a phase advance in the rhythms. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Retinal subsensitivity</strong> &ndash; The sensitivity of the retina normally increases during winter in response to decreased light levels; the retinal subsensitivity hypothesis posits that this response is impaired in SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Retinal ganglion cells, which contain a photopigment (melanopsin) that is involved in circadian entrainment, are connected to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The diminished retinal sensitivity to light may thus affect circadian function. The prevalence of SAD appears to be greater among individuals with severe visual impairment, compared with individual with full sight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, observational studies indicate that bright light therapy can normalize retinal sensitivity anomalies in patients with SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetics</strong> &ndash; There have not been any twin studies of SAD and it is not known if SAD has a heritable component. One study found that a missense variant of the melanopsin gene was associated with an increased risk of SAD, but the variant was seen in only 5 percent of patients with SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Other studies have found that SAD is associated with variants of specific genes involved in synthesis of dopamine, guanyl-nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), and serotonin, but none of these results have been consistently replicated across different studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In family history studies, a family history of mood disorders is present in 25 to 67 percent of patients with SAD, and approximately 15 percent of patients with SAD have a first degree relative with SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although these rates exceed what is found in the general population, a positive family history may be due to environmental effects, genetic factors, or both.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Twin studies have examined seasonality, which represents seasonal changes in mood and behavior that are less severe than what occur in SAD. These studies suggest that genetic factors account for approximately 30 percent or more of the phenotypic variance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The activity of many genes appears to vary in different seasons. A study of more than 22,000 genes from volunteers (n &gt;1200) found that seasonal variation in gene expression occurred in nearly 25 percent of the genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Approximately 2300 genes were more active in summer and 2800 were more active in winter. Seasonal variation in gene expression was observed in 9 of the 16 clock genes tested. As an example, the circadian clock gene ARNTL was 50 percent more active in August than February. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serotonin</strong> &ndash; Multiple studies suggest that abnormal functioning of serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system may be involved in SAD:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased serotonergic activity may occur in SAD because of hyperfunctional activity of the serotonin transporter; this enhanced activity may increase clearance of serotonin from the synaptic cleft and reduce synaptic serotonin concentrations. A study observed that activity of the serotonin transporter was elevated in patients with winter depression compared with healthy controls; in addition, the enhanced activity of the transporter in patients normalized after bright light therapy and during natural summer remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased levels of the serotonin transporter protein (which are associated with lower synaptic serotonin levels) may also decrease central serotonergic activity in SAD. A study that examined healthy volunteers found that levels of the protein in the brain were greater during the fall and winter, compared with the spring and summer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A crossover study compared an amino acid beverage containing tryptophan with an amino acid beverage containing no tryptophan in patients with SAD (n = 11) who were in remission during the summer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Tryptophan is the precursor amino acid required for central synthesis of serotonin, and administration of a large amount of amino acids without tryptophan induces hepatic metabolism that transiently depletes tryptophan and reduces brain serotonin. The patients served as their own controls and were randomly assigned to the order in which they received the two beverages; the oral solutions were administered approximately one week apart. Relapse of depression occurred more often during active tryptophan depletion than sham depletion (8 versus 0 patients [73 versus 0 percent]). Other crossover trials have similarly found that tryptophan depletion increased depressive symptoms in patients with SAD who had remitted after bright light therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, dysregulation of neurotransmitters other than serotonin may be involved in SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Information about neurotransmitters in the general population of patients with unipolar depression is discussed separately.

Among patients with SAD, it is estimated that bipolar I or II disorder is the underlying condition in no more than 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

SAD is thought to be a valid clinical syndrome, based upon its face validity (extent to which experts think the concept is distinct), descriptive validity (extent to which the defining characteristics of the illness are unique to the disease), predictive validity (extent to which one can predict the course of illness and response to treatment), and construct validity (extent to which the defining characteristics, boundaries, and pathophysiology of a disorder are known) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Evidence supporting the syndromal validity of SAD includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestation of winter depression is distinct and predictable, such that patients regularly present with depression in the fall or winter and remit in the spring or summer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

As an example, studies of patients with SAD have observed seasonal changes in melatonin secretion and found that processing of visual light is impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p>Nevertheless, some clinicians doubt that SAD is a valid syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,81</a>]. Arguments put forth that SAD is not a distinct entity include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SAD symptoms (eg, hyperphagia and hypersomnia) overlap with symptoms of major depression with atypical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. However, this argument is undermined by lack of overlap with regard to other atypical symptoms (see <a href=\"#H1629525\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above). In addition, an observational study found that bright light therapy was more effective for SAD than atypical depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The boundary between SAD and the seasonal variations in mood and behavior found in the general population (called seasonality) is not clearly delineated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. When the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire is administered to the general population, the histogram of the frequencies of each score does not have a bimodal distribution; instead, there is a continuum of the frequencies ranging from no seasonality to mild seasonality to SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

It is not considered a separate mood disorder; rather, SAD is a subtype of the following mood disorders: unipolar major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar II disorder. (See <a href=\"#H90018580\" class=\"local\">'Seasonal affective disorder'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated lifetime prevalence of SAD in the general population is approximately 0.5 to 3 percent. The point prevalence in primary care outpatients is approximately 5 to 10 percent, and in depressed outpatients is 15 percent. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of SAD is not known; the primary hypotheses involve disturbances of circadian rhythms, decreased sensitivity of the retina, genetic factors, and dysregulation of neurotransmitters. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two specific patterns of recurrent unipolar major depression with seasonal pattern have been described. Fall-winter onset SAD (winter depression) begins in the fall to early winter and, if left untreated, generally remits during the following spring and summer. Spring-summer onset SAD (summer depression) begins in the spring or summer and remits during the following fall and winter. Winter depression is far more common than summer depression. (See <a href=\"#H1629483\" class=\"local\">'Seasonal pattern'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms of major depression in patients with fall-winter onset SAD and in patients with nonseasonal major depression are the same, and include depressed mood, loss of pleasure or interest, change in appetite or weight, sleep disturbance, loss of energy, neurocognitive dysfunction, psychomotor agitation or retardation, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and suicidal ideation or behavior (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>). However, major depressive episodes in patients with SAD usually include atypical features, such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia (especially carbohydrates), and weight gain. (See <a href=\"#H1629525\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The seasonal pattern of recurrent unipolar major depression is generally not a long-term phenomenon. Among patients who are initially diagnosed with fall-winter onset SAD and subsequently evaluated (eg, 5 to 11 years later), recurrent depression with seasonal pattern persists in less than 50 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1629673\" class=\"local\">'Course of illness'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with unipolar major depression and a possible diagnosis of fall-winter onset SAD are assessed for recurrent depressive episodes with a seasonal pattern. The interview includes the following questions: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do you feel worst (more sad) in the winter?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do you eat more in the winter?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do you gain weight in the winter?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do you sleep more in the winter?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do you have less energy in the winter?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do you socialize with other people less often in the winter?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the depression ameliorated by sunnier weather?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Does the depression resolve during travel to a sunnier location or a location with a longer photoperiod?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Does the depression remit during the spring <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> summer?</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"#H203100283\" class=\"local\">'Seasonal pattern'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of SAD requires that patients meet criteria for a recurrent mood disorder with seasonal pattern. In patients who have recurrent unipolar major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>) with a fall-winter onset seasonal pattern, each of the following is present:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There is a regular temporal relationship between the onset of major depressive episodes and a particular time of year (fall or winter).
