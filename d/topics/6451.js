The cutaneous phenotype can result from altered activity of one of two enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, either a deficiency of ferrochelatase (FECH), which causes EPP; or a gain-of-function mutation of the erythroid-specific form of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS2), which causes X-linked protoporphyria (XLP). An acquired, adult-onset form of EPP has also been described, in which a clone of cells with mutated <em>FECH</em> expands in the setting of a myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndrome.

Most often, an allele with a severe <em>FECH</em> mutation is paired with a common low-expression variant allele (also called a hypomorphic variant), which itself has no phenotype. Many severe loss-of-function <em>FECH</em> mutations have been described, including missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations and deletions that lead to absent or substantially reduced enzyme activity. FECH deficiency impairs the formation of zinc protoporphyrin as well as heme synthesis in bone marrow red blood cell precursors (erythroblasts and reticulocytes); as a result, protoporphyrin accumulates mostly in its metal-free form in EPP.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common molecular basis for EPP is compound heterozygosity for a severe <em>FECH</em> mutation inherited from one parent and a hypomorphic mutation, <span class=\"nowrap\">IVS3-48T/C,</span> inherited from the other parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">IVS3-48T/C</span> variant results in increased use of an aberrant splice site and production of an mRNA that is more prone to degradation, leading to a decreased amount of FECH enzyme. This allele is estimated to occur in approximately 10 percent of the Caucasian population; it is more common in Japan and China, and very rare in Africans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].

Before the discovery of the <span class=\"nowrap\">IVS3-48T/C</span> hypomorphic <em>FECH</em> variant, inheritance of EPP was generally described as autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. This erroneous designation occurred because severe <em>FECH</em> mutations had been identified, but the common hypomorphic <em>FECH</em> variant had not yet been discovered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4967894\"><span class=\"h3\">XLP due to ALAS2 gain-of-function mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>XLP was recognized when some families with an EPP phenotype were noted to lack <em>FECH </em>mutations, to have a higher concentration of zinc protoporphyrin in their erythrocytes relative to patients with EPP due to <em>FECH</em> mutations, and to have an X-linked inheritance pattern. These observations led to the identification of a mutation in the only heme biosynthetic gene located on the X chromosome, the erythroid form of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (<em>ALAS2</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These families were classified as having XLP, also called X-linked EPP (XLEPP).</p><p>ALAS is the initial enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a>), and <em>ALAS2</em> mutations responsible for XLP cause C-terminal deletions that lead to enzymatic gain of function. ALA and downstream heme pathway intermediates are overproduced. The resulting excess protoporphyrin in bone marrow erythroblasts and reticulocytes greatly exceeds the amount needed for heme synthesis, and because <em>FECH</em> is not deficient, more of the excess protoporphyrin is liganded with zinc than in EPP. (See <a href=\"#H8738170\" class=\"local\">'Erythrocyte protoporphyrin'</a> below.)</p><p><em>ALAS2</em> is transcribed only in bone marrow erythroblasts. In contrast to the gain-of-function mutations in XLP, loss-of-function mutations of <em>ALAS2</em> have been described in cases of sex-linked sideroblastic anemia. A ubiquitous (housekeeping) form of ALAS (<em>ALAS1</em>) is transcribed in all tissues including the liver. Naturally occurring mutations of <em>ALAS1</em> have not been described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4967946\"><span class=\"h2\">Protoporphyrin accumulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The FECH enzyme exists as a homodimer in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is essential for the final step of heme formation, which is the insertion of iron into the protoporphyrin IX ring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57890 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Insufficient FECH activity results in excessive accumulation of protoporphyrin that lacks iron or other metals, particularly zinc (ie, metal-free protoporphyrin). The primary source of the excess plasma and erythrocyte protoporphyrin in EPP is metal-free protoporphyrin produced by bone marrow reticulocytes. Production of protoporphyrin by the bone marrow may increase further in EPP under conditions in which erythropoiesis is stimulated, leading to further increases in plasma and erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels. The liver had been proposed as an additional source of excess protoporphyrin, but this is now considered unlikely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In XLP, there is increased generation of the protoporphyrin substrate for FECH. The functioning FECH enzyme can utilize zinc to form zinc protoporphyrin. Thus, in XLP, zinc protoporphyrin makes up a greater proportion of excess protoporphyrin than seen with EPP. However, metal-free protoporphyrin predominates in most XLP cases, suggesting that the capacity of normal FECH activity to insert zinc into protoporphyrin is exceeded.</p><p>Total, metal-free, and zinc protoporphyrin are most conveniently measured in circulating erythrocytes. Plasma protoporphyrin is a separate pool, and its level may reflect both bone marrow production and liver uptake of protoporphyrin. (See <a href=\"#H3912289\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accumulation of metal-free protoporphyrin (&gt;85 percent of total erythrocyte protoporphyrin) is a distinctive feature of EPP and is accounted for by FECH deficiency. In EPP, &lt;15 percent of the total protoporphyrin is in the form of zinc protoporphyrin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accumulation of metal-free protoporphyrin is also characteristic of XLP. However, a greater proportion of zinc protoporphyrin (15 to 50 percent of total erythrocyte protoporphyrin) is characteristic of XLP due to <em>ALAS2</em> gain-of-function mutations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protoporphyrin that accumulates in other erythrocyte disorders, such as iron deficiency, lead poisoning, and anemia of chronic disease, is predominantly zinc protoporphyrin, since FECH activity is not appreciably decreased relative to the amount of available substrate (protoporphyrin) in these conditions.</p><p/><p>Metal-free protoporphyrin in erythrocytes is bound to hemoglobin, and light irradiation may promote its release from hemoglobin (and from erythrocytes), perhaps thereby increasing plasma porphyrin levels and photosensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Metal-free protoporphyrin diffuses from circulating erythrocytes into plasma more readily than does zinc protoporphyrin, most of which remains within erythrocytes for their full life span [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. It is also likely that bone marrow reticulocytes contribute protoporphyrin directly to the plasma pool.</p><p>As a result of diffusion of metal-free porphyrin from erythrocytes as they age, the total protoporphyrin content of erythrocytes declines with increasing red blood cell age in EPP, and &quot;fluorocytes&quot; seen on peripheral blood smears by fluorescence microscopy are younger erythrocytes that contain large amounts of metal-free protoporphyrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/1,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20-22</a>].</p><p>The excess protoporphyrin in plasma in EPP and XLP is bound to albumin and is taken up by the liver for secretion into bile, which is the only mechanism for removing this water-insoluble dicarboxylic porphyrin from the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75386\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75386 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/19,21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H491216970\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron in EPP and XLP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with EPP or XLP often have borderline iron deficiency, and it has been suggested that the excess protoporphyrin in EPP may downregulate iron absorption or lead to a redistribution of iron stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Although iron absorption was considered to be impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], elemental iron absorption has been found to be normal and hepcidin levels appropriately low in these patients. For example, a study that assessed iron absorption in eight individuals with EPP compared with nine controls did not find evidence for impaired iron absorption or increased hepcidin levels in the individuals with EPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Preclinical studies suggest that iron status may modulate porphyrin accumulation in EPP and XLP. As an example, iron is important for formation of the non-catalytic iron-sulfur cluster in FECH and may thereby enhance post-translational stability of the FECH protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Consequently, iron deficiency might further impair FECH stability. Furthermore, because iron is a substrate for FECH, its deficiency in EPP might, as in other iron deficiency states, increase protoporphyrin accumulation. Conversely, however, iron can upregulate ALAS2 and might increase protoporphyrin production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Therefore, it is unclear whether iron deficiency is harmful or beneficial in patients with EPP or XLP. (See <a href=\"#H1087313\" class=\"local\">'Iron'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31188034\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on skin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protoporphyrin is hydrophobic and deposited in lipid layers such as cell membranes; therefore, its tissue and subcellular distribution may differ from the hydrophilic porphyrins that accumulate and cause blistering manifestations in other cutaneous porphyrias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Porphyrins are photoactive and absorb light and enter an excited energy state, also known as a triplet form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. They can then transfer energy to dissolved oxygen to form the superoxide ion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), which in turn can form hydroxyl ions (OH<sup>-</sup>). These highly oxidizing species of oxygen can interact with many biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, and DNA, and can form adducts with carbon-carbon double bonds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/30,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32,33</a>]. Porphyrins absorb wavelengths of light especially in the 400 to 420 nm range (ie, the Soret peak for porphyrins), which is in the visible light range and close to the range of long wavelength ultraviolet light (ie, UVA; range 315 to 400 nm). Patients with EPP and other cutaneous porphyrias are sensitive to sunlight and to some extent fluorescent and even incandescent indoor lights. Window glass transmits this light (but not short wave ultraviolet light [ie, UVB]) and therefore is not protective. Porphyrin photoreactivity causes tissue damage through lipid peroxidation, oxidation of nucleic acids and polypeptides, complement activation, and mast cell degranulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/32,34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5453854\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver damage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted below, hepatopathy is a rare but potentially severe complication of EPP, affecting fewer than 5 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H7689026\" class=\"local\">'Liver disease'</a> below.)</p><p>It is not clear what predisposes some patients and not others to develop hepatopathy. In some cases, protoporphyric hepatopathy was precipitated by another cause of liver disease, such as excess alcohol consumption or viral hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Iron deficiency might also contribute by impairing the conversion of protoporphyrin to heme in the bone marrow, resulting in increasing amounts of protoporphyrin circulating to the liver. However, this possibility has not been well studied.</p><p>When it does occur, hepatopathy results from accumulation of protoporphyrin in the liver in amounts that are damaging to hepatocytes and cholangiocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This results in reduced biliary excretion of protoporphyrin and a progressive further buildup of protoporphyrin in the liver, plasma, and erythrocytes. Protoporphyrin has been shown to be cholestatic in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Hepatopathy develops in association with a severe <em>FECH</em> mutation and also in patients with <em>ALAS2</em> mutations, but no clear relationship to specific mutations has been found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. In a mouse model with inherited FECH deficiency, the development of hepatopathy is influenced by genetic background, but important modifier genes have not been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>As liver damage and impaired biliary excretion progress, protoporphyrin levels in plasma, erythrocytes, and liver increase further, causing more severe photosensitivity and further liver damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Erythrocyte survival is reduced by splenic enlargement, which may stimulate erythropoiesis and further increases in marrow protoporphyrin overproduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/9,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,46</a>].

The index of suspicion for EPP and XLP is often low because there are many causes of photosensitivity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57800\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57800 \">table 2</a>). Moreover, in contrast to other cutaneous porphyrias, skin findings are usually minimal and transient. Delay may also result from measuring urine porphyrins (which are not elevated) rather than total erythrocyte protoporphyrin.</p><p>The diagnosis of protoporphyria (EPP or XLP) should be considered in any patient with photosensitivity that is primarily acute and non-blistering. The diagnosis is readily established or excluded by measurement of total erythrocyte protoporphyrin (followed by fractionation, if elevated). Proper diagnosis may save patients years of unexplained pain and decreased quality of life. The ease of diagnosis and favorable impact of appropriate diagnosis, therapy, and genetic counseling makes the importance of considering the diagnosis of EPP and XLP especially compelling.</p><p>As with other porphyrias, our approach to diagnosis is to perform a sensitive screening test first, in this case total erythrocyte protoporphyrin, followed by fractionation if the initial result is positive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89123\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89123 \">algorithm 1</a>). Total plasma porphyrins are sent simultaneously. If biochemical testing confirms the diagnosis of EPP or XLP, we perform genetic testing in all patients.</p><p>Urinary and fecal porphyrin testing is not required in the evaluation for EPP or XLP.

Urinary porphyrins, delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and porphobilinogen (PBG) are normal, with the exception of patients with severe protoporphyric hepatopathy, in whom urinary porphyrins, especially coproporphyrin, may be increased, as occurs in liver disease from any cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8738170\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythrocyte protoporphyrin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary laboratory test for EPP and XLP is a measurement of total erythrocyte protoporphyrin, which normally ranges up to approximately 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89123\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89123 \">algorithm 1</a>). The most reliable assays extract and measure all erythrocyte porphyrins fluorometrically and express the total as protoporphyrin. Erythrocyte porphyrins in health and disease are almost entirely protoporphyrin, with the exception of patients with congenital erythropoietic porphyria.

An increase in total erythrocyte protoporphyrin is a nonspecific finding that can occur in many conditions, including iron deficiency, lead poisoning, anemia of chronic disease, and hemolytic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. However, in conditions other than EPP and XLP, the excess is mostly zinc protoporphyrin, whereas in EPP and most cases of XLP, it is predominantly metal-free protoporphyrin. In some XLP cases, the proportion of zinc protoporphyrin may exceed metal-free protoporphyrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]; in such cases, other causes of increased erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin should be excluded and <em>ALAS2</em> gene sequencing relied upon for diagnosis of XLP.

This greater abundance of zinc protoporphyrin can almost always differentiate XLP from EPP, but confirmation by DNA studies is strongly advised.</p><p/><p>Confusion among laboratories about terminology and methods for measuring erythrocyte porphyrins can complicate testing for EPP and XLP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. This occurs because some commercial laboratories without expertise in porphyria use a particular fluorescence instrument (hematofluorometer) for measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin that was originally developed for screening for lead poisoning and is tuned to measure only zinc protoporphyrin; however, these laboratories may incorrectly report the results as &quot;erythrocyte protoporphyrin&quot; (implying that total erythrocyte protoporphyrin was measured) or &quot;free erythrocyte protoporphyrin.&quot; Therefore, one must select a laboratory that measures total erythrocyte protoporphyrin and can then fractionate metal-free and zinc protoporphyrin.

The total plasma porphyrin concentration is elevated in most patients with EPP and XLP, but less so than in other cutaneous porphyrias, and may be normal in milder cases. In addition, plasma porphyrins in EPP and XLP are especially sensitive to light and may degrade rapidly during sample processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Therefore, plasma porphyrin measurement is helpful in establishing the diagnosis of EPP or XLP but cannot be relied upon for initial testing or used alone as an initial screening test for protoporphyria.</p><p>Fluorescence scanning of plasma is performed in addition to measurement of plasma porphyrins; it can be performed on the same plasma sample. In EPP or XLP, the fluorescence of plasma (diluted at neutral pH) shows a peak at a wavelength of approximately 634 nm. However, this may be absent in mild cases. This fluorescence peak near 634 nm differs from other porphyrias (eg, peak near 626 nm in variegate porphyria [VP], peak near 620 nm in porphyria cutanea tarda [PCT] and congenital erythropoietic porphyria [CEP]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>In individuals with EPP and XLP, plasma porphyrin levels correlate roughly with the levels of total erythrocyte protoporphyrin. The latter is felt to remain fairly constant throughout life, although longitudinal data are lacking. However, plasma protoporphyrin levels are much more variable over time. This is likely to be because the plasma pool of protoporphyrin turns over more rapidly. Plasma porphyrin is also likely to be the source of protoporphyrin uptake by the liver. Therefore, a higher plasma level may indicate a greater risk for hepatic complications.

Like EPP or XLP, the symptoms occur on sun-exposed areas, and family members may have similar symptoms. Unlike EPP or XLP, individuals with PMLE generally have discrete lesions such as pruritic papules, papulovesicles, or plaques, and the lesions develop later than EPP or XLP (hours to days rather than minutes); individuals with PMLE do not have elevations of total erythrocyte protoporphyrin as measured by a reliable laboratory (see <a href=\"#H3912289\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above).

Like EPP or XLP, patients may have painful erythroderma soon after sun exposure, often within minutes. Unlike EPP or XLP, phototoxic reactions are associated with use of the photosensitizing agent, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin is not elevated.

Sunburn can occur in individuals without an underlying dermatologic condition, with sensitivity dependent on the degree of skin pigmentation and hair and eye color. Like EPP or XLP, sunburn is a transient, painful, erythematous reaction that often does not cause blistering or scarring, and members of a family may have similar sensitivities. Unlike EPP or XLP, most individuals, even those who sunburn easily, do not develop symptoms upon normal daily sunlight exposure.

Patients have learned to avoid sunlight or fluorescent light as much as possible. Parents of children with EPP and XLP also learn how to protect them from sunlight exposure. This requires considerable adjustments in lifestyle and may limit educational and employment opportunities. Other forms of photoprotection and other interventions are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5455084\"><span class=\"h2\">Photoprotection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4971217\"><span class=\"h3\">Sun and UV light avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protection from sunlight is a cornerstone of EPP management. The use of protective clothing and hats is essential for most patients when outdoors. Occlusive sunscreen preparations are of some benefit. As in other cutaneous porphyrias, window glass is not protective when indoors (or in a vehicle), and house and car windows should be equipped with protective tinted glass. Patients may require physician letters for state permission to use adequately tinted glass in their automobiles. Many patients also find it necessary to avoid indoor lighting.</p><p>Other sources of long wave ultraviolet (UVA) and visible light such as operating room lights may also cause phototoxic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Protection from light during surgical procedures using light filters has been best studied in the setting of liver transplantation, which is a prolonged operation in patients with hepatopathy and particularly high porphyrin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3912331\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> below). Complications in patients without hepatopathy undergoing more routine surgical procedures are uncommon.</p><p>We do not use topical application of dihydroxyacetone and Lawson (naphthoquinone), because of concerns about potential adverse cosmetic effects and carcinogenic potential with long-term use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/92-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">92-94</a>].</p><p>Although avoiding light is highly beneficial in preventing symptoms of EPP and XLP, it greatly limits options for employment and prevents engagement in many pleasurable outdoor activities with family and friends, thereby substantially reducing quality of life. Therefore, it is important to consider other therapies that may increase light tolerance and allow patients to have more normal lifestyles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4970632\"><span class=\"h3\">Afamelanotide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Afamelanotide is a synthetic analogue of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), a naturally occurring hormone that increases skin pigmentation by increasing melanin production, and reduces free radical formation and cytokine production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>].

For adults with EPP or XLP, we suggest afamelanotide. Some individuals may choose not to use afamelanotide if their lifestyle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> employment needs do not require greater sunlight tolerance. Pediatric administration has not been evaluated and pediatric dose implants are not available. Afamelanotide became available in parts of Europe in 2009 and is not available in the United States; it is under review at the US Food and Drug Administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>Afamelanotide is administered as a controlled-release 16 mg implant injected subcutaneously every other month. Administration is generally timed for the summer months.</p><p>Evidence for the efficacy of afamelanotide includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two multicenter, randomized trials in individuals 18 years or older with EPP or XLP found that afamelanotide substantially reduced photosensitivity and improved sunlight tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. In the European trial (74 patients followed for nine months), the duration of pain-free time in direct sunlight was longer with afamelanotide versus placebo (median 6.0 versus 0.8 hours) and the number of phototoxic reactions was lower in the afamelanotide group (77 versus 146). In the United States (US) trial (94 patients followed for six months) the duration of pain-free time in direct sunlight was longer in the afamelanotide group (median 69.4 versus 40.8 hours); the greater number of hours in the US trial reflects a longer portion of the day in which sunlight tolerance was assessed. In both trials, quality of life improved with afamelanotide therapy. Some participants described this treatment as 'life changing' in terms of activities they could engage in during treatment, which previously were not possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, in a retrospective study of 115 individuals with EPP who received afamelanotide at one of two porphyria centers for up to six years, 74 percent found the therapy to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Of the remaining individuals, 23 percent had to discontinue therapy for pregnancy or financial reasons, and 3 percent found the therapy to be ineffective. The mean quality of life scores for the group rose from 32 to 74 percent during the first six months of therapy and remained high (69 to 91 percent) for the duration of the study. Melanin density also increased but was challenging to interpret due to reduced therapy during the winter and increased sun exposure with effective therapy in some patients. The most frequent reasons for drug discontinuation were financial restrictions and pregnancy. This study population represented two-thirds of all individuals with EPP at these centers.</p><p/><p>Toxicities of afamelanotide appear to be minimal; the major adverse events are nausea and headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/96,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,99</a>].

However, clinical experience is limited. European product information for afamelanotide states it is not to be used during pregnancy or in individuals with hepatic or renal impairment, as there are no long term data regarding safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Although the tanning effect makes it difficult to blind patients or clinicians completely to the treatment, improved symptoms occurred in some in the placebo groups.</p><p>Although afamelanotide improves sun tolerance, it does not affect porphyrin production or alter the underlying disease process.

For most patients with EPP or XLP, we suggest the use of oral beta carotene. However, many patients do not find this therapy to be very beneficial, and many patients who wish to avoid the associated costs or skin discoloration elect to discontinue therapy. Some patients believe that they benefit and save on cost by taking beta-carotene mostly in spring and summer, which permits greater sunlight exposure and acquisition of a suntan that provides further sunlight protection.</p><p>Evidence supporting the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> includes several small studies and case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/101-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">101-109</a>]. In the largest series with 133 patients, 22 reported no effect and 111 reported moderate to substantial improvement in sunlight tolerance. A single randomized crossover trial enrolled 14 children; this showed that compared with placebo, individuals receiving beta-carotene had a small increase in time spent outdoors (equivalent to approximately 13 minutes daily) but no major difference in symptoms reported in diaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].</p><p>When we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>, we use pharmaceutical grade medication (brand name, Lumitene) developed specifically for treating EPP. It was originally available by prescription but is now available over the counter. For adults, we use oral doses of 30 to 300 mg (1 to 10 capsules) daily, and titrate to maintain serum carotene levels in the range of 600 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> or a tolerable degree of yellowish skin pigmentation, which is most prominent on the palms of the hands.

However, experience is limited, and we have not used this approach. N-acetylcysteine, a closely related product was shown to be ineffective in two double blind crossover placebo-controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/114,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,115</a>].</p><p/><p>We do not use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> to treat EPP, as it did not show benefit in a double blind randomized controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>], and therefore is not recommended.</p><p>We also do not recommend oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a>, which has been used in acute hepatic porphyrias, but in the absence of evidence for efficacy and safety. Cimetidine inhibits hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, and thereby ameliorates porphyria in an animal model (rodents treated with chemicals that are activated by these enzymes). However, cimetidine does not directly inhibit or down-regulate hepatic ALAS1, which is the basis for effective treatment of acute porphyrias with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>. In a 2016 report, decreased photosensitivity in response to oral cimetidine was described in three children with EPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. However, this was not a formal pilot study or trial, and decreases in protoporphyrin levels were not documented. There is no evidence or expectation that cimetidine can, as postulated, reduce erythroid ALAS2 in bone marrow erythroblasts and reticulocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1087313\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron supplementation in patients with EPP and XLP is controversial. As noted above, the reason for mild iron deficiency commonly seen in these patients is not understood. In a 2015 study, patients were able to absorb iron well from the gastrointestinal tract and did not have inappropriately high levels of hepcidin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H491216970\" class=\"local\">'Iron in EPP and XLP'</a> above.)</p><p>Some authorities feel that because iron can upregulate ALAS2, iron deficiency may be protective and iron supplementation is contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Some patients have had unexplained worsening of photosensitivity with iron therapy, although increases in porphyrin levels were not documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/118-121\" class=\"abstract_t\">118-121</a>]. In such cases it is possible that correction of iron deficiency may have transiently increased erythropoiesis, with a resulting short term increase in protoporphyrin production. However, in one patient with EPP, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-sucrose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iron sucrose</a> lowered porphyrin levels and improved sunlight tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. A patient with XLP also benefitted from iron replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Systematic studies of iron therapy in larger numbers of patients are needed.</p><p>Until further data become available, we use iron supplementation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> 325 mg one to three times daily) in patients with clearly low levels of serum ferritin (ie, less than approximately 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>.

This may help in the early detection of protoporphyric hepatopathy and anemia, respectively. Additionally, monitoring of hepatic function may help identify other possible causes of liver disease that may precipitate protoporphyric hepatopathy. However, this practice has not been studied prospectively, and it is not yet possible to identify those patients at risk of developing protoporphyria-related liver disease.</p><p>Erythrocyte and plasma porphyrin levels should be measured annually for early detection of increases in levels due to liver disease or change in iron status. Of note, on average, porphyrin levels are higher in XLP than in EPP, and individuals with higher total erythrocyte porphyrin levels are likely to be at greater risk for hepatopathy. Patients should be encouraged to enroll in longitudinal studies being conducted by the Porphyrias Consortium in the United States and EPNET in Europe in order to gain knowledge and develop better guidelines for long-term management.</p><p>If liver function tests are abnormal, the evaluation should exclude other causes of liver disease including biliary obstruction. Any reversible causes of liver dysfunction that might precipitate hepatopathy should be identified and treated. Liver biopsy is generally required to establish a diagnosis of protoporphyric hepatopathy and to exclude other liver diseases, and to plan further management aimed to prevent progression to liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].</p><p>Additionally, patients should avoid excess exposure to alcohol and hepatotoxic drugs, drugs or hormone preparations that impair hepatic excretory function, and calorie restriction; hepatitis A and B vaccinations should be provided.</p><p>Patients with EPP are very likely to develop vitamin D deficiency because of sunlight avoidance. Measurements of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D are performed annually, and we ensure that patients have a daily intake of 800 international units of vitamin D and 1000 mg of calcium; typically this requires vitamin D supplementation because sunlight avoidance is extreme. Individuals with vitamin D deficiency despite this intake may require higher doses of vitamin D.</p><p>Vaccination to prevent hepatitis A and B is important in EPP or XLP, as viral hepatitis could have especially deleterious consequences in individuals with underlying liver disease.

Testing the other parent can determine this likelihood. If the other parent's <em>FECH</em> genes are both normal, half the children will inherit the severe <em>FECH</em> mutation (which may be passed on to future generations); however, they will not have EPP because they also inherited one normal <em>FECH</em> allele.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>XLP</strong> &ndash; Inheritance of XLP (due to an <em>ALAS2</em> gain-of-function mutation) is sex linked.

Less commonly, females who inherit the mutation are affected if skewed lyonization (random X chromosome inactivation) results in preferential inactivation of the unaffected X chromosome.

Life expectancy generally is normal, unless porphyric hepatopathy develops. However, although these diseases may not shorten life expectancy, they have a greater impact on quality of life than do other cutaneous porphyrias and other diseases that cause photosensitivity because pain in EPP and XLP is more acute and intense and necessitates alterations in lifestyle and employment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria/abstract/53,150\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,150</a>].

The characteristic phenotype in EPP is due to loss-of-function mutations in the gene for ferrochelatase (<em>FECH</em>), or in XLP, a less common condition, to gain-of-function mutations in the gene for the erythroid form of delta-aminolevulinate synthase (<em>ALAS2</em>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4967539\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EPP is the most common porphyria in children and the third most common in adults, after porphyria cutanea tarda and acute intermittent porphyria. The incidence is similar in males and females. EPP is very rare in Africa and is more common in East Asian populations than in Caucasian populations. (See <a href=\"#H3912153\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The predominant clinical manifestation in both types of protoporphyria is painful, non-blistering cutaneous photosensitivity that occurs within minutes of sun exposure. Vesiculation may occur after prolonged exposure, and subtle, residual skin changes are seen with repeated exposure over months or years. Most patients avoid sunlight and have no physical findings. Hepatobiliary complications include protoporphyrin-containing gallstones and, in less than 5 percent of cases, severe liver failure. Patients are at risk for vitamin D deficiency due to sun avoidance, and some may have mild iron deficiency anemia, which is unexplained. Symptoms may improve during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H3912160\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EPP and XLP should be considered in any patient with acute and primarily non-blistering photosensitivity; delays in diagnosis are common. The primary screening laboratory test is measurement of total erythrocyte (red blood cell) protoporphyrin; if this is elevated, fractionation is used to distinguish between metal-free and zinc protoporphyrin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89123\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89123 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 4</a>). The diagnosis is made if total erythrocyte protoporphyrin is elevated with an increased percentage of erythrocyte metal-free protoporphyrin (&gt;85 percent in EPP and 50 to 85 percent in XLP). Genetic testing is confirmatory and important for genetic counseling and is strongly advised but not required for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3912289\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of EPP and XLP includes other photosensitivity disorders such as polymorphous light eruption, solar urticaria, drug-induced phototoxicity, and sunburn (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57800\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57800 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5454728\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protection from sunlight is a cornerstone of EPP management. The use of protective clothing, hats, and protective tinted automobile window glass is essential for most patients when outdoors or driving. Other strong sources of light including operating room lights should be used with caution. For adults with EPP or XLP, we suggest afamelanotide to improve sunlight tolerance and quality of life (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This is administered as a subcutaneous implant every other month. Although less effective, we also suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> for patients of all ages with EPP or XLP (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). These therapies do not alter porphyrin levels. (See <a href=\"#H5455084\" class=\"local\">'Photoprotection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with EPP and XLP should have monitoring of erythrocyte and plasma protoporphyrin levels, liver function tests, complete blood count (CBC), and ferritin at least once per year. Vitamin D supplementation is usually required. Vaccination to prevent hepatitis A and B is important. (See <a href=\"#H1111108\" class=\"local\">'Routine monitoring and interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A combination of treatments is often used for patients with decompensated hepatopathy. Any patient with EPP who develops cirrhosis or severe protoporphyric hepatopathy should be referred for evaluation for possible liver transplantation. In some individuals with severe hepatopathy, sequential liver transplantation and hematopoietic cell transplantation may be appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H3912324\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of gallstones and protoporphyric hepatopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing and counseling are appropriate especially for affected individuals with EPP or XLP and their first degree relatives.
