Cultures of bronchial secretions are unrevealing, and the symptoms unresponsive to antibiotics. Chest radiographs are frequently normal or show nonspecific changes resulting from bronchial wall thickening or bronchiectasis.

In a series of 82 patients with IBD and normal plain chest radiographs, 47 (57 percent) had abnormal findings on pulmonary function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Most of these patients had findings consistent with restrictive lung disease and a reduced diffusing capacity. A separate series of 85 patients with ulcerative colitis and 47 patients with Crohn's disease found that diffusing capacity was significantly lower during exacerbations of bowel disease than when gastrointestinal disease was quiescent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. No pulmonary symptoms were associated with these transient physiologic derangements.

When mild or not progressive, it is often not evaluated histopathologically, so the exact type of ILD is not always identified. Drug-induced pulmonary toxicity is an important cause of ILD among patients with IBD.

For patients with a rapid onset of dyspnea, fever, or respiratory distress, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and drug toxicity should be evaluated promptly. (See appropriate topic reviews.) </p><p>For patients with a more indolent onset of disease, the workup usually starts with a complete blood count and differential, antinuclear antibodies and antihistone antibodies if drug-induced lung disease is suspected, pulmonary function testing (PFT), and a conventional chest radiograph. Further studies depend on the results of the initial studies and the suspected site of involvement. The following are some examples:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5620986\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of airway involvement with inflammatory bowel disease is often based on the clinical presentation of cough and sputum production in a patient without evidence of an infectious tracheobronchitis or asthma. In patients with chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, or bronchiolitis, pulmonary function tests usually reveal airflow obstruction, but in contrast to asthma do not show significant reversibility following inhaled bronchodilator or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> hyperresponsiveness. (See <a href=\"#H112987945\" class=\"local\">'Airway involvement'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary function testing'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is usually based on the presence of typical chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings of airway dilation (ie, 1.5 times the diameter of the adjacent vessel or wider), often accompanied by bronchial wall thickening. (See <a href=\"#H112987945\" class=\"local\">'Airway involvement'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Computed tomography'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is suggested when airflow limitation is irreversible and associated with a gas transfer abnormality in a nonsmoker. The most consistent abnormalities on HRCT are expiratory air trapping (mosaic or diffuse) and bronchiolar wall thickening (eg, centrilobular nodules and &ldquo;tree-in-bud&rdquo; opacities). In addition, a pattern of diffuse ground glass opacity with a mosaic pattern of attenuation is seen in some patients. A firm diagnosis of bronchiolitis requires an open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy.

The expiratory loop may be normal. High resolution computed tomography of the trachea with three-dimensional reconstruction can provide additional support with visualization of the degree and extent of airway narrowing.

After a careful review of the history of medication use and potential exposures to infectious agents, the evaluation typically involves laboratory testing to assess for peripheral blood eosinophilia and antinuclear antibody positivity, pulmonary function testing to assess the severity of restrictive impairment, and HRCT of the lungs to determine the pattern and distribution of opacities.

As the airway inflammation improves, intravenous glucocorticoids are changed to oral and then inhaled preparations.</p><p>For patients who have IBD-associated airway involvement without immediate airway compromise, inhaled glucocorticoid therapy is frequently effective, although formal data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a case series, among 12 patients treated with inhaled glucocorticoids, nine had a significant improvement, but three experienced progressive and disabling disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Relatively high doses (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beclomethasone</a> 1500 to 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day)</span> were needed in some patients. We typically start with the equivalent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> 500 mcg twice daily and adjust based on the response to therapy. Inflammation in the larger airways tends to be more responsive than bronchiolitis, possibly due to relatively poor delivery of the inhaled medication to the affected small airways. Patients with copious sputum production (greater than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day)</span> and those with bronchiectasis are less likely to respond to inhaled glucocorticoids and may require oral glucocorticoids.

In general, for patients who respond or stabilize with treatment, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>&nbsp;dose is gradually tapered, aiming to reach 5 to 10 mg daily or on alternate days, by the end of 6 months, with attempted cessation after one year of therapy.</p><p>Most patients with parenchymal lung disease due to IBD have a good response to glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, for those with progressive pulmonary dysfunction despite therapy with systemic glucocorticoids, immunomodulatory therapy is usually added. For patients with ongoing need for immunomodulatory therapy to control their IBD, the optimal agent to control their IBD is usually chosen.

NSAIDs have been used successfully in other forms of inflammatory serositis, although the experience in patients with IBD is limited. Systemic glucocorticoid therapy is an alternative if the patient does not respond to NSAIDs or is unable to take them.
