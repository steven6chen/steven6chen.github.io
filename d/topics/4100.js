Cholesterol crystal embolization occurs when portions of an atherosclerotic plaque break off and embolize distally, resulting in partial or total occlusion of multiple small arteries (or glomerular arterioles), leading to tissue or organ ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Clinical issues related to renal atheroemboli will be reviewed here. Discussions of cholesterol crystal embolization in general and thromboembolic renal infarction are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atheroembolization is a complication of severe atherosclerosis. Thus, risk factors for atheroembolic disease, such as older age, male sex, diabetes, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and cigarette smoking, are the same as for the development of atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Established risk factors for atherosclerotic CVD'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6294037\"><span class=\"h2\">Inciting events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once formed, an atherosclerotic plaque may be disrupted by a variety of inciting events, producing cholesterol crystal emboli. These inciting events can be classified broadly into the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iatrogenic event, usually induced by angiography, cardiovascular surgery, or anticoagulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous event, induced by hemodynamic stress</p><p/><p>Cholesterol crystal embolization is iatrogenic in more than 70 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. It is often seen following manipulation of the aorta or other large arteries during angiography, angioplasty, or cardiovascular surgery. Mechanical aortic trauma, induced by radiological catheters or vessel <span class=\"nowrap\">manipulation/clamping,</span> causing plaque disruption, has a key role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/2-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-10</a>].</p><p>Angiography is the most common triggering event, accounting for as many as 80 percent of iatrogenic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The incidence of clinically apparent atheroemboli after angiography has not been well defined. The best risk estimates are summarized here:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary angiography is the most common angiographic procedure causing embolism, associated with an incidence varying from 0.06 to 1.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/6,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11-13</a>]. As an example, the incidence of atheroembolism following diagnostic cardiac catheterization was evaluated in a prospective study that included 1786 consecutive patients; clinical atheroembolism (cutaneous or renal) was diagnosed in 25 (1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Sixteen patients (0.9 percent) developed acute kidney injury that was thought to be due to renal atheroembolism rather than contrast nephropathy since it persisted for at least two weeks. However, not all patients with acute kidney injury had other evidence of peripheral embolization. The risk may be lower with a brachial rather than an iliofemoral approach since most atherosclerotic plaques are in the abdominal aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-diagnostic-cardiac-catheterization#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of diagnostic cardiac catheterization&quot;, section on 'Renal atheroemboli'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who undergo renal angiography for suspected atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis often have diffuse atherosclerosis and are at especially high risk. A summary of reported studies of such patients suggests an overall incidence of approximately 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p>It has also been suggested that treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, heparin, or thrombolytic agents may cause atheroemboli, perhaps because anticoagulation may interfere with the healing of ulcerated atheromatous plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/3,7,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,15-17</a>]. However, anticoagulant-associated atheroembolism is uncommon, even in patients with severe aortic plaque (0.7 to 1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In addition, most patients with atheroemboli associated with anticoagulation have a second potential trigger, usually recent angiography. Anticoagulation is the sole inciting event in only 7 percent of such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Hemodynamic stress leading to spontaneous embolization was the most common form in historical reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. However, as noted, most cases are now related to iatrogenic triggers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholesterol crystal embolization to the kidney typically produces a subacute kidney injury observed several weeks or more after a possible inciting event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Severe hypertension may also be present. Less commonly, acute kidney injury occurring within one to two weeks after the inciting event may be seen, usually in association with massive embolization. Patients with renal atheroemboli are typically older (mean age was 71 to 72 years in two large series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], have a bland urine sediment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/3,7,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,24,25</a>], and may have peripheral eosinophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>However, kidney injury due to atheroemboli is not the most common presentation; rather, it is often found after the patient has presented in some other way. This is likely because, when it occurs, atheroembolism is ubiquitous, affecting varied vascular distributions. Thus, renal disease from atheroembolism is part of a multisystem disorder. The clinical presentation is more frequently related to atheroembolization of the skin (producing &quot;blue toe syndrome&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58761 \">picture 1</a>) or livedo reticularis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F79545\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79545 \">picture 2</a>)), mesentery (producing intestinal ischemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, or pancreatitis), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> central nervous system (producing transient ischemic attack, confusion, or visual symptoms). Presenting symptoms may also be subtle and nonspecific, such as fever, myalgias, headache, and weight loss. In addition, patients at risk for atheroembolism are not routinely monitored for worsening kidney function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atheroembolism is not uncommon as a cause of acute kidney injury in older adult patients. This was illustrated in a series of 259 patients over the age of 60 years who underwent renal biopsy for acute kidney injury; 7 percent had atheroembolic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The renal manifestations of atheroembolic disease are usually different from those seen with clot emboli. Clot emboli primarily occur in patients with atrial arrhythmias or a prior myocardial infarction. They tend to produce complete arterial occlusion and renal infarction, leading to flank pain, hematuria, and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase with relatively normal transaminases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By comparison, atheroemboli are typically nondistensible and irregularly shaped; as a result, they tend to produce incomplete occlusion with secondary ischemic atrophy rather than renal infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. With time, a foreign body reaction often ensues, causing intimal proliferation, giant cell formation, and further narrowing of the vascular lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This reaction presumably contributes to the progressive decline in renal function that often occurs for three to eight weeks after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The net effect of this pathogenic process, when combined with varying amounts of cholesterol embolization, is three somewhat different clinical presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/2,4,7,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,7,28,29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked renal impairment with an acute onset, seen within one to two weeks of a clear inciting event, is most frequently due to massive embolization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common presentation of the disease is subacute kidney injury, in which progressive renal dysfunction occurs in staggered steps, separated by periods of stable kidney function (often referred to as a &quot;staircase pattern&quot;). In this setting, renal impairment is usually observed several weeks or more after a possible insult; others, however, present with uremia and no clear precipitating event. This presentation is probably due to some combination of recurrent embolization and foreign body reaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The least common presentation is the patient with chronic stable renal impairment and clinical features similar to those with ischemic nephropathy (due to bilateral renal artery stenosis) and nephrosclerosis, which frequently coexist with cholesterol emboli. The role of cholesterol embolization in patients with ischemic nephropathy and nephrosclerosis is somewhat unclear. Many such patients are misdiagnosed because the crystal embolization is clinically silent (ie, extrarenal signs are frequently absent) and renal or skin biopsy is not performed. If a biopsy is performed, evidence for cholesterol embolization, which can be patchy, may be absent. The presence and clinical consequences of intimal proliferation and vascular-lumen narrowing are probably common features of these disease processes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urinalysis in patients with renal atheroemboli is typically benign with few cells or casts, a finding consistent with ischemic atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/3,7,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,24,25</a>]. Proteinuria is usually not a prominent feature, except in patients with underlying diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; however, nephrotic-range proteinuria (as high as 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> has been rarely reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/2,25,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25,30</a>]. Some patients have an active urinary sediment, including hematuria and, rarely, red cell casts. In this setting, an acute glomerulonephritis or vasculitis may be suspected, particularly if there are extrarenal manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Eosinophiluria also may be seen if the urine sediment is examined with Hansel's stain soon after the renal atheroemboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. One report of 52 patients noted eosinophiluria in only 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, many of these patients may have been evaluated after the acute phase, a time at which eosinophil activation would have ceased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Eosinophilia and hypocomplementemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two other abnormalities that commonly occur during the acute phase are eosinophilia and hypocomplementemia; these changes may reflect immunologic activation at the surface of the exposed atheroemboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/28,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,33,34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 354 patients, 238 (67 percent) had an eosinophil count &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypocomplementemia has been reported in 39 percent of patients in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, this finding has not always been confirmed by other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of renal atheroemboli requires a high index of suspicion and knowledge of the associated risk factors. A clinical diagnosis can be made when a potential inciting event (usually angiography) is followed by the delayed onset of kidney injury (typically several weeks or longer rather than hours or days), particularly when there are signs of extrarenal atheroemboli. Renal biopsy is regarded as the definitive method for diagnosis. Alternatively, biopsy of a skin lesion (if present) is a simple, minimally invasive procedure with a high diagnostic yield. Less commonly, histological confirmation may be made in other organs, such as the gastrointestinal track.</p><p>However, tissue biopsy is <strong>not</strong> necessary in patients with iatrogenic atheroembolic renal disease presenting with all of the following features of the classical clinical triad:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A precipitating event (such as aortic or coronary angiography)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute or acute kidney injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical skin findings, such as blue toe syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58761 \">picture 1</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> livedo reticularis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F79545\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79545 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p/><p>In addition, a biopsy may be deferred in patients with suspected atheroembolic renal disease if retinal cholesterol crystal emboli (Hollenhorst plaques) are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63740\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63740 \">picture 3</a>). Like histology, fundoscopy examination may confirm the diagnosis and should never be omitted.</p><p>Conversely, renal biopsy is crucial for diagnosis of cases with a chronic, smoldering presentation of renal atheroembolization. A tissue sample is also required to make a definitive diagnosis in patients presenting with a spontaneous (rather than iatrogenic) form of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9412009\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should identify potential complications of atheroembolic disease, including skin discoloration of the lower extremities; neurologic deficits, including amaurosis fugax; and abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/2,3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,15</a>].

Persistence or recurrence is suggestive of continued atheroembolization. However, these findings are also associated with other renal diseases, including some forms of glomerulonephritis.

Patients with ATN characteristically have an acute and progressive rise in the serum creatinine concentration within several days of the procedure that then stabilizes and returns to or near the baseline level after a variable period of 4 to 21 days.

Therapeutic modalities are mostly preventive and supportive. General issues related to the medical and surgical therapy of atheroembolic disease are discussed in detail separately. In addition, all patients should be aggressively treated for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. These modalities include statins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, blood pressure control, cessation of smoking, and, in patients with diabetes, glycemic control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with atheroembolic disease, secondary prevention relies upon removal of the causes of atheroembolism and prevention of new showers of atheroemboli. Consideration should be given in affected patients to withdrawal of anticoagulation and avoidance or postponement of new radiologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vascular surgery procedures, if possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism#H1503460\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;, section on 'Preventing recurrent embolization'</a>.)</p><p>There is no proven effective medical therapy in patients with atheroembolic renal disease. Observational studies suggest that statin use may be associated with better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. As an example, a study followed 354 patients with renal atheroembolic disease for a mean of two years; 116 eventually required dialysis, and 102 died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Baseline use of statins was independently associated with a lower risk of developing end-stage or death (relative risk 0.53, 95% CI 0.36-0.77).</p><p>A potential benefit of low-dose steroids has been reported in retrospective series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/9,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,35</a>], but this finding was not confirmed in a prospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Patients with renal atheroemboli have a poor overall prognosis, which in part reflects the severity of the underlying vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8</a>]. In the study of 354 patients mentioned above, 33 percent of patients developed end-stage renal disease, and 28 percent of patients died after a mean follow-up of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Kidney injury may be followed by partial recovery of renal function. In one study, for example, 24 percent of patients with renal atheroemboli but no other complications, such as sepsis or hypotension, had recovery of renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Recovery may be due to a number of factors, including resolution of concurrent acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in borderline ischemic areas, the development of collateral flow, or hypertrophy in surviving nephrons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-treatment-of-renal-atheroemboli/abstract/2,3,24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,24,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H534316464\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Cholesterol crystal embolization usually affects older patients with diffuse erosive atherosclerosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholesterol crystal embolization is often seen after manipulation of the aorta or other large arteries during arteriography, angioplasty, or surgery, but may also occur spontaneously. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, heparin, or thrombolytic agents may increase the risk, but anticoagulant-associated atheroembolism is uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholesterol crystal embolization to the kidney typically produces a subacute kidney injury observed several weeks or more after a possible inciting event. Severe hypertension may also be present. However, an increased serum creatinine is not the most common presentation; rather, it is often found after the patient has presented in some other way since atheroembolism is ubiquitous, affecting various vascular beds, and since laboratory studies to monitor for atheroembolic kidney injury are not routinely performed. Thus, the presentation is more frequently related to atheroembolization of the skin (producing &quot;blue toe syndrome&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58761 \">picture 1</a>) or livedo reticularis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F79545\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79545 \">picture 2</a>)), mesentery (producing intestinal ischemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, or pancreatitis), and central nervous system (producing transient ischemic attack, confusion, or visual symptoms). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal cholesterol crystal embolization can produce an acute decline in kidney function within one to two weeks of an inciting event; more commonly, a subacute presentation, in which progressive renal dysfunction occurs in staggered steps several weeks or more after an insult; or chronic stable renal impairment and clinical features similar to those with ischemic nephropathy due to bilateral renal artery stenosis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Kidney injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The urinalysis is typically benign with few cells or casts, and proteinuria is usually not a prominent feature; however, nephrotic-range proteinuria has been reported. Some patients have an active urine sediment, including hematuria, and, rarely, red cell casts. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Urinary findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other laboratory findings include eosinophilia and hypocomplementemia, possibly reflecting immunologic activation at the surface of the exposed atheroemboli. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Eosinophilia and hypocomplementemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical diagnosis of renal atheroemboli can be made when a potential inciting event (usually angiography) is followed by the delayed onset of kidney injury (typically weeks or longer rather than hours or days), particularly when there are signs of extrarenal atheroemboli. Renal or skin biopsy is regarded as the definitive method for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tissue biopsy is <strong>not</strong> necessary in patients with iatrogenic atheroembolic renal disease presenting with all of the following features of the classical clinical triad (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A precipitating event (such as aortic or coronary angiography)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Subacute or acute kidney injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Typical skin findings, such as blue toe syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58761 \">picture 1</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> livedo reticularis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F79545\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79545 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A biopsy may also be deferred in patients with suspected atheroembolic renal disease if retinal cholesterol crystal emboli (Hollenhorst plaques) are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63740\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63740 \">picture 3</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversely, renal biopsy is crucial for diagnosis of cases with a chronic, smoldering form of renal atheroembolization. A tissue sample is also required to make a definitive diagnosis in patients presenting with spontaneous form of the disorder. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9412354\" class=\"local\">'Tissue biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of renal atheroemboli developing after angiography or vascular surgery primarily includes radiocontrast media-induced or postischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). These conditions can often be distinguished by the absence or presence of extrarenal emboli and by the clinical course. In addition, the differential diagnosis includes acute interstitial nephritis and systemic vasculitis, particularly in patients with eosinophilia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypocomplementemia.
