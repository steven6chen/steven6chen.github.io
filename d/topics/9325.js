Extragonadal GCTs typically arise in midline locations, and specific sites vary with age. In adults, the most common sites are the anterior mediastinum, retroperitoneum, and the pineal and suprasellar regions. In infants and young children, intracranial GCTs and sacrococcygeal teratomas are more common than other locations.</p><p>Intracranial GCTs are discussed here. Throughout the text we generally do not distinguish between children and adults. It is important to note, however, that the literature on intracranial GCTs is largely based on children under the age of 15 years, and historical data and outcomes are being extrapolated to young adults based on a small proportion of these patients in most series.</p><p>Sacrococcygeal teratomas and extragonadal GCTs arising in the mediastinum and retroperitoneum are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sacrococcygeal-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sacrococcygeal germ cell tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extragonadal germ cell tumors involving the mediastinum and retroperitoneum&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In North America and Europe, intracranial GCTs represent 0.5 to 3 percent of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast, these tumors are substantially more frequent in Japan and other Asian countries, with a reported incidence of up to 11 percent of pediatric CNS tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Even in the United States, individuals with <span class=\"nowrap\">Asian/Pacific</span> Islander ancestry have a two- to threefold higher risk of intracranial GCT compared with whites, suggesting that genetic factors may be more important than environmental factors in the etiology of GCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The peak incidence of intracranial GCT is during the second decade of life, with a median age at diagnosis of 10 to 12 years. There is a male preponderance of between 2:1 to 3:1, especially with tumors in the pineal region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Histogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various theories have been proposed to explain the origin of extragonadal GCTs. These are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extragonadal germ cell tumors involving the mediastinum and retroperitoneum&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular biology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Collaborative efforts have begun to shed light on the molecular pathogenesis of intracranial GCTs. Prior to these efforts, the best described abnormalities were isochromosome 12p [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>] and gain-of-function mutations of <em>KIT </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>In an international collaborative study, 62 intracranial GCTs were analyzed using next generation sequencing techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The analysis confirmed many previously described alterations and identified several novel abnormalities that may have therapeutic potential. Overall, 53 percent of tumors harbored somatic mutations in at least one of the genes involved in the <span class=\"nowrap\">KIT/RAS</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">AKT/mTOR</span> signalling pathways.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>KIT</em> mutations were identified in 16 tumors (26 percent), exclusively in germinomas. Mutations were clustered in exon 17 and 11, similar to mutations described in testicular seminoma, but distinct from those described in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors (GIST). Such mutations may be of therapeutic significance, as multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target <em>KIT</em> are in development or already in use in other malignancies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>KRAS</em> or <em>NRAS</em> mutations, downstream targets of the <em>KIT</em> receptor, were found in 19 percent of tumors, mutually exclusive with <em>KIT</em> mutations. <em>RAS</em> mutations are well described in non-small cell lung cancer and colon cancer but no effective targeted therapies have yet been identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in <em>CBL</em> (caspase B-lineage lymphoma), which encodes a RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase and is a negative regulator of <em>KIT</em> expression, were identified in seven tumors. <em>CBL</em> mutations have been described in some hematologic cancers and are associated with <em>KIT</em> overexpression. Copy number analysis of <em>CBL</em> showed that 13 out of 28 intracranial germ cell tumors in this series had either clonal or subclonal 11q loss of heterozygosity spanning the <em>CBL</em> locus, strongly suggesting a key role of <em>CBL </em>in the pathogenesis of intracranial germ cell tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms#H23235668\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Other mutations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combined frequency of <em>KIT, <span class=\"nowrap\">KRAS/NRAS,</span> and CBL </em><span class=\"nowrap\">mutation/genetic</span> alteration in this series of intracranial germ cell tumors exceed 50 percent, supportive of this molecular pathway&rsquo;s contribution to tumorigenesis and highlighting the therapeutic possibility of targeting this pathway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nineteen percent of the intracranial germ cell tumors of this series showed <em>AKT1</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">amplification/copy</span> number gain, associated with elevated mRNA expression. This discovery also suggests that use of <span class=\"nowrap\">AKT1/mTOR</span> inhibitors may be worthy of clinical investigation in patients with intracranial germ cell tumors.</p><p/><p>Other studies further confirm involvement of the MAPK <span class=\"nowrap\">(KIT/RAS)</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">PI3K/mTOR</span> pathways in intracranial germ cell tumors. One study found mutually exclusive mutations of KIT or RAS in 60 percent of germinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. High expression of KIT mRNA was also associated with severe chromosomal instability. In another study, KIT and RAS mutations were observed in germinomas and all subtypes of NGGCT; combining KIT, RAS, and other less frequently mutated genes such as CBL, alterations in the MAPK pathway were observed in 48 percent of all germ cell tumors, including 64 percent of germinomas and 20 to 50 percent of other subtypes of NGGCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Mutations in the PI3K pathway were observed in 12 percent of intracranial germ cell tumors, with mTOR mutations (6.5 percent) being the most common. <em>In vitro </em>treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in tumors with PI3K pathway mutations led to tumor suppression.</p><p>This emerging genomic information offers promise that therapies targeting the MAPK and PI3K pathways could prove useful in refractory intracranial germ cell tumors or in the newly diagnosed setting as part of a strategy to further reduce or eliminate radiation in some patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the World Health Organization classification system, intracranial GCTs are divided into germinomas and non-germinomatous GCTs (NGGCTs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82711 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. NSGGCTs include embryonal carcinoma, endodermal sinus tumor (also known as yolk sac tumor), choriocarcinoma, teratoma (immature and mature), and mixed tumors with more than one element. Germinomas comprise 60 to 65 percent of all pediatric intracranial GCTs. Approximately 25 percent of NGGCTs are mixed and contain more than one histologic component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Intracranial GCTs can be further defined by tumor markers secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum, as well as by the presence of histochemical markers on tumor cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81974 \">table 2</a>). Secreted tumor markers measured in the CSF and serum include alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), and immunohistochemistry is used to detect placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and c-Kit on tumor cells.</p><p>Histologically, pure germinomas are composed of large polygonal undifferentiated cells with abundant cytoplasm arranged in nests separated by bands of connective tissue. The histologic appearance of NGGCTs varies depending upon the specific cell types present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Infiltrating small lymphocytes are often present and can obscure the diagnosis, especially in small biopsy specimens.</p><p>Intracranial GCTs can also be divided into &quot;secreting&quot; and &quot;nonsecreting&quot; tumors. Secreting tumors are commonly defined as GCTs with CSF AFP &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/L</span> (or above the institutional normal range) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a CSF beta-hCG level &gt;50 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span>. Secreting GCTs are generally considered to behave more aggressively and carry a poorer prognosis than nonsecreting GCTs.</p><p>Pure germinomas generally are associated with absent AFP and beta-hCG levels in both CSF and serum. Although an elevated AFP in either the serum or CSF effectively rules out a pure germinoma, a minority of germinomas are associated with elevated beta-hCG levels in the CSF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The source of the elevated beta-hCG is thought to be syncytiotrophoblasts that are associated with germinomas. (See <a href=\"#H5141721\" class=\"local\">'Beta-HCG secreting germinomas'</a> below.)</p><p>Another classification system commonly used in Japan separates intracranial GCTs into &quot;good&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, and &quot;poor prognosis&quot; groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Pure germinomas and mature teratomas are included in the &quot;good prognosis&quot; group. Choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, embryonal carcinoma, and mixed NGGCTs composed mainly of these three histologies are included in the &quot;poor prognosis&quot; group, with all other tumors included in the &quot;intermediate prognosis&quot; group. Patients in the &quot;good prognosis&quot; have over-all survival exceeding 90 percent, while patients in the &quot;intermediate&quot; and &quot;poor prognosis&quot; groups have over-all survival rates of approximately 70 and 40 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracranial GCTs arise almost exclusively from midline locations. The two most frequent sites are the pineal gland and the suprasellar regions, with pineal tumors occurring nearly twice as often as suprasellar GCTs. Intracranial GCTs can also arise in the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebral hemisphere, and cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>In five to ten percent of cases, patients present with tumors at both pineal and suprasellar locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]; these tumors are usually pure germinomas. Tumor seeding or multiple tumor nodules along the lateral and third ventricles are observed in about 10 percent of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presenting symptoms of patients with intracranial GCTs depend upon the location of the tumor. Delays in diagnosis are common, especially symptoms related to endocrinopathy (delayed vertical growth, diabetes insipidus, etc.) are associated with delays of greater than 12 months, and are associated with higher incidences of disseminated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H431567392\"><span class=\"h3\">Pineal tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pineal tumors typically cause obstructive hydrocephalus. Patients present with signs of increased intracranial pressure (headache, vomiting, papilledema, lethargy, somnolence) in 25 to 50 percent of cases. Other symptoms associated with pineal GCTs and obstructive hydrocephalus include ataxia, behavioral changes, and decline in academic performance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pineal-gland-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pineal gland masses&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Neuroopthalmologic abnormalities (especially paralysis of upward gaze and convergence) are present in up to 50 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supranuclear disorders of gaze in children&quot;, section on 'Parinaud syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Endocrinopathies are rarely associated with pineal tumors at diagnosis, although diabetes insipidus is sometimes observed and may indicate occult tumor involvement of the floor of the fourth ventricle and the suprasellar area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H431567399\"><span class=\"h3\">Suprasellar tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suprasellar GCTs most commonly present with <span class=\"nowrap\">hypothalamic/pituitary</span> dysfunctions, including diabetes insipidus, delayed pubertal development or precocious puberty, isolated growth hormone deficiency, or other aspects of hypopituitarism (central hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Suprasellar GCTs can also cause ophthalmologic abnormalities such as decreased visual acuity from chiasmic or optic nerve compression or visual field deficit (classically, bitemporal hemianopsia). Patients with suprasellar GCTs often have chronic subtle symptoms, and their tumors are diagnosed incidentally on imaging studies performed for unrelated reasons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic examination is needed to establish a definitive diagnosis of an intracranial GCT and to ascertain the histologic subtype. A tissue sample should be obtained unless surgery cannot be performed safely. Surgery to obtain tissue for diagnosis is MANDATORY for patients with normal CSF and serum AFP and beta-hCG, as a pure germinoma or a mature teratoma must be distinguished from other benign and malignant lesions, including pineal primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), ependymoma (pineal location), craniopharyngioma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (suprasellar location), low-grade glioma, hamartoma, or metastatic disease from extra-cranial tumors (either location). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>An elevated level of AFP in either the CSF or serum is sufficient to classify a tumor as a NGGCT, although tumor tissue is useful for prognostic classification and biologic studies. Patients with an elevated beta-hCG (&gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L)</span> but normal AFP should undergo surgery if possible to distinguish a beta-hCG secreting germinoma from an immature teratoma or a choriocarcinoma, as the latter are considered NGGCTs and need more aggressive treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging technique for diagnosis and staging, although computed tomography (CT) is also very sensitive in detecting suprasellar and pineal GCTs.</p><p>On MRI, intracranial GCTs appear isointense or hypointense on T1 sequences and hyperintense on T2 sequences. These tumors typically show homogeneous enhancement with gadolinium or heterogeneous enhancement if cysts are present. Imaging characteristics of the histologic subtypes are similar, and MRIs cannot reliably distinguish germinomas from NGGCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>MRI of the entire spine is imperative for adequate staging of intracranial GCTs, since 10 to 15 percent of patients will have leptomeningeal spread diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distinction between germinomas and NGGCTs is critical, since patients with germinomas have a more favorable prognosis and require less intensive therapy than those with NGGCTs. Tumor markers, such as AFP and beta-hCG, are helpful in making this distinction, although histologic examination is required for a definitive diagnosis.</p><p>Pure germinomas and mature teratomas typically present with normal levels of AFP and beta-hCG in both serum and CSF. Some histologically confirmed germinomas have elevated beta-hCG levels that are presumed to be due to beta-hCG secreting syncytiotrophoblasts. In such cases, elevations of serum beta-hCG are generally limited (&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L),</span> although some tumors have levels &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5141721\" class=\"local\">'Beta-HCG secreting germinomas'</a> below.)</p><p>Any tumor with an elevated AFP (&gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/L</span> or higher than the institutional normal range) can be assumed to contain elements of endodermal sinus tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immature teratoma. If a histologic diagnosis is not possible because surgery is contraindicated, such a patient should be treated as having a NGGCT. Pure endodermal sinus tumor or pure choriocarcinomas are often associated with dramatic elevations in AFP (&gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/L)</span> or beta-hCG (&gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L),</span> whereas immature teratomas have less dramatic elevations of AFP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> beta-hCG. A serum AFP &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/L</span> has recently been identified as a poor prognostic indicator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], but since a significant proportion of these tumors have mixed components, it is not yet feasible to use tumor markers for risk stratification without a tissue diagnosis.</p><p>Measurement of AFP and beta-hCG in the CSF is more sensitive than serum levels in detecting abnormalities. However, discordant serum and CSF tumor marker results have been observed, and both serum and CSF tumor markers should be obtained in the absence of clinical contraindications. If a lumbar puncture can be safely performed, lumbar CSF is considered more accurate for tumor markers and cytology than ventricular CSF. However, if a lumbar puncture is contraindicated, then tumor markers from ventricular CSF can be used for diagnostic purpose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">CSF cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSF cytology should be obtained during staging of an intracranial GCT whenever a lumbar puncture can be safely performed. Even if MRI of the spine does not show evidence of tumor involvement, patients with positive CSF cytology are considered to have metastatic intracranial GCTs and should receive craniospinal irradiation (CSI) as part of their treatment. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtaining tissue to establish a histologic diagnosis should be strongly considered for patients with a suspected intracranial GCT, unless the morbidity of the procedure outweighs the benefit. In addition, immediate neurosurgical intervention is indicated for obstructive hydrocephalus from a pineal mass or for acute visual deterioration from a suprasellar mass. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and staging'</a> above.)</p><p>Surgical biopsies often yield only a small sample, and this can lead to an inaccurate tissue diagnosis. As an example, in a mixed GCT that contains both germinoma and non-germinomatous components, a small biopsy may only include an area of pure germinoma. When the tissue diagnosis is discordant from the CSF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serum markers, treatment should be based upon the result that is associated with the most malignant histology and worst prognosis. As an example, a tissue diagnosis of a pure germinoma would be inconsistent with an elevated AFP, and such a patient should be considered as having a NGGCT. Conversely, if the tissue diagnosis reveals elements of a NGGCT, despite normal AFP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> beta-hCG levels, the patient should be treated as having a NGGCT and not a pure germinoma.</p><p>Gross total resection at diagnosis is indicated only for patients with mature teratoma confirmed by histology and normal tumor markers, since surgery is curative and no further interventions are required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/18,19,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,29</a>].</p><p>A gross total resection of localized germinomas is generally not recommended because of the risk of surgical complications and because pure germinomas are exquisitely sensitive to radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Localized germinoma'</a> below.)</p><p>The benefit of gross total tumor resection in localized NGGCTs has not been established; several large series have not confirmed that macroscopic tumor resection improves the final outcome of children with intracranial NGGCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/19,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,27,28</a>]. Instead of pursuing a macroscopic resection of a NGGCT at the initial surgery, such a procedure may be performed more safely after tumor reduction by chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy (RT). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Nongerminomatous GCTs'</a> below.)</p><p>With continued evolution of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for intracranial GCTs, the role of neurosurgery for diagnosing and treating these tumors also continues to be discussed and reexamined. A publication from the Second International Symposium on Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors provides an excellent review on neurosurgery recommendations in pediatric intracranial GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Localized germinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracranial germinomas are exquisitely sensitive to radiation. Most contemporary series have reported long-term progression free survival (PFS) rates &gt;90 percent for patients with localized, pure germinomas after radiation therapy (RT) alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/31-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-37</a>]. </p><p>Historically, patients with localized germinomas received 36 Gy craniospinal irradiation (CSI) and a boost to the primary tumor for a total of 50 to 54 Gy. Subsequent studies demonstrated that replacing CSI with whole-brain or whole-ventricle irradiation in patients with localized germinomas resulted in a spinal failure rate of less than 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/18,33,38-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,33,38-44</a>]. The patterns of relapse following whole-brain or whole-ventricle RT compared to CSI were not significantly different, suggesting that recurrent germinomas after RT are unlikely to be related to a volume reduction in RT. Whole-ventricle RT with an additional boost to the tumor therefore replaced CSI in the treatment of localized germinoma. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Whole ventricular RT'</a> below.) </p><p>The remaining issue with RT, even when limited to whole-ventricle, however, is the incidence of clinically significant late neurocognitive and endocrine complications. Thus, clinical research has focused on reducing both the dose and volume of radiation, without compromising the excellent survival rate. Germinomas are also highly sensitive to chemotherapy, and more recent studies have added chemotherapy and reduced the dose of RT in an effort to further minimize late complications.
