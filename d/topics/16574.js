Histologic findings consist of inflammation and suppuration within the vein wall. Thrombus with or without pus may be seen within the vein lumen, with evidence of perivascular inflammation.</p><p>Suppurative thrombophlebitis should be suspected in patients with persistent bacteremia after 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, particularly in the setting of an intravascular catheter. The diagnosis may be made based on culture data together with radiographic evidence of thrombosis. The principles of treatment for suppurative thrombophlebitis include removing the focus of infection (eg, intravenous catheter), prompt administration of intravenous antibiotics, and consideration regarding surgical intervention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anticoagulation.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, microbiology, diagnosis, and treatment of suppurative thrombophlebitis of peripheral and jugular veins and the superior and inferior vena cava will be reviewed here.

Most cases of intravenous catheter sepsis are not complicated by suppurative thrombophlebitis; in one series including 102 episodes, suppurative thrombophlebitis was observed in 7 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-septic-thrombophlebitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The incidence of peripheral vein suppurative thrombophlebitis is highest in patients with specific risk factors such as burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-septic-thrombophlebitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-septic-thrombophlebitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and injection drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-septic-thrombophlebitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Burn patients may be at particular risk due to several factors including high skin inoculum of organisms, hyperalimentation, use of broad spectrum antibiotics, and impairment of local defense due to loss of skin integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-septic-thrombophlebitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral vein suppurative thrombophlebitis should be suspected in patients with persistent bacteremia after 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, particularly in the setting of an intravascular catheter.

However, there are no controlled studies, and we decide on a case-by-case basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-septic-thrombophlebitis/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suppurative thrombophlebitis refers to venous thrombosis associated with inflammation in the setting of bacteremia. It should be suspected in patients with persistent bacteremia after 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, particularly in the setting of an intravascular catheter. Accompanying clinical manifestations may include fever, erythema, tenderness and purulent drainage at the site of the involved vessel. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of suppurative thrombophlebitis is made based on clinical manifestations, culture data and radiographic evidence of thrombosis. The principles of treatment for suppurative thrombophlebitis include removing the focus of infection (eg, intravenous catheter), prompt administration of intravenous antibiotics, and consideration regarding surgical intervention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anticoagulation. Once culture data are available, antibiotic therapy should be tailored to the organisms detected. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common cause of peripheral vein suppurative thrombophlebitis is <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>; streptococci and Enterobacteriaceae are also well-described pathogens. We suggest empiric antibiotic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> plus a third generation cephalosporin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The duration of therapy should be at least two weeks. In general, most favor surgical intervention only in the setting of ongoing sepsis or for patients who have not responded to antimicrobial therapy. We suggest <strong>not</strong> administering anticoagulation in the absence of evidence for extension of thrombus (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral vein'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The causative organisms of jugular vein suppurative thrombophlebitis are usually members of the normal oropharyngeal flora; the most common is <em>Fusobacterium necrophorum</em>. We suggest empiric antibiotic therapy with a beta-lactamase resistant beta-lactam antibiotic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The duration of therapy should be at least four weeks. In general, most favor surgical intervention only in the setting of ongoing sepsis or for patients who have not responded to antimicrobial therapy.

The duration of therapy should be at least four weeks. Surgical ligation is not possible for vena cava suppurative thrombophlebitis, although resection of the infected thrombus may be warranted if proximal thrombus propagation occurs despite antibiotic and anticoagulation therapy.
