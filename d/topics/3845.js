The overall frequency of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes is 1 in 5000, with EDS hypermobility type being by far the most common and some types being quite rare. The disorders are distinguished from one another and can often be diagnosed based upon the family history and clinical criteria, including the degree and nature of involvement of skin, joints, skeleton, and vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The genetic basis for most types of EDS has been defined, other than for the hypermobility type (that is likely genetically heterogeneous), and genetic testing may be useful diagnostically for several of these disorders.</p><p>The relationship between EDS, hypermobility type, and joint hypermobility syndrome remains uncertain; some experts have suggested that EDS, hypermobility type, and joint hypermobility syndrome may be manifestations of the same disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

A variety of different mutations that may cause an EDS phenotype have been identified for each of the affected genes.</p><p>Some forms of EDS are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, including the classic and vascular types, arthrochalasia, and most patients with the hypermobility type of EDS, thus requiring a single inherited copy of the abnormal gene for expression of the disease. Spontaneous mutations subsequently associated with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance may also occur. In other individuals and some rare types of EDS (eg, kyphoscoliosis EDS) the gene is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, with an altered copy from each parent present in those affected clinically.

The particular manifestations in the skin, joints, and other tissues, including the vasculature, depend upon the specific type of EDS that is present. Some features characteristic of one type may not be seen in patients with a different form of EDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>]. Consequently, the clinical diagnostic criteria for the different forms of EDS are distinct from one another. The utility of genetic testing for confirmation of the diagnosis also varies between types.</p><p>The diagnosis of EDS in one of its forms should be suspected when a patient presents with some combination of features seen in one or several of the types of EDS, including joint hypermobility, multiple joint dislocations, translucent skin, poor wound healing, easy bruising, and unusual scars. This diagnosis should also be considered in any young individual who experiences spontaneous rupture of an organ (eg, gut or uterus) or dissection of a major blood vessel. Referral to a clinical geneticist or other expert in EDS may be warranted for assistance in the diagnostic evaluation and management, particularly with respect to genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H19029204\" class=\"local\">'When to refer'</a> below.)</p><p>Joint dislocations or subluxations are common in most forms of EDS, and joint pain and premature degenerative arthritis are often consequences of the disorder. Pes planus is common in all forms, and pectus excavatum and a high arched palate can also be present in all of the forms of EDS. Musculoskeletal pain is common in patients with joint hypermobility, and complex regional pain syndrome has been described as a rare complication with both the hypermobility and classic forms of EDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The assessment of the joints is done using the <strong>Beighton hypermobility scale</strong>, which is widely used in assessing hypermobility of peripheral joints and the spine, and is the scoring system most often used in epidemiological research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. One point is awarded for the ability to perform each of four maneuvers involving the extremities (bilaterally), and one point is awarded for having an unusually flexible spine.

Small (more distal) joints, however, may exhibit mild hypermobility. The prevalence of the vascular form of EDS is not well studied, but estimates based upon available data suggest a frequency of at least 1 in 100,000, accounting for about 4 percent of all EDS cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].<br/><br/>Arterial rupture may involve the iliac, splenic, or renal arteries; or the aorta. Preexisting aneurysms are rarely detected prior to a rupture, as the aneurysms are typically pseudoaneurysms. Complications in affected individuals also include significant risk for spontaneous rupture of internal organs (such as the intestine and gravid uterus) and muscles. Maternal mortality during pregnancy is about 12 percent, although delivery is often uneventful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].<br/><br/>The skin is thin and may appear translucent with a prominent venous pattern (especially on the chest and abdomen), atrophic scars, increased bruisability, and varicosities. Wound dehiscence may occur postoperatively. However, the skin is only mildly hyperextensible. Minor trauma leads to extensive bruising.<br/><br/>Skeletal abnormalities include acrogeria, characterized by a lack of subcutaneous fat in the distal extremities; and a particular facial appearance with prominent eyes, thin face and nose, and lobeless ears. Gingival recession is common. Short stature may be seen but is not typical.

Kyphoscoliosis may be present at birth, and develops in nearly all patients. Progressive kyphoscoliosis can result in respiratory complications and often requires surgery. Patients with this form exhibit joint hypermobility and can experience recurrent joint dislocations. Osteoporosis can be seen, and clubfoot deformity may occur in about 30 percent. The skin is hyperextensible and typically velvety, pale, and translucent, with poor wound healing.

Hypermobility EDS may be difficult to distinguish from joint hypermobility syndrome, which is a much more common condition characterized by musculoskeletal pain and generalized joint hypermobility. Joint hypermobility syndrome is considered by many experts in rheumatology and in clinical genetics to be indistinguishable from, if not identical to, the most common variant of EDS, EDS-hypermobility type, but the precise relationship between EDS-hypermobility type and joint hypermobility syndrome remains uncertain and molecular genetic confirmation is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/2,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,45,46</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-hypermobility-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint hypermobility syndrome&quot;</a>) Several connective tissue disorders share some features with EDS, but clinically distinct features are typically also present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Joint dislocations or subluxations are common in most forms of EDS, and joint pain and premature degenerative arthritis are often consequences of the disorder. Other common features include pes planus, pectus excavatum, and a high arched palate. Musculoskeletal pain is common in patients with joint hypermobility. (See <a href=\"#H19029107\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9782837\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic EDS (EDS types I and II), the severity of which can vary, is characterized by skin hyperextensibility; widened atrophic scars; and both large and small joint hypermobility, which may decrease with age. Frequent and recurrent joint dislocations are common, osteoarthritis can develop, and scoliosis may be seen. The characteristic skin findings include velvety (&ldquo;doughy&rdquo;) hyperextensible and fragile skin, which extends easily and snaps back upon release, but may split easily with trauma; abnormal wound healing, with delayed healing and widened atrophic scars; and increased bruisability. Additional features include fatigue, development of hernias, cervical insufficiency and uterine prolapse, and rare vascular complications. Valvular heart disease is uncommon. The diagnosis can be confirmed by DNA sequencing of <em>COL5A1</em> and <em>COL5A2</em>. (See <a href=\"#H35121407\" class=\"local\">'Classic EDS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major features of hypermobility EDS (EDS type III) include large and small joint and spine hypermobility, which may lessen with age, and frequent joint dislocations. Chronic joint pain, which may resemble fibromyalgia, is common. Patients may also develop scoliosis and premature osteoarthritis. Skin is sometimes soft and smooth, but usually not to the degree seen in classic EDS, and only mild hyperextensibility is evident, if present. Wound healing is normal, without atrophic scars or evidence of skin or tissue fragility. Other features and complications include delayed gastric emptying, irritable bowel syndrome, and autonomic dysfunction. Aortic root dilatation and mitral valve prolapse are uncommon but can occur. Genetic testing for most patients with this form is not available, but a small subset of patients may have abnormalities in tenascin X DNA. (See <a href=\"#H33642561\" class=\"local\">'Hypermobility EDS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular EDS (EDS IV) is potentially life-threatening, and is characterized by increased risk of spontaneous vascular or visceral rupture and the absence of large joint hyperextensibility. Arterial rupture may involve the iliac, splenic, or renal arteries; or the aorta. Preexisting aneurysms are rarely detected prior to a rupture, as the aneurysms are typically pseudoaneurysms. There is significant risk for spontaneous rupture of internal organs (such as the intestine and gravid uterus) and muscles, and increased risk of maternal mortality during pregnancy. The skin is thin and may appear translucent with a prominent venous pattern, atrophic scars, increased bruisability, and varicosities, but is only mildly hyperextensible. Skeletal abnormalities may also be present. Substantial morbidity and mortality occurs by the fifth decade of life. The diagnosis can usually be confirmed by sequence and <span class=\"nowrap\">deletion/duplication</span> testing of the <em>COL3A1</em> gene. (See <a href=\"#H33642650\" class=\"local\">'Vascular EDS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional forms of EDS include kyphoscoliotic (EDS type VI), in which ocular involvement may be present, in addition to muscle hypotonia and joint laxity present at birth, kyphoscoliosis detected during infancy and other skeletal changes, and abnormal skin; arthrochalasia (EDS type VIIA and B), which is characterized by hypermobility with recurrent subluxations, congenital hip dislocations, extremity contractures, thoracolumbar scoliosis, short stature, muscle hypotonia, and frequent fractures; dermatosparaxis (EDS type VIIC), with severe skin fragility, sagging redundant skin, and large hernias; and other rare forms. (See <a href=\"#H33642797\" class=\"local\">'Kyphoscoliosis EDS'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28165406\" class=\"local\">'Arthrochalasia EDS'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28165620\" class=\"local\">'Dermatosparaxis EDS'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28165913\" class=\"local\">'Other rare forms of EDS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of each form of EDS includes the other EDS types and other connective tissue disorders with shared features, including Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and several other uncommon or rare disorders that can usually be distinguished clinically from EDS. Whether hypermobility EDS and joint hypermobility syndrome represent distinct entities or the same condition remains uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H28166141\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients suspected of having EDS based upon their clinical presentation and family history should be referred for consultation with an expert in clinical genetics or the care of patients with EDS for confirmation of the diagnosis and the institution of multidisciplinary management and follow-up care. The geneticist or other EDS expert can help to determine which, if any, genetic testing may be needed to assist in making or confirming the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H28166141\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Beighton P, De Paepe A, Steinmann B, et al.
