The results of ANA testing are reported in two parts: the titer of the antibodies and the staining pattern produced by the antibodies. The titer<em> </em>of the antibodies refers to the highest dilution of serum that produces visible fluorescence. The ANA pattern refers to the distribution of staining produced by autoantibodies reacting with antigens in the HEp-2 cell nucleus and cytoplasm. The measurement and clinical significance of ANA titer is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-and-clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement and clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unfortunately, there is limited agreement among laboratories as to which ANA staining patterns should be identified and reported to clinicians. The patterns to be reported are determined by individual laboratory directors. The directors also choose from among HEp-2 cell slides prepared by different companies. These companies may use different fixative and permeabilization techniques. Depending on the preparation of the HEp-2 cell substrate, some autoantibodies may or may not be detected by IIF. The clinician should know which staining patterns are recognized and reported by their reference laboratory.</p><p>An international workshop attempted to arrive at a consensus on the nomenclature of ANA staining patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibody-staining-patterns-and-associated-autoantibodies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The participants suggested that there are 11 staining patterns that &quot;must&quot; be reported by all &quot;competent-level&quot; laboratories. An additional 22 ANA staining patterns should be reported by &quot;expert-level&quot; laboratories. Whether or not the recommendations of the workshop will become widely accepted remains to be determined.</p><p>This topic review will cover three broad categories of ANA staining patterns: nuclear, cell cycle-associated, and cytoplasmic. Within each of these categories, individual patterns will be defined and autoantibodies that produce the staining patterns will be identified. The disease associations of autoantibodies producing the staining patterns will be described as well as additional laboratory tests that may be used to further characterize the autoantibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2522016586\"><span class=\"h1\">ANA STAINING PATTERNS INVOLVING THE NUCLEUS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2522016600\"><span class=\"h2\">Homogeneous</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Definition</strong> &ndash; The homogenous antinuclear antibody (ANA) pattern refers to diffuse staining of the nucleus in resting cells. There is also diffuse staining of the chromosome region in dividing cells. The homogenous staining pattern was reported in 36 percent of more than 9200 ANA-positive serum samples tested at the University Hospitals in Leuven, Belgium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibody-staining-patterns-and-associated-autoantibodies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Targets of antibodies</strong> &ndash; Histone proteins, double-stranded (ds)DNA, single-stranded DNA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disease association</strong> &ndash; Homogeneous nuclear staining may be seen in patients with many different systemic autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), drug-induced lupus, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome (SS), scleroderma (SSc), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as organ-specific autoimmune diseases including Hashimoto's thyroiditis, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and autoimmune hepatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Specific antibodies responsible for homogeneous staining, such as anti-dsDNA antibodies, may be detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using <em>Crithidia luciliae</em> assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or fluorescent bead assay and may be helpful to support the diagnosis of SLE. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are present in approximately 40 to 60 percent of patients with SLE and are highly specific for the disease (75 to 99 percent, depending on the assay used to detect the antibodies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibody-staining-patterns-and-associated-autoantibodies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Nucleoli may or may not be stained, depending on the specific autoantibody. Except for antibodies directed against Scl70 (topoisomerase I), there is no staining of the chromosome region in dividing cells. The fine nuclear speckled pattern was reported in 20 percent of more than 9200 ANA-positive serum samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibody-staining-patterns-and-associated-autoantibodies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Targets of antibodies</strong> &ndash; Ro60, La, Topoisomerase I (also known as Scl70), Ku, Mi-2, transcriptional intermediary factor (TIF)-1, and melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA-5; also known as CADM-140 and RNA helicase).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disease association</strong> &ndash; As is true with the homogeneous pattern, the fine speckled pattern may be present in patients with a broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases. Additional testing is required to further characterize the antibodies in patient serum that produce this staining pattern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Antibodies directed against Ro60 are present in approximately 75 percent of patients with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, 60 percent of patients with SS, 30 percent of patients with SLE, 30 percent of patients with PBC, 20 percent of patients with polymyositis (PM), and 15 percent of patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibody-staining-patterns-and-associated-autoantibodies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Anti-Ro60 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-Ro52 antibodies (see below) are present in nearly all women who have a child with neonatal lupus syndrome (NLS).

Because anti-Ro60 antibodies are not detected using some HEp-2 cell substrates, if anti-Ro60 is the only autoantibody present in a patient with SLE or SS, the patient will appear to have ANA-negative disease. Anti-Ro60 antibodies may be the only autoantibody present in 25 to 50 percent of all patients with &quot;ANA-negative&quot; SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibody-staining-patterns-and-associated-autoantibodies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Anti-DFS70 antibodies were found to be the only detectable autoantibody in only 1.1 percent of patients with SLE in a larger, international cohort. These results further suggest that anti-DFS70 autoantibodies are not associated with systemic rheumatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibody-staining-patterns-and-associated-autoantibodies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The results of ANA testing are reported in two parts: the titer of the antibodies and the staining pattern produced by the antibodies. The titer of the antibodies refers to the highest dilution of serum that produces visible fluorescence. The ANA pattern refers to the distribution of staining produced by autoantibodies reacting with antigens in the HEp-2 cell nucleus and cytoplasm. (See <a href=\"#H2522016580\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is limited agreement among laboratories as to which ANA staining patterns should be identified and reported to clinicians. The patterns to be reported are determined by individual laboratory directors. The directors also choose from among HEp-2 cell slides prepared by different companies, which may use different fixative and permeabilization techniques. Depending on the preparation of the HEp-2 cell substrate, some autoantibodies may or may not be detected by IIF. The clinician should know which staining patterns are recognized and reported by his or her reference laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H2522016580\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three broad categories of ANA staining patterns: nuclear, cell cycle-associated, and cytoplasmic. Within each of these categories there are individual staining patterns produced by specific autoantibodies. The disease associations, or lack thereof, for each of the staining patterns are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H2522016586\" class=\"local\">'ANA staining patterns involving the nucleus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2522016869\" class=\"local\">'Cell cycle-associated staining patterns'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2522017016\" class=\"local\">'Cytoplasmic staining patterns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ANA staining patterns involving the nucleus include homogeneous, nuclear speckled, nucleolar, nuclear dot, and nuclear envelope. Three types of nuclear speckled patterns (&quot;fine,&quot; &quot;coarse,&quot; and &quot;dense fine&quot;) have been described. Three types of nuclear dot staining patterns have been described: centromere, PML-Sp100 nuclear body, and Cajal body. (See <a href=\"#H2522016586\" class=\"local\">'ANA staining patterns involving the nucleus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2522016600\" class=\"local\">'Homogeneous'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2522016625\" class=\"local\">'Nuclear speckled'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2522016712\" class=\"local\">'Nucleolar'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2522016825\" class=\"local\">'Nuclear envelope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cell cycle-associated staining patterns include proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) pattern, centromere protein-F (CENP-F), and mitotic spindle apparatus. Two types of nuclear mitotic apparatus staining patterns have been described: nuclear mitotic apparatus-1 (NuMA1) and NuMa2. (See <a href=\"#H2522016869\" class=\"local\">'Cell cycle-associated staining patterns'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2522016876\" class=\"local\">'PCNA'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2522016908\" class=\"local\">'CENP-F'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2522016940\" class=\"local\">'Mitotic spindle apparatus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytoplasmic staining patterns include antimitochondrial antibody (AMA), cytoplasmic fine speckled, cytoskeletal staining, Golgi apparatus, and rods and rings.
