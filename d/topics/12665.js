The primary approaches to the treatment of brain metastases include surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT).</p><p>Treatment of brain metastases has become increasingly individualized as surgical and radiosurgical techniques have evolved over the past several decades, and as improved systemic therapies have begun to offer greater potential for both systemic and intracranial disease control for certain cancer types and genotypes.</p><p>While WBRT remains the primary treatment modality for patients with a high intracranial tumor burden, the routine role of WBRT as adjunctive therapy in patients who are candidates for SRS or surgical resection has evolved as randomized trials have shown that despite improved rates of intracranial disease control, adjunctive WBRT does not improve overall survival and may decrease quality of life due to side effects and neurocognitive decline. The role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is reviewed separately.

In randomized trials composed primarily of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer, the median survival in patients treated with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) ranges from four to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>More prolonged survival is seen in selected patients and in certain subgroups, such as patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer and certain genotypes of NSCLC.

Three prognostic classes were identified and the outcome correlated with median survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77561\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77561 \">table 2</a>).

The DS-GPA is based upon an analysis of nearly 4000 patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases treated between 1985 and 2007. Multivariate analysis using the same criteria as in the RPA analysis, plus the primary diagnosis, led to the establishment of separate criteria for patients with NSCLC, SCLC, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and gastrointestinal cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65322\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65322 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Significant prognostic factors in this model included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung cancer &ndash; Age, Karnofsky performance score, presence of extracranial metastases, and number of brain metastases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melanoma &ndash; Karnofsky performance score and number of brain metastases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal cell carcinoma &ndash; Karnofsky performance score and number of brain metastases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast cancer &ndash; Karnofsky performance score, subtype (based upon estrogen <span class=\"nowrap\">receptor/progesterone</span> receptor, HER2 status), and age</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal cancers &ndash; Karnofsky performance score</p><p/><p>For each of these disease categories, there was a statistically significant survival gradient with improvement in overall survival with a better DS-GPA score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65322\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65322 \">table 3</a>). These criteria provide improved prognostic information that may be useful patient management as well as clinical trials.</p><p>Additional prognostic instruments for patients with brain metastases from melanoma are reviewed separately.

Key components include the control of peritumoral edema and increased intracranial pressure with corticosteroids, the treatment of seizures, and the management of venous thromboembolic disease. These issues are discussed elsewhere.

The selection of initial therapy depends largely on the number and size of brain metastases.</p><p>The approaches outlined below are generally consistent with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations for the treatment of patients with brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H681013407\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of underlying histology and systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As improved systemic therapies have begun to offer greater potential for both systemic and intracranial disease control for certain cancer types and genotypes, the management of brain metastases has become increasingly individualized. While surgery and radiation remain the mainstays of treatment in most patients, all therapies should be considered in the context of the underlying histology, systemic disease status, and availability of systemic therapies with potential for intracranial disease control.</p><p>In particular, patients with brain metastases from melanoma, breast cancer, and certain genotypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (eg, activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor [<em>EGFR</em>] gene, translocations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase [<em>ALK</em>] gene) are optimally treated in a multidisciplinary fashion and may be eligible for clinical trials for novel or existing systemic therapies.

In the randomized trial that first showed a survival advantage to surgical resection plus whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) over biopsy plus WBRT for single brain metastases, 11 percent of screened patients had an alternative diagnosis at the time of biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2201428812\"><span class=\"h3\">Large tumor or diagnostic uncertainty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with a single, surgically accessible metastasis that is large or associated with significant edema and mass effect, surgical resection achieves rapid symptom relief and local control. In carefully selected patients, resection has been shown to improve survival and decrease the risk of neurologic death compared with a radiation-alone approach. (See <a href=\"#H1185398394\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Surgery (or stereotactic biopsy, for poorly accessible tumors) is also favored for single lesions when there is uncertainty regarding the histologic diagnosis, either based on clinical grounds (eg, cancer history is remote, primary tumor is not known to be metastatic or rarely spreads to brain) or radiographic findings (eg, prominent diffusion restriction raising suspicion for abscess or heterogenous, irregularly shaped centrally necrotic mass lesion suggestive of malignant glioma). For such lesions that are surgically inaccessible, stereotactic biopsy may be indicated to guide further therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain metastases&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1185398394\"><span class=\"h4\">Efficacy of surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advances in neuroanesthesia and neurosurgery have significantly improved the safety of surgical resection of brain metastases, making this approach applicable to a larger number of patients, including lesions in both eloquent and noneloquent regions of the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>Three randomized clinical trials have compared surgery plus WBRT with WBRT alone in patients with single brain metastases. Two of these demonstrated a survival benefit and provided an indication of those patients who can benefit from this combined approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/12,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15,16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first trial, 48 patients with a single brain metastasis were treated with either surgical resection followed by WBRT or WBRT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients whose treatment included surgery had significantly fewer local recurrences (20 versus 52 percent), significantly improved survival (40 versus 15 weeks), and had a better quality of life. Factors that correlated significantly with increased survival in addition to surgical treatment were the absence of extracranial disease, longer time to the development of the brain metastasis, and younger age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the second trial of 63 patients with a single brain metastasis, the overall survival with surgery and WBRT was significantly longer (10 versus 6 months), and patients remained functionally independent for a longer period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The benefit from surgery was seen primarily in patients with stable extracranial disease (median survival 12 months). Patients with active extracranial disease had a median survival of only five months and did not appear to benefit from surgery. Survival was shorter in patients older than 60 years of age compared with younger patients.</p><p/><p>Although the third trial did not show improved outcomes, a survival benefit in favorable prognosis patients may have been missed because patients with a lower Karnofsky performance score at baseline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77561\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77561 \">table 2</a>) were included and a higher proportion of cases had extracranial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>In patients treated with surgery, postoperative radiation is generally indicated to improve local control.

Nevertheless, hospitalization time tends to be relatively short (less than five days), and one-month neurologic outcomes are either stable or improved in approximately 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The risk of permanent paresis with surgery is estimated to be approximately 8 to 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>].

Patients who remain seizure free can then be tapered off of the antiseizure drug, typically after the first postoperative week. The risk of seizures and the use of perioperative antiseizure drugs is discussed elsewhere.

Postoperative WBRT reduces the risk of both local and distant failure at other sites in the brain by more than half but does not improve overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; in addition, WBRT is associated with fatigue, alopecia, and an increased risk of neurocognitive impairment that may reduce quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H2457905314\" class=\"local\">'Role of adjunctive WBRT'</a> below.) </p><p>Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the surgical cavity has become the preferred alternative to postoperative WBRT in most patients. This practice is supported by observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/24-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-34</a>] as well as two randomized trials showing that postoperative SRS decreases the risk of neurocognitive decline compared with WBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and improves local control compared with observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter cooperative group trial, 194 patients with resected brain metastases were randomly assigned to postoperative SRS (12 to 20 Gy in a single fraction depending on cavity volume) or WBRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions or 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. At six months, patients assigned to SRS had a lower risk of cognitive deterioration compared with those who were assigned to WBRT (52 versus 85 percent) and similar median overall survival (12.2 versus 11.6 months). Notably, SRS was associated with worse rates of surgical site control (80 versus 87 percent at 6 months and 61 versus 81 percent at 12 months) as well as overall intracranial control (55 versus 81 percent at 6 months) compared with WBRT. One possible explanation for the relatively high rate of local recurrence after SRS seen in this trial is that 40 percent of cavities were wider than 3 cm and thereby received a lower single fraction dose, which may have been insufficient to control microscopic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second randomized single-center trial compared postoperative SRS (12 to 16 Gy in a single fraction) with observation in 132 patients who underwent complete resection of one to three brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. With a median follow-up of 11 months, local control rates were higher for SRS compared with observation (85 versus 66 percent at 6 months and 72 versus 43 percent at 12 months), and median overall survival was similar (17 versus 18 months). In patients treated with SRS, the most important risk factor for local recurrence was preoperative tumor diameter &gt;2.5 cm.</p><p/><p>Dose and fractionation of focal radiation is tailored based on factors such as size of the cavity, location, and underlying histology. Single fraction SRS can be used for small cavities (eg, &lt;3 cm in diameter), whereas multiple fraction (hypofractionated) SRS may offer better local control rates for larger cavities and preoperative tumor size &gt;2.5 cm while minimizing the risk of radiation necrosis. Low-dose cesium-131 cavitary brachytherapy is also being explored as a potential alternative to SRS for large resected metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2222087942\" class=\"local\">'Complications of SRS'</a> below.) </p><p>The risk of distant recurrence in the brain remains unaddressed by focal radiation, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed every two to three months after completion of radiation to monitor for recurrent disease. In the trials reviewed above, the rate of salvage WBRT in patients treated with SRS alone ranged from 20 to 38 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/23,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1863934740\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance after initial therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2631668422\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3059192309\"><span class=\"h3\">Small or inaccessible tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SRS is a reasonable alternative to surgery or WBRT for small tumors that are not surgically accessible. Of note, neurotoxicity and local failure after SRS increase with increasing lesion size, and thus consideration of SRS rather than surgery should generally be limited to lesions with a diameter of 3 cm or less. (See <a href=\"#H3596579841\" class=\"local\">'Limited number of tumors, all &lt;3 cm'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with single brain metastases who are equally appropriate candidates for surgery and SRS, the choice should be individualized. No randomized trials have been conducted comparing SRS alone with surgery plus postoperative radiation. &#160;</p><p>Much of the comparative data supporting the use of SRS for single brain metastases have come from reports in which SRS was used in conjunction with WBRT. Only observational studies, which are of limited value as they may be biased by how patients were assigned to surgery or SRS, are available.

Most of the evidence consists of case reports and small case series, however, and the role, if any, of sequence and timing of therapy in relation to SRS is not well understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

In a separate study of 137 patients with melanoma brain metastases, all of whom received immunotherapy (mostly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>), the rate of radiation necrosis was 27 percent at a median of six months after SRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

The rationale for this approach is that the hippocampus contains a neural stem cell niche that is important to memory function and potentially quite radiosensitive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation#H4143597\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.) </p><p>In a multicenter phase II study sponsored by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Trials Group (RTOG 0933), 113 patients with brain metastases from a nonhematologic cancer other than SCLC were treated with hippocampal-avoidance WBRT delivered to a dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

In 42 evaluable patients, the mean relative decline in HVLT-R DR from baseline to four months was 7 percent (95% CI -4.7 to 18.7 percent).

The probability of HVLT-R total recall (HVLT-R TR) deterioration at four months was 19 percent. This also compared favorably with a previous randomized trial of WBRT with or without SRS, in which the probability of HVLT-R TR deterioration at four months was 24 percent in those treated with SRS alone and 52 percent in those treated with WBRT plus SRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Only 3 of 67 patients with intracranial progression (4.5 percent) progressed within the hippocampal avoidance area.</p><p>Although these findings are encouraging, they represent results of a single-arm trial, with all of the limitations of a historic comparison. In particular, median overall survival in the trial was superior to prior trials, making it difficult to exclude improved survivorship as an explanation for the apparent improvement in neurocognitive performance. Based on these findings, two cooperative group randomized phase III trials are planned. Confirmatory results from these trials are needed before the additional cost of hippocampal-avoidance WBRT can be justified on a routine basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3749911100\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH POOR PERFORMANCE STATUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aggressive treatment for brain metastases in patients with a poor prognosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poor performance status generally is not warranted.
