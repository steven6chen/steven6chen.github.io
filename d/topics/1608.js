The most important contributing factor for AWR is underdosing of anesthetic agents relative to the patient's specific requirements. Although the incidence of AWR may be reduced with preventive measures, it may not be eradicated completely. Thus, all patients undergoing general anesthesia should be informed that AWR is rare, but can occur.</p><p>This topic will discuss the risk factors, sequelae, and prevention of AWR after general anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Awareness experiences range from isolated auditory perceptions to reports of a patient being fully awake, immobilized, and in pain. Incidence of AWR varies widely due to methodological differences in postoperative assessment of awareness and differences in anesthetic practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although the most common outcome measured is postoperative recall for the awareness event, intraoperative consciousness and explicit recall of intraoperative events may be dissociated from each other. In one study, only one in four patients with evidence of intraoperative awareness had explicit postoperative recall of the event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Large, prospective, multicenter studies of AWR in adult patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia have reported an incidence of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/1000</span> in North America and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. Studies with prospective patient interviews that specifically inquire about awareness have noted an incidence of 0.1 to 0.2 percent in the general population and approximately 1 percent in high-risk populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/3,4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7,8</a>]. The fifth National Audit Project (NAP-5) in the United Kingdom was a very large retrospective study that did not include patient interviews; the reported incidence was 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 19,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. This probably reflects under-detection since patients were not interviewed to assess AWR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In children, the incidence of AWR after general anesthesia is slightly higher, between 0.2 to 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Pooled data from a combined sample of five cohort studies involving 4486 pediatric anesthetics revealed 33 cases of awareness. Assessing the presence of AWR in children, however, poses a number of challenges related to developmental factors and the accuracy of postoperative interviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1638986384\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may not talk to their physicians about AWR unless specifically asked; therefore, an explicit query about AWR in the immediate postoperative period and during the anesthesiologist's follow-up visit is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Further evaluation should be performed if AWR is suspected, and psychological support is offered and arranged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/3,4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,17</a>].</p><p>Psychological symptoms occur in 33 to 69 percent of adult patients who experience AWR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/3,4,15,16,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,15,16,18-22</a>]. Many cases of AWR involve only a fleeting recollection of intraoperative events and do not cause significant anxiety or stress. Other experiences can be vivid and traumatic, with long-term psychological consequences, particularly if a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) is used (see <a href=\"#H849685387\" class=\"local\">'Neuromuscular blockade'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. An early emotional response after an awareness event is a risk factor for later development of post-event psychological disturbances; the most serious is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/16,17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,23</a>]. Distressing AWR experiences are more likely to cause psychological sequelae.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of an AWR experience may be delayed. After the patient is discharged from the hospital, both the surgeon and primary care physician should be vigilant in identifying potential early signs of a psychological disturbance (eg, intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, recurrent dreams or nightmares, avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, sleep disturbance, exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance). Counseling is offered if AWR is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

This can occur for the following reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anesthetic technique results in inadequate anesthesia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A specific patient's needs are underappreciated.

Different doses of anesthetic agent are required to achieve these anesthetic effects. For example, amnesia typically occurs at a lower anesthetic dose than that required for hypnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Total intravenous anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is probably associated with a higher risk for AWR compared with techniques based on a volatile inhalation agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. A survey of 172 anesthesiologists who had performed 85,156 anesthetics in Japan noted reports of 24 patients who had definite (n = 14) or possible (n = 10) AWR. TIVA had been used in 88 percent of the patients who reported AWR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, the majority of the 85,156 patients included in the survey received volatile anesthetic agents rather than TIVA alone.</p><p>In contrast to inhalation anesthesia, for which the exhaled concentration of the anesthetic agents allows real-time dose adjustments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], blood concentrations of intravenous agents are not easily obtained during TIVA, which may lead to underdosing (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'End-tidal anesthetic concentration'</a> below). While developing technology may allow the prediction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> concentrations in serum by determining the propofol concentration in exhaled air, these methods are not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Detection of AWR with a TIVA technique has relied primarily on patient response to noxious stimuli to indicate insufficient anesthetic depth. However, if a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) is administered, movement may be prevented. Neuromonitoring may improve the ability to ensure that general anesthesia has produced unconsciousness in such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/31,32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,34</a>] (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Neuromonitoring'</a> below). In a randomized study of 5228 patients undergoing TIVA, AWR was significantly lower in patients who received bispectral index (BIS)-guided monitoring to a target of 40 to 60, compared with a control group in which BIS monitoring was performed by the investigator but was not made available to the anesthesiologist (0.14 versus 0.65 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H849685387\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuromuscular blockade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of an NMBA is associated with increased risk and severity of AWR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/3,10,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,24</a>]. The fifth National Audit Project (NAP-5) in the United Kingdom findings confirmed a higher incidence of AWR when an NMBA was administered (approximately 1 in 8200) compared with no NMBA (approximately 1 in 135,900) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Studies in awake volunteers who did not receive any anesthetic agent demonstrated that BIS values suggesting an anesthetic depth appropriate for surgery were present in some individuals shortly after administration of a dose of NMBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Muscle paralysis removes one of the physiologic signs of patient awareness (ie, purposeful movement). Since complete paralysis worsens the psychological trauma of an AWR experience, the potential for long-term psychological sequelae may be increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/7,17,24,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17,24,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistance or tolerance to anesthetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have a history of AWR may be at higher risk for future events. One observational study noted an adjusted fivefold higher incidence in patients with a previous AWR event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Genetic variations might result in resistance to the hypnotic or amnesic actions of certain anesthetic agents, although such variations have not yet been identified in humans.</p><p>Acquired tolerance to anesthetic agents may occur. Cytochrome P450 2E1 is induced by alcohol and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Since the inhalation agents, benzodiazepines, and opioids are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, patients with habitual alcohol intake may require higher doses of these agents. However, acute alcohol intoxication is associated with a decreased inhalation anesthesia requirement. Details regarding recognition and perioperative management of excessive alcohol use are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-management-of-unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-the-perioperative-period\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and management of unhealthy alcohol use in the perioperative period&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Frequent use of opioids or benzodiazepines induces tolerance with an increased requirement for agents in these classes (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescription-drug-misuse-epidemiology-prevention-identification-and-management#H29429864\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management&quot;, section on 'Opioid analgesics'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescription-drug-misuse-epidemiology-prevention-identification-and-management#H29429944\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management&quot;, section on 'Sedatives-hypnotics'</a>). Also, several prescription and nonprescription drugs induce cytochrome P450 3A (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a>, barbiturates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, rifampicin, and St. John's wort), which is involved in the metabolism of opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Chronic administration of these drugs may increase opioid dosing requirements in the perioperative period. Inadequate analgesia during a surgical procedure results in a higher level of cortical stimulation due to pain, and may increase risk of AWR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Type of surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical procedures with higher risk for AWR include trauma or cardiac surgery and cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/7,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,24,25</a>]. Underdosing of general anesthetic agents during these procedures is not infrequent because of a focus on maintaining adequate blood pressure (BP) and limiting adverse consequences of hemodynamic instability. When such procedures are emergent, a contributing factor may be the very short time interval between anesthetic induction and surgical incision (eg, for control of hemorrhage or immediate delivery of a neonate).</p><p>Difficulty with intubation in any surgical procedure may lead to AWR, presumably due to insufficient anesthesia during prolonged intubation attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385073122\"><span class=\"h2\">Technical issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Equipment malfunction and human error are infrequent causes of AWR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Also, use of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) eliminates purposeful movement as a sign of AWR. (See <a href=\"#H849685387\" class=\"local\">'Neuromuscular blockade'</a> above.)</p><p>Hemodynamic parameters are also unreliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although tachycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension may reflect insufficient anesthetic depth, patients with hypovolemia or significant beta-adrenergic blockade often exhibit little response to a noxious stimulus.

The MAC requirement for movement suppression (mediated at the level of the spinal cord) is usually higher than MAC for suppression of consciousness (ie, MAC-awake) or memory (ie, MAC-amnesia), which provides a margin of safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Also, use of inhalation agents with low blood solubility (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>) allows relatively rapid adjustments in anesthetic concentration and corresponding anesthetic depth.</p><p>While ETAC &lt;0.7 MAC for the selected anesthetic agent has been proposed as an appropriate alarm threshold level, it is not known whether hypnosis and amnesia will be consistently achieved at concentrations &ge;0.7 MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/26,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,44,45</a>].

However, unprocessed EEG monitoring is susceptible to artifact, is not available in all operating rooms, and is unfamiliar to many anesthesiologists, rendering its use less practical than processed EEG technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia/abstract/56,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When a patient is awake, the raw EEG typically has lower-power, higher-frequency beta activity (ie, 20 to 30 Hz), and does not have persistent spindles in theta (4 to 8 Hz) or alpha (8 to 12 Hz) frequencies. The raw EEG waveform during general anesthesia varies depending on the classes and combinations of anesthetic agents administered. With administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> or a volatile inhalation anesthetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>) at general anesthetic concentrations, the EEG waveform typically has a slow delta pattern (0 to 4 Hz) often coinciding with persistent spindles in theta or alpha frequencies.

Patients are specifically queried regarding AWR in the immediate postoperative period and during the anesthesiologist's follow-up visits. (See <a href=\"#H1638986384\" class=\"local\">'Identification and management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3609908261\" class=\"local\">'Manage patient expectations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative awareness events occur more frequently than postoperative recall of these events. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-third to two-thirds of patients with AWR develop psychological sequelae. Early recognition is necessary so that support and psychological counseling may be provided. (See <a href=\"#H1638986384\" class=\"local\">'Identification and management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthetic underdosing is the major risk factor for AWR. This is more likely to occur with a total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) technique, administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA), patient history of possible resistance or tolerance to anesthetic agents, certain types of surgery (eg, trauma, cardiac, cesarean delivery), and technical or equipment issues. (See <a href=\"#H991752812\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors: Anesthetic underdosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We avoid or minimize dosing of NMBAs whenever possible to avoid complete paralysis. NMBAs interfere with ability to detect AWR and may increase risk of long-term psychological sequelae if AWR occurs. (See <a href=\"#H849685387\" class=\"local\">'Neuromuscular blockade'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing general anesthesia with inhalation agents, we suggest continuous monitoring of end-tidal anesthetic concentration (ETAC) to assess whether the anesthetic dose is close to the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) value for the selected agent, with alarms set to detect low ETAC concentration (eg, &lt;0.7 MAC). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'End-tidal anesthetic concentration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing general anesthesia with TIVA, we suggest neuromonitoring of the processed or unprocessed electroencephalogram (EEG), with alarms set to detect high EEG indices that indicate possible awareness (eg, BIS value &gt;60) rather than no monitoring, particularly if a NMBA was administered. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Neuromonitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients at high risk for AWR, we suggest ETAC monitoring if an inhalation agent is used, as well as neuromonitoring of the processed or unprocessed EEG, with alarms set to detect low ETAC concentration (eg, &lt;0.7 MAC) or high EEG indices (eg, BIS value &gt;60), rather than no monitoring.
