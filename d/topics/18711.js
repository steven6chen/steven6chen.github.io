This is a problem, because the body needs vitamin D to absorb calcium and for other important jobs.</p><p>People who do not have enough vitamin D can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have weak or soft bones, which can break easily or change in shape</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have weak muscles, which makes them more likely to fall</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396264\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for vitamin D deficiency?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can do a blood test to see if you have enough vitamin D. But you might not need this test. Doctors measure vitamin D levels only in people who are at risk for a vitamin D deficiency. This includes people who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spend most or all of their time indoors (for example, because they are in a nursing home)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have medical problems (such as Celiac disease) that make it hard for them to absorb vitamin D</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a condition called &quot;osteoporosis,&quot; which makes bones weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Broke a bone too easily, such as by falling down</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396271\"><span class=\"h1\">What foods and drinks have vitamin D?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foods and drinks that have a lot of vitamin D include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78586\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78586 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milk, orange juice, or yogurt with vitamin D added</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cooked salmon or mackerel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Canned tuna fish</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cereals with vitamin D added</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cod liver oil</p><p/><p>People's bodies can also get vitamin D from the sun. The body uses sunlight that shines on the skin to make vitamin D.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396278\"><span class=\"h1\">What are supplements?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplements are pills, capsules, or liquids that have nutrients in them. Supplements are another way people can get vitamin D.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396285\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to take vitamin D supplements?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experts recommend that most adults take supplements that have 600 to 800 international units of vitamin D a day. People who do not get enough vitamin D from their food or from the sun might need to take even more.</p><p>If your doctor recommends that you take vitamin D supplements, ask him or her which type, how much, and when to take the supplements.</p><p>The type and dose of supplement that is right for you will depend on your medical problems and the other medicines you take.</p><p>It is important not to take too much vitamin D. Taking too much vitamin D can make you sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396346\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-for-babies-and-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vitamin D for babies and children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vitamin D deficiency (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
