Cervical cancer is a treatable condition, and there is a good chance of cure if it is found and treated in the early or precancerous stages.</p><p>Many women with cervical cancer are in their reproductive years. Advice regarding options for fertility preservation for women with early-stage cervical cancer is available from clinicians who are experts in reproductive endocrinology and infertility, in conjunction with a gynecologic oncologist.</p><p>This topic review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of women with the earliest stages of localized cervical cancer who wish to preserve their ability to become pregnant in the future. Separate topic reviews discuss screening for cervical cancer and the standard treatment of all early-stage cervical cancers (which usually includes hysterectomy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-treatment-early-stage-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer treatment; early-stage cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23603883\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENT DECISIONS REGARDING FERTILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A woman with cervical cancer who wishes to preserve her fertility may feel that she has to choose between doing what seems best for her own life and what might be best for preserving fertility. Every woman's circumstances are different, and every decision must be individualized based upon the woman's situation. Advice regarding options for fertility preservation is available from clinicians who are experts in reproductive endocrinology and infertility, in conjunction with a gynecologic oncologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL CANCER FERTILITY-SPARING TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early-stage cervical cancer refers to stage IA1, IA2, IB1, and some small IIA1 tumors. Options for preservation of fertility are usually limited to women with stages IA1, IA2, or IB1 cervical cancer. Factors such as tumor size, tumor cell type, lymphovascular space invasion, and lymph node metastases may also affect the ability to receive fertility-sparing treatment.</p><p>Options for treatment of early-stage cervical cancer include cone biopsy, hysterectomy, and chemoradiation. Future pregnancies are not possible after hysterectomy or radiation therapy. Some women with early-stage cervical cancer with no spread to other organs or lymph nodes who wish to carry a pregnancy after cervical cancer treatment are eligible for less aggressive forms of treatment. Treatments that allow a woman to carry a pregnancy at a later time include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conization &ndash; Large biopsy of the cervix</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simple trachelectomy &ndash; More extensive removal of the cervix</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radical trachelectomy &ndash; Removal of the cervix and surrounding tissues, but not the uterus </p><p/><p>In addition, removal of the lymph nodes in the pelvis is performed except in women with stage IA1 disease without cancer cells in the lymphatic channels.</p><p>Sentinel node biopsy is increasingly performed to reduce the extent of and complications associated with extensive lymph node dissection. However, this procedure is not yet considered &quot;standard of care&quot; but it can be considered and performed by surgeons experienced with the technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical conization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical conization is the surgical removal of a cone-shaped portion of the cervix, including the cancerous area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63427\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63427 \">figure 1</a>). It is an acceptable option only for the earliest stages of cervical cancer (ie, stage IA1 and IA2).</p><p>Conization is usually performed in the operating room after the woman receives anesthesia. Conization is performed through the vagina. Most women can go home the same day.</p><p>Following conization, most gynecologic oncologists recommend that the woman avoid sexual intercourse, not place anything in the vagina, and not take a bath or swim for a few weeks (showers are fine); these activities could potentially interfere with healing. Some bleeding is expected, although it should not be heavy. If bleeding becomes heavy (eg, soaks a pad in less than an hour) or continues for more than one week, the woman should contact her health care provider.</p><p>After conization, follow-up examinations are recommended to ensure that there is no evidence of cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-treatment-early-stage-cancer-beyond-the-basics#H14\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer treatment; early-stage cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1756474990\"><span class=\"h2\">Simple trachelectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some data suggest that &quot;radical&quot; trachelectomy may not always be necessary in patients with small lesions as the risk of cancer spread to the tissues next to the uterus and cervix (parametrium) is extremely low. The simple trachelectomy is similar to the radical trachelectomy in that it involves the &quot;en bloc&quot; removal of most of the cervix but it does not include the removal of the parametrial tissue. It is, however, more extensive than a conization. It is an acceptable option for stage IA1, IA2, and small IB1 lesions measuring &lt;2 cm. It is performed in the operating room, through the vagina, and is usually a day surgery like a conization. A cerclage is not necessarily placed after the simple trachelectomy. It depends on the amount of cervical tissue remaining after the procedure. A laparoscopy for removal of the lymph nodes is performed prior to the trachelectomy to make sure cancer cells have not spread to the lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-early-stage-cervical-cancer-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Radical trachelectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radical trachelectomy is defined as partial or complete surgical removal of the cervix and parametrium (connective tissues next to the uterus and cervix). Radical trachelectomy removes much more of the cervix compared to cervical conization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50693 \">figure 2</a>). It also involves the removal of lymph nodes in the pelvis.</p><p>The procedure is performed in the operating room after the woman receives anesthesia. Trachelectomy may be done through the vagina or through an incision on the abdomen, depending upon the surgeon's preference. The procedure may also be performed using laparoscopy or robotic surgery. The cervix and upper portion of the vagina may be completely or partially removed, depending upon the size and depth of the cancer. A permanent purse-string suture (cerclage) is usually placed at the lower end of the uterus or remaining cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50693 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Before trachelectomy begins, surgical removal of lymph nodes within the pelvis is performed to be sure that the cancer has not spread; this is called lymphadenectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77184\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77184 \">figure 3</a>). The nodes may be removed through an incision in the abdomen (if an abdominal incision is made for the trachelectomy), which allows the clinician to see the nodes directly. Alternately, the nodes are removed with the assistance of a laparoscope if the trachelectomy is done vaginally, laparoscopically, or robotically.</p><p>After removal, the lymph nodes are examined under a microscope during the operation to preliminarily confirm that cervical cancer cells are absent (frozen section analysis). If any nodes are found to contain cancer cells, trachelectomy is not performed, and more aggressive therapy (radical hysterectomy or chemoradiotherapy) is usually recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-treatment-early-stage-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer treatment; early-stage cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following trachelectomy, most gynecologic oncologists recommend that the woman avoid sexual intercourse, not place anything in the vagina, and not take a bath or swim for four to six weeks (showers are fine); these activities could potentially interfere with healing. Some bleeding is expected for approximately one week, although it should not be heavy. If bleeding becomes heavy (eg, soaks a pad in less than an hour) or continues for more than one week, the woman should contact her health care provider.</p><p>After trachelectomy, follow-up examinations and testing are recommended to ensure that there is no evidence of cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-treatment-early-stage-cancer-beyond-the-basics#H14\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer treatment; early-stage cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Need for further treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further surgery may be required if abnormal or cancerous cells are found at the margins (edges) of the area that is surgically removed during conization or trachelectomy. For a woman who had conization, this could mean a second conization, radical trachelectomy, or hysterectomy. For a woman who had radical trachelectomy, this usually means a radical hysterectomy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-treatment-early-stage-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer treatment; early-stage cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). Additional chemoradiation may be necessary if cancer cells are identified in the lymph nodes on final pathology or if other risk factors are identified on the trachelectomy specimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY AFTER CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women are advised to wait 6 to 12 months after conization or trachelectomy before attempting to become pregnant to allow the tissue to heal fully. Even if a woman waits to attempt pregnancy, there is a risk of pregnancy complications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infertility after cervical cancer treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Infertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an increased risk of difficulty in becoming pregnant if the cervix or lower uterus becomes scarred or narrowed as a result of the conization or radical trachelectomy. This could potentially prevent sperm from entering the uterus. This can usually be overcome with an infertility treatment, such as intrauterine insemination (IUI), following attempts at dilating the cervical opening. With IUI, a small catheter is used to deliver sperm directly into the uterus. If dilating the cervical opening is impossible or if IUI fails, in vitro fertilization with embryo transfer can be attempted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical insufficiency occurs when the cervix opens or thins earlier than normal during pregnancy. This can lead to miscarriage or preterm delivery (when delivery occurs before 37 weeks of pregnancy). Women who have had cervical conization or radical trachelectomy may be at an increased risk of cervical insufficiency.</p><p>For these reasons, women who undergo treatment for cervical cancer are followed closely during pregnancy. This generally involves regular monitoring of the length and opening (dilation) of the cervix. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-beyond-the-basics#H10\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Preterm labor (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Cervical length'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy options after radical hysterectomy or radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not usually possible to become pregnant or carry a pregnancy after treatment with radical hysterectomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemoradiation therapy. However, advances in assisted reproductive technology may offer a way for women to have a biologically related child after this type of treatment.</p><p>Embryo cryopreservation is a technique that has been available for many years for fertility preservation. Embryo cryopreservation requires that radical surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy is delayed for several weeks, and that a partner's or donor's sperm is available. Thus, it may not be an option for all women. To use embryo cryopreservation, a woman must use fertility medications and undergo a surgical procedure to harvest her oocytes (eggs). The oocyte is then combined with a partner's or donor's sperm to create an embryo. The embryo is then frozen for use at a later time.</p><p>Another option is oocyte cryopreservation (freezing the egg before it is fertilized with sperm). Ovarian cryopreservation (freezing the ovary) is under investigation; further study is needed before this technique is available to the general public.</p><p>Since the uterus has been removed or damaged by cancer treatment, all of these techniques, including embryo cryopreservation, would require a gestational carrier to carry the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surrogate-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surrogate pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL TRIALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progress in treating cervical cancer requires that better treatments be identified through clinical trials, which are conducted all over the world. A clinical trial is a carefully controlled way to study the effectiveness of new treatments or new combinations of known therapies.
