The spectrum of clinical manifestations of HBV infection varies in both acute and chronic disease. During the acute phase, manifestations range from subclinical hepatitis to anicteric hepatitis, icteric hepatitis, and fulminant hepatitis; during the chronic phase, manifestations range from an asymptomatic carrier state to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical outcome of HBV infection depends upon the age at infection, the level of HBV replication, and the immune status of the host. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will discuss the characteristics of the hepatitis B virus and the pathogenesis of HBV-related liver disease. The immune response to HBV contributes to the hepatic injury, helps control the infection, and provides the means for establishing the serologic diagnosis of HBV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis B virus belongs to the family of hepadnaviruses, which include duck hepatitis virus, woodchuck hepatitis virus, and ground squirrel hepatitis virus. The complete virion or Dane particle is 42 nm in diameter. It consists of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An envelope composed of viral-encoded proteins and host-derived lipid components</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A core particle made up of the nucleocapsid protein, the viral genome, and the polymerase protein</p><p/><p>HBV also produces 22 nm subviral particles in the form of filaments and spheres that are composed of envelope proteins only. These subviral particles do not contain the HBV genome and are therefore noninfectious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The genome of HBV is a relaxed circular, partially double stranded DNA of approximately 3200 base pairs in length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are four partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the envelope <span class=\"nowrap\">(pre-S/S),</span> core <span class=\"nowrap\">(precore/core),</span> polymerase, and X proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">pre-S/S</span> ORF consists of three in-phase start codons and a common stop codon that divides the gene into pre-S1, pre-S2 and S regions encoding the large (L), middle (M), and small (S) envelope proteins, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74116 \">figure 1</a>). The M and S envelope proteins are found in all forms of viral and subviral particles while the L envelope proteins are predominantly found in complete virions.</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">precore/core</span> ORF consists of two in-phase start codons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61295 \">figure 2</a>). Translation from the precore start codon produces a precore polypeptide which is posttranslationally modified into a soluble protein, the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Translation from the second start codon produces the core protein (HBcAg).</p><p>The polymerase ORF overlaps with the core, envelope, and X ORFs. The polymerase protein consists of a protein primer, a spacer, a reverse <span class=\"nowrap\">transcriptase/DNA</span> polymerase, and an RNAase H domain.</p><p>The X protein is not required for the replication of the virus. It is a potent transcriptional transactivator of many promoters including HBV and cellular oncogenes. The HBx protein has been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis. Studies also suggest that HBx plays a role in modulating transcriptional activity of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, and may be a target for antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Two major transcripts (3.5 and 2.1 kb) are made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The 3.5 kb RNA has heterogeneous 5'-ends:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The precore mRNA is slightly longer and is initiated upstream of the precore start codon. It is translated into the precore polypeptide, which is then processed at both the N and C terminal ends to a smaller protein, the HBeAg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61295 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pregenomic RNA is initiated within the precore region. It serves as a replicative intermediate and is reverse transcribed into HBV DNA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61295 \">figure 2</a>). In addition, it functions as a messenger RNA for translation into the nucleocapsid and polymerase proteins.</p><p/><p>The 2.1 kb RNA is initiated within the pre-S1 region and is translated into middle and small S proteins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74116 \">figure 1</a>). There are also at least two minor transcripts: the 2.4 kb RNA, which is translated into the large S protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74116 \">figure 1</a>), and a smaller RNA, which is translated into the X protein.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HBV has been classified into 10 genotypes (A to J) based upon an inter-group divergence of 8 percent or more in the complete nucleotide sequence. HBV genotypes have been associated with a risk of HCC development and a response to interferon therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical significance of hepatitis B virus genotypes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Replication cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The replication cycle of HBV begins with attachment of the virion to the hepatocyte membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59125\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59125 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The receptor for HBV (and hepatitis D virus) has been identified as a bile salt transporter, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), which binds to the pre-S1 region of the HBV envelope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The virion is uncoated in the hepatocyte cytoplasm and the viral genome enters the hepatocyte nucleus. </p><p>Inside the hepatocyte nucleus, synthesis of the plus strand HBV DNA is completed and the viral genome is converted into a covalently closed circular DNA (ccc DNA).</p><p>The HBV genome replicates by reverse transcription via an RNA intermediate, the pregenomic RNA. The pregenomic RNA, nucleocapsid, and polymerase proteins are encapsidated in the virus core particle inside which reverse transcription takes place. The pregenomic RNA is the only RNA transcript which is encapsidated. Encapsidation is regulated by the pregenome encapsidation sequence (e) which is located in the precore and proximal core region.</p><p>A new minus strand HBV DNA is produced followed by the synthesis of a new plus strand HBV DNA. Nucleocapsids with the partially double stranded HBV DNA can reenter the hepatocyte nucleus to produce more ccc DNA or be secreted as complete virions after coating with envelope proteins. The ccc DNA appears to have a long half-life and is not inhibited by approved nucleos(t)ide analogue therapies, accounting for the difficulty in achieving virus clearance during treatment of chronic hepatitis B.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of HBV-related liver disease is largely due to immune-mediated mechanisms. In some circumstances, HBV can also cause direct cytotoxic liver injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune-mediated liver injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to immune control of HBV infection, although the T cell response is a double-edge sword playing a role in both immune control as well as liver injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/2,4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-7</a>]. HBV-related liver disease is generally thought to be related to cytotoxic T cell-mediated lysis of infected hepatocytes. However, the noncytolytic T cell immune response is also important. The following observations are consistent with this hypothesis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Events associated with immune clearance, such as spontaneous or interferon-induced HBeAg seroconversion, are often accompanied by exacerbations of liver disease as evidenced by an elevated serum ALT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with chronic hepatitis B who clear HBeAg have more vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to HBV antigens than those who remain HBeAg positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, in HBeAg-positive patients the T cell response to HBV among those in the immune tolerance phase is not necessarily weaker than the T cell response among those in the immune active phase. Thus, the difference between these two phases is in the inflammatory response and not the T cell response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Phases of chronic HBV infection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fulminant hepatitis B is believed to be due to massive immune-mediated lysis of infected hepatocytes. This explains why many patients with fulminant hepatitis B have no evidence of HBV replication at presentation.</p><p/><p>In addition to promoting hepatic injury, both the T cell and antibody responses to HBV help to control the infection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>). In one study, for example, HBV-specific cytotoxic T cells from patients studied up to 23 years after clinical and serologic recovery expressed activation markers indicating recent contact with HBV antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This observation suggests that complete eradication of HBV rarely occurs after recovery from acute hepatitis and that traces of virus can maintain the T cell response for decades following clinical recovery, which in turn keeps the virus under control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>In a study of five patients who were identified during the incubation phase of acute HBV infection, NK cell activation was detected first followed by HBV-specific T cell response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The presence of HBV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ cells during the incubation phase suggests that these cells play an important role in the control of infection and in the initiation of events that lead to liver damage. Maximal reduction in HBV-DNA levels occurred prior to peak increase in serum ALT levels, suggesting that viral control is mediated through noncytolytic as well as cytolytic mechanisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct cytotoxic liver injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HBV is generally not a cytopathic virus. In most patients with chronic hepatitis B, for example, there is no direct correlation between viral load and the severity of liver disease. This is particularly true during the early phase of perinatally acquired HBV infection in which there is high serum HBV DNA but normal serum ALT concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Nevertheless, direct cytopathic liver injury can occur when the viral load is very high as in fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, an unusual form of liver disease seen in some patients with recurrent hepatitis B following liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of viral variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in all regions of HBV have been found in patients with chronic HBV infection. Some of these mutations, such as the precore stop codon mutation, have been incriminated in causing more severe liver disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61295 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. However, these variants have also been found in asymptomatic carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], suggesting that the mutations alone are not necessarily pathogenic. Nevertheless, HBV mutations can potentially modulate the severity of liver disease by altering the level of HBV replication or the expression of immunogenic epitopes. Some variants, for example, do not make HBeAg. Nevertheless, the virus can continue to replicate (as determined by the presence of HBV DNA in serum and elevated serum ALT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>] and, in the case of four surgeons, transmit the infection to others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].
