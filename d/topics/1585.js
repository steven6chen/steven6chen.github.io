Most of the early literature pertaining to AIP came from Japan, where the incidence may be increasing, perhaps due to increased recognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, it has been described in several countries in Europe as well as the United States and Korea, suggesting that it is a worldwide entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>AIP can occur as a primary pancreatic disorder or in association with other disorders of presumed autoimmune etiology, including IgG4 cholangitis, salivary gland disorders, mediastinal fibrosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, tubulointerstitial disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81268 \">table 1</a>). Several publications have indicated that AIP is actually an IgG4 systemic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-igg4-related-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of IgG4-related disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) has been referred to by a variety of names including sclerosing pancreatitis, tumefactive pancreatitis, and nonalcoholic destructive pancreatitis, depending in part upon the specific pathologic findings and the presence of extrapancreatic manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, it is generally believed that the pathologic heterogeneity may reflect different stages or manifestations of the same disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Among patients with AIP, IgG4-positive plasma cells are considered a marker for the disease and can be detected in the pancreas and a variety of other tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. In addition, serum IgG4 levels are elevated to more than two times the upper limit of normal in most patients. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Other manifestations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Serologic testing for IgG4'</a> below.)</p><p>Although earlier reports linked autoimmune pancreatitis to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), it is now recognized that intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tract abnormalities with strictures are most often due to IgG4-associated cholangitis. Nine to 36 percent of patients with findings indicative of PSC have been found to have elevated IgG4 levels compared with 1 percent in other chronic liver diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H61253267\" class=\"local\">'Distinction of IAC from PSC'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of clinical features have been described that may reflect different stages of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81268 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58707\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58707 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/14-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-22</a>].

A pancreatic mass, enlargement, or prominence on imaging was present in 85 percent of patients in an early report of 26 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild abdominal pain with or without attacks of acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis.

Although recurrence is common, AIP is not a frequent cause of idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis, at least in Western countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreatic duct strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/15,22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripancreatic vascular complications are rare, although in the series cited above they were present in 23 percent of patients with AIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Biliary tract manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common presentation of AIP is obstructive jaundice. The term IgG4-associated cholangitis (IAC) has been proposed for the biliary tract manifestations of AIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/15,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p>In a series of 53 patients with IAC, biliary strictures were associated with AIP in 92 percent and confined to the proximal <span class=\"nowrap\">extrahepatic/intrahepatic</span> ducts in 49 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with IAC were more frequently older men who presented with obstructive jaundice (77 percent) and increased serum IgG4 levels (74 percent).</p><p>Another report evaluated 26 patients with AIP in whom <span class=\"nowrap\">extrapancreatic/intrahepatic</span> biliary strictures were present in nine patients (35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis has also been described.</p><p>An obstructive pattern of liver function tests (ie, a disproportionately elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and minimally elevated serum aminotransferases) is commonly seen in patients with biliary tract involvement. These features can also be seen in patients with pancreatic cancer or cholangiocarcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of other organs can be involved in patients with AIP. These include the salivary glands (Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome), bile duct strictures, lung nodules, autoimmune thyroiditis, and kidney (interstitial nephritis with an IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrate and IgG4 deposits in the tubular basement membrane) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81268 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731730186\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinct clinical profiles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmune pancreatitis is now classified into two types. In type 1 AIP, the pancreas is involved as one part of a systemic IgG4-positive disease and meets the HISORt criteria. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-igg4-related-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of IgG4-related disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Type 2 AIP, or idiopathic duct-centric pancreatitis, is characterized by granulocytic lesions, but without IgG4-positive cells and without systemic involvement. In a study of 97 patients with AIP, patients with type 1 AIP were found to have a high relapse rate compared with patients with type 2 AIP who do not experience relapse (49 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In addition, at presentation patients with type 1 AIP were older, had a greater prevalence of IgG4 elevations, and were more likely to have biliary tract disease, retroperitoneal, renal, or salivary gland disease than patients with type 2 AIP. Type 2 AIP is more frequently associated with inflammatory bowel disease than type 1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with the varied symptoms referable to the pancreas and biliary tract described above, particularly in those with other autoimmune conditions. Correct diagnosis can help avert the consequences of progressive disease and unnecessary surgery. An important part of the differential diagnosis is distinguishing AIP from pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/27,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,30</a>].</p><p>A pancreatic biopsy is usually required to establish the diagnosis and is one component of the Mayo Clinic HISORt diagnostic criteria (see below). The presence of immunostaining for IgG4 in plasma cell infiltrates in both the pancreas and extrapancreatic tissues provides support for the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/27,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31-33</a>].</p><p>Diagnostic criteria have been proposed by several groups including the Japanese Pancreas Society, an expert group from Korea, and the Mayo Clinic in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In one series of patients with established AIP, approximately 85 percent of patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of at least one of the groups, suggesting that none of the sets of diagnostic criteria is 100 percent sensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic criteria proposed by the Mayo Clinic (the &quot;HISORt&quot; criteria) are most commonly used in the United States and include the presence of one or more of the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74331\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74331 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/27,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic <strong>H</strong>istology</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristic <strong>I</strong>maging on computed tomography (CT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pancreatography</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated serum IgG4 levels on <strong>S</strong>erologic testing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>O</strong>ther organ involvement (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Other manifestations'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>R</strong>esponse of pancreatic and extrapancreatic manifestations to glucocorticoid <strong>t</strong>herapy (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Biliary strictures'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following histologic findings are highly suggestive or diagnostic of AIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis <strong>or</strong> more than 10 IgG4-positive cells with at least two of the following: periductal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, obliterative phlebitis, and acinar fibrosis (type 1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64636\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64636 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53366%7EGAST%2F74906%7EGAST%2F63135%7EGAST%2F63668%7EGAST%2F55993%7EGAST%2F74906%7EGAST%2F63135%7EGAST%2F71710\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53366 graphicRef74906 graphicRef63135 graphicRef63668 graphicRef55993 graphicRef74906 graphicRef63135 graphicRef71710 \">picture 2A-B, 2B-C, 2C-F</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic duct-centric pancreatitis (IDCP) is characterized by a granulocytic epithelial lesion in the pancreatic duct with minimal IgG4-positive cells in the pancreatic parenchyma (type 2).</p><p/><p>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) may be an option for obtaining histologic specimens from the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In a study of 44 patients with AIP, 19 (43 percent) had findings on histologic examination of samples obtained during EUS-FNA that suggested AIP (14 samples showed lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis, two samples with IgG4-positive plasma cells, and three samples with both) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Despite the low sensitivity (43 percent), EUS-FNA may still have a role since, if positive, it may allow patients to avoid surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AIP is usually first suggested by an imaging test such as contrast-enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87628\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87628 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/25,27,30,37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27,30,37-40</a>]. The main findings that are diagnostic or highly suggestive of AIP are a diffusely enlarged pancreas with featureless borders and delayed enhancement with or without a capsule-like rim [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. By contrast, findings that are highly suggestive or diagnostic of pancreatic cancer include a low density mass, dilatation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cutoff of the pancreatic duct, and distal pancreatic atrophy.</p><p>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may reveal a narrowed main and dorsal pancreatic duct; diffuse, irregular narrowing of the pancreatic duct (beaded appearance), or a focal stricture of the pancreatic duct, proximal or distal common bile duct; or irregular narrowing of the intrahepatic ducts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53448\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53448 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>A stricture in the common bile duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52843\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52843 \">image 2</a>) or the finding of a lesion in the head of the pancreas often prompts consideration of malignancy. Thus, it may not be possible to distinguish AIP from pancreatic cancer based solely upon imaging tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Endoscopic ultrasonography and transabdominal ultrasonography have also been evaluated in patients with AIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Serologic testing for IgG4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic testing for IgG4 is an important component of evaluating a patient suspected of having AIP. IgG4 accounts for only 5 to 6 percent of the total serum IgG in healthy subjects and is typically less than 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. A serum concentration of IgG4 that is &ge;2 times the upper limit of normal is highly suggestive of AIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], but may not rule out pancreatic cancer. This cutoff was chosen because values less than twice the upper limit of normal (serum IgG4 &le;280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> are seen in up to 10 percent of individuals with pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].</p><p>The value of serum IgG4 levels was demonstrated in a study that included 20 patients with AIP (based upon clinical features and response to glucocorticoids), 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, and 154 patients with pancreatic cancer, ordinary chronic pancreatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), or Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median serum IgG4 concentration was much higher in patients with AIP compared with healthy controls (663 versus 51 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>.

At serum IgG4 concentrations of more than 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and more than 280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> the sensitivity for the diagnosis of AIP fell from 76 to 53 percent, while the specificity increased from 93 to 99 percent. Only 1 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer had serum IgG4 levels above 280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> while elevated serum CA 19-9 concentrations were much more common with pancreatic cancer (71 versus 9 percent). Among 268 patients with other pancreatic diseases, only two of the 58 patients with acute pancreatitis had a serum IgG4 above 280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.4 percent of patients with acute pancreatitis and 0.7 percent of all patients with other pancreatic diseases).</p><p>In another study, seven percent of patients with pancreatic cancer had serum IgG4 levels above 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These authors suggested that in patients with pancreatic mass lesions and a suspicion of cancer, an IgG4 level measuring between 135 and 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> should be interpreted cautiously and not accepted as diagnostic of AIP without further evaluation, especially since pancreatic cancer is much more common than AIP.</p><p>The sensitivity values in the Mayo Clinic study demonstrate that many patients with AIP do not have serum IgG4 levels above 280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In addition to pancreatic cancer, serum IgG4 values above normal but &le;280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> have been described in a number of disorders that do not involve the pancreas, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, some parasitic diseases, pemphigus vulgaris, and pemphigus foliaceus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].

Despite these limitations, most patients respond to glucocorticoid therapy, but the relapse rate is significant. Pooling the data from three studies of patients with AIP or IgG4-associated cholangitis (IAC), the response rate to glucocorticoids was 87 percent (67 of 77 patients), with a relapse rate of 62 percent (34 of 55 patients) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83587\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83587 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/15,16,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,26</a>]. However, many patients who relapsed responded to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (23 of 50 patients, 46 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AIP often responds to glucocorticoids, both improving clinical manifestations and potentially preventing complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/30,62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,62-64</a>]. In most reports, one-half to two-thirds of patients responded to glucocorticoids, but approximately 25 percent required a second course of treatment, while a smaller proportion needed continuous treatment.</p><p>The time to response is variable, usually occurring within two weeks to four months. Patients are typically followed with serum IgG4 levels, liver biochemical tests, and occasionally by computed tomography (CT) scan while on therapy. As mentioned above, the response to glucocorticoid therapy is one of the HISORt criteria for the diagnosis of AIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Studies of steroids in AIP have shown the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An illustrative report included 42 patients with AIP, 19 of whom were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The patients were treated with prednisolone (30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for two to four weeks; the dose was tapered by 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> every two to four weeks until reaching 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. The maintenance dose was 2.5 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. The average observation period was 25 months (up to seven years). Imaging studies (ultrasonography, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging) were performed every six months, and biochemical parameters were measured every three to six months. <br/><br/>Unfavorable events (sclerosing cholangitis, distal bile duct stenosis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis) were significantly less common in the patients treated with prednisolone (32 versus 70 percent). This finding supports the recommendation that AIP patients, especially those with obstructive jaundice and bile duct strictures, should be treated and maintained on glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study evaluated the utility of a two-week trial of glucocorticoid therapy in 22 patients who had atypical imaging findings for AIP and did not meet the classic imaging criteria for pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. All patients were treated with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day). At two weeks, glucocorticoid responsiveness was defined as a marked improvement in narrowing of the main pancreatic duct and a reduction in the pancreatic mass. All 15 patients who responded were diagnosed as having AIP, while the presence of pancreatic cancer was confirmed in all seven patients who did not respond.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third report described 44 patients with either type 1 AIP (64 percent of the patients) or type 2 AIP (36 percent of the patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Steroids were effective in all treated patients but relapse occurred in 12 patients (27 percent) after a median delay of six months (range 1 to 70 months). High serum IgG4 levels at the time of diagnosis and other organ involvement were associated with relapse. Exocrine and endocrine insufficiencies were present in 34 and 39 percent of the patients, respectively. Steroids, with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> treatment, did not prevent pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Type 2 AIP was more frequently associated with inflammatory bowel disease than type 1 AIP (31 and 3 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>Radiologic features that predict a response to glucocorticoids have been identified, but their predictive accuracy remains uncertain. In one report, for example, CT findings of diffuse swelling and a halo (a hypoattenuating rim surrounding the pancreas) were predictive of a favorable response to glucocorticoids, while predictors of a suboptimal response were ductal strictures (2 of 13 suboptimal) and a focal mass-like swelling that persisted after resolution of diffuse changes (7 of 13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. It was proposed that the predictors of a favorable response represented an early inflammatory phase, while predictors of a suboptimal response represented a late stage with a predominance of fibrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Biliary strictures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The response to glucocorticoids in patients who have biliary strictures is more variable than the response in patients with pancreatitis. In some reports, strictures responded to glucocorticoids, while in others they did not respond, had an incomplete response, or required maintenance therapy with glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunomodulatory drugs to prevent relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/15,26,34,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26,34,67,68</a>].</p><p>An illustrative series included 53 patients with IgG4-associated cholangitis (IAC), 30 of whom were treated initially with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for four weeks followed by a taper of 5 mg per week for a total of 11 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary strictures were confined to the intrahepatic duct in 51 percent of IAC patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proximal <span class=\"nowrap\">extrahepatic/intrahepatic</span> ducts were involved in 49 percent of IAC patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An initial response to glucocorticoids was seen in 29 patients (97 percent), but only 18 (60 percent) had resolution of strictures and normalization of liver biochemical tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapse was seen in 71 percent of patients with a proximal stricture, less than six months after the glucocorticoid was tapered; the presence of intrahepatic or proximal extrahepatic strictures was predictive of relapse in these patients. Among 15 patients retreated with glucocorticoids, 8 (44 percent) relapsed when they were tapered. Seven patients who had at least one relapse were treated with immunomodulatory drugs. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Immunomodulatory drugs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>A prospective study evaluated 28 patients with AIP, 23 of whom had coexisting IAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. All patients responded within six weeks to glucocorticoid therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> which was tapered by 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> every two weeks). Prednisolone was discontinued, if possible, after three to four months. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remission was attained in 23 patients at a median of five months (range 1.5 to 17 months).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five patients could not be weaned because of disease flare, and eight patients who attained remission relapsed.

It remains unclear how long treatment with glucocorticoids should be continued in patients who require therapy for maintenance of remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Immunomodulatory drugs have been used in patients who fail steroids, relapse, or cannot be weaned off steroids. Successful treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, a monoclonal antibody, has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>]. However, further studies are required before rituximab can be routinely recommended.</p><p>The following observations were noted in the two studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study included 116 patients with type 1 AIP who were initially treated with steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. During a median follow-up of 47 months, 52 patients experienced 76 relapse episodes. The first relapse was treated with another course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in 24 patients and with prednisone and an immunomodulator in 27 patients. Failure or intolerance of immunomodulator therapy occurred in 17 patients (45 percent). Of the patients with steroid or immunomodulator <span class=\"nowrap\">intolerance/resistance</span> who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, 10 of 12 (83 percent) experienced complete remission and had no relapse. Of note, the relapse-free survival was similar in patients treated with steroids plus immunomodulator and those treated with steroids alone. Rituximab was effective in the treatment of both immunomodulator-resistant and steroid-intolerant patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter international study of 1064 patients with AIP (978 with type 1 and 86 with type 2 AIP) evaluated long-term outcomes of AIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-pancreatitis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Patients were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> with tapering of 5 to 10 mg every one to two weeks. Asian centers used maintenance low-dose prednisone 2.5 to 5.0 mg per day continuing for six months to three years. North American studies did not use maintenance steroid therapy, but rather used immunomodulator drugs (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for one to three years). Successful remission was induced in 681 of 684 type 1 AIP patients (99.6 percent) and 48 of 52 patients with type 2 AIP (92 percent). However, disease relapse occurred in 245 of 684 type 1 patients (36 percent) but only 8 of 52 patients (15 percent) with type 2 AIP. In the management of relapse, steroids were successful in 201 of 210 patients (95 percent) and azathioprine was successful in 56 of 68 patients (85 percent). A small number of patients responded to 6-mercaptopurine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. There was no significant difference in relapse rates based on the presence of diffuse or focal pancreatic disease and between patients with persistently elevated IgG4 levels following treatment with steroids or those with a normal level.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is an infrequently recognized disorder of presumed autoimmune etiology that is associated with characteristic clinical, histologic, and morphologic findings. It has been described as a primary pancreatic disorder and also in association with other diseases of presumed autoimmune etiology. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several clinical features have been described, possibly reflecting different stages of the disease or varying extrapancreatic manifestations. These include mild, acute recurrent pancreatitis, biliary and pancreatic duct strictures with a clinical presentation resembling primary sclerosing cholangitis, and a pancreatic mass that can be confused with pancreatic carcinoma or lymphoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81268 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AIP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with varied pancreatic and hepatobiliary manifestations. A pancreatic biopsy is required to establish the diagnosis, although it is also supported by elevated serum levels of IgG4, characteristic radiologic findings, and response to corticosteroids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87628\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87628 \">image 1</a>). The diagnostic criteria proposed by the Mayo Clinic (the &quot;HISORt&quot; criteria) are most commonly used in the United States to establish the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74331\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74331 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that patients with AIP be treated with glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Our approach is to initiate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dosage of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for four to six weeks followed by a taper of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span>. Toward the end of the four- to six-week induction period, we perform repeat imaging tests (typically computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, whichever was obtained initially) to evaluate for radiologic improvement (eg, a decrease in focal mass, diffuse swelling, narrowed pancreatic duct or biliary strictures). Most patients destined to respond demonstrate clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiologic improvement within the first four to six weeks. Failure to respond in this timeframe should raise the possibility of alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who relapse upon a reduction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> discontinuation of glucocorticoids can be managed with a repeat course <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maintenance therapy aiming for the minimum glucocorticoid dose that provides a maintained response (typically in range of 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> daily). An incomplete response <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> relapse is more likely in patients who have biliary strictures. In patients with coexisting immunoglobulin G4-associated cholangitis, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. We also consider immunomodulators in AIP patients without IgG4 cholangitis who fail steroid therapy.
