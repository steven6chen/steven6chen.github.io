Although CHD mortality rates worldwide have declined over the past four decades, CHD remains responsible for about one-third or more of all deaths in individuals over age 35 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. It has been estimated that nearly one-half of all middle-aged men and one-third of middle-aged women in the United States will develop some manifestation of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Population<strong>-</strong>based epidemiologic data, such as that from the Framingham Heart Study, provide the best assessment of the risk factors that contribute to the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) and to the way it evolves, progresses, and terminates because these data are less encumbered by the unavoidable selection bias of clinical trials data. In addition, epidemiologic data provide critical information regarding targets for the primary and secondary prevention of CHD.</p><p>This topic will discuss the incidence, prevalence, trend in mortality, and general prognosis of CHD. The discussion of outcomes after myocardial infarction is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-after-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis after myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incidence, prevalence, and prognosis of non-coronary cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as cerebrovascular or peripheral artery disease are discussed elsewhere.

It is sometimes used synonymously with CHD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary heart disease (CHD) includes the diagnoses of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, silent myocardial ischemia, and CHD mortality that result from coronary artery disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the pathologic process (usually atherosclerosis) affecting the entire arterial circulation, not just the coronary arteries. Stroke, transient ischemic attacks, angina, myocardial infarction, claudication, and critical limb ischemia are manifestations of CVD.

Participants in these studies are not necessarily under the care of clinicians and generalizing these findings to the present day should be undertaken with caution. For example, the observations in a report may be a compilation of data that summarizes the experience of many years, the diagnosis may be self-report or field survey methods, and it may be difficult to compare results across studies because of differences in methods. In addition, interpretation of the efficacy of treatments in observational studies can be difficult: behavioral interventions and medications may be identified, but it can be difficult to be sure that the individual actually complied with what was prescribed or recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2017 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics update of the American Heart Association reported that 16.5 million persons &ge;20 years of age in the United States have coronary heart disease (CHD), with a slight male predominance (55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The reported prevalence increases with age for both women and men. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 estimated that 17.3 million deaths worldwide in 2013 were related to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), a 41 percent increase since 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although the absolute numbers of CVD deaths had significantly increased since 1990, the age-standardized death rate decreased by 22 percent in the same period, primarily due to shifting age demographics and causes of death worldwide.</p><p>In a 2009 report that used NHANES data, MI prevalence was compared by sex in middle-aged individuals (35 to 54 years) during the 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2004 time periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although MI prevalence was significantly greater in men than women in both time periods (2.5 versus 0.7 and 2.2 versus 1.0 respectively), there were trends toward a decrease in men and an increase in women.</p><p>Data from NHANES (and other databases) that rely on self-reported MI and angina from health interviews probably underestimate the actual prevalence of advanced CHD. This is likely as advanced occlusive coronary artery disease often exists with few symptoms or overt clinical manifestations. Silent ischemia, which is thought to account for 75 percent of all ischemic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], may be brought to light by electrocardiographic changes (ST segment depression) on an exercise test, ambulatory 24-hour electrocardiographic recording, or periodic routine electrocardiogram (ECG). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Silent myocardial ischemia and infarction'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silent-myocardial-ischemia-epidemiology-diagnosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Silent myocardial ischemia: Epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Autopsy data have documented a reduced prevalence of anatomic CHD over time in both the general population and military personnel.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 2562 autopsies performed between 1979 and 1994, the prevalence of significant anatomic CHD in subjects aged 20 to 59 years fell from 42 to 32 percent in men and 29 to 16 percent in women when the periods 1979 to 1983 and 1990 to 1994 were compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

This represents a marked decline in the prevalence of autopsy-documented CHD compared with the rates seen during the Korean War in the 1950s (77 percent) and the Vietnam War in the 1960s (45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Demographics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from 44 years of follow-up in the original Framingham Study cohort and 20 years of surveillance of their offspring has allowed ascertainment of the incidence of initial coronary events including both recognized and clinically unrecognized MI, angina pectoris, unstable angina, and sudden and non-sudden coronary deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. The following observations were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For persons aged 40 years, the lifetime risk of developing CHD is 49 percent in men and 32 percent in women. For those reaching age 70 years, the lifetime risk is 35 percent in men and 24 percent in women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For total coronary events, the incidence rises steeply with age, with women lagging behind men by 10 years. For the more serious manifestations of coronary disease, such as MI and sudden death, women lag behind men in incidence by 20 years, but the sex ratio for incidence narrows progressively with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The incidence at ages 65 to 94 compared to ages 35 to 64 more than doubles in men and triples in women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In premenopausal women, serious manifestations of coronary disease, such as MI and sudden death, are relatively rare.

Beyond 65 years of age, coronary disease still predominates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56067 \">table 1</a>). Coronary events comprise 33 to 65 percent of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in men and 28 to 58 percent in women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82374\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82374 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The male predominance of CHD is least striking for angina pectoris. Under 75 years of age, the initial presentation of coronary disease in women is more likely to be angina pectoris than MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Furthermore, angina in women is more likely to be uncomplicated (80 percent), while angina in men often occurs after a MI (66 percent). Infarction predominates at virtually all ages in men in whom only 20 percent of infarctions are preceded by long-standing angina; the percentage is even lower if the MI is silent or unrecognized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82589\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82589 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition to <span class=\"nowrap\">sex/gender,</span> other factors may influence whether the initial presentation of CHD is an acute MI or stable angina. A case control study of adults with a first clinical presentation of coronary disease as either acute MI (n = 916) or stable exertional angina (n = 468) suggested that recent prior therapy with statins and beta blockers affects the clinical presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The incidence of CHD decreased from 133 to 114 cases per 10,000 persons per year of follow-up.

During the interval from 1988 to 1998, there was a declining trend in the age-adjusted incidence of any new coronary disease (MI, sudden death, unstable angina, or angiographically diagnosed CHD) from 57 to 50 cases per 10,000 persons (relative risk 0.91, 95% CI 0.82-1.01).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">International trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart disease mortality has been declining in the United States and in regions where economies and health care systems are relatively advanced, but the experience is often quite different around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Ischemic heart disease is the number one cause of death in adults from both low- and middle income countries as well as from high-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. At the turn of the century, it was reported that coronary heart disease mortality was expected to increase approximately 29 percent in women and 48 percent in men in developed countries between 1990 and 2020.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart disease mortality has been declining in the United States and in regions where economies and health care systems are relatively advanced, but the experience is often quite different around the world.
