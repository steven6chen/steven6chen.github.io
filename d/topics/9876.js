Li-Fraumeni syndrome is also known as the Sarcoma, Breast, Leukemia, and Adrenal Gland (SBLA) cancer syndrome. This cancer predisposition syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder and is associated with abnormalities in the tumor protein p53 gene (<em>TP53</em>).</p><p>The molecular pathogenesis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management, and implications for genetic counseling of patients and their families are reviewed here. The treatment of specific malignancies that develop in these patients is discussed separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H639664557\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only gene that has been definitively associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome is the tumor protein p53 gene (<em>TP53</em>), which is located on chromosome 17p13.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Although mutations at two other locations (one at 1q23 and the checkpoint kinase 2 gene [<em>CHEK2</em>] locus at 22q12.1) have been postulated, there has been no validation of the 1q23 linkage, and <em>CHEK2</em> has been discounted as a Li-Fraumeni gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. <em>TP53</em> is a tumor suppressor gene that has a major role in determining the fate of cells that contain damaged DNA. The gene product, tumor protein p53, can delay cell cycle progression, permitting an opportunity for DNA repair or initiation of programmed cell death (apoptosis). In the absence of the normal activated p53 protein, cells containing damaged DNA can survive and proliferate, which contributes to malignant transformation.</p><p>A variety of molecular techniques have been used to detect mutations in <em>TP53</em>, including sequence analysis of all or part of the gene, and techniques for detecting gene deletion or duplication. Over 300 distinct germline mutations of <em>TP53</em> have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Missense mutations comprise the majority of these; most occur in exons 5 to 8, which are the DNA-binding region of the gene.</p><p>Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease in which affected individuals have inherited one abnormal copy of <em>TP53</em>. In tumors from these patients, the second allele of <em>TP53</em> is either somatically mutated or deleted, leaving cells with no functional gene product.</p><p>Not all patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome diagnosed based upon clinical criteria have a detectable mutation or abnormality in <em>TP53</em>. The absence of a detectable mutation may be due to novel mutations that have not previously been described or to an abnormality of the gene promoter that leads to defective protein expression. Alternatively, such individuals may not have a germline abnormality in <em>TP53</em>, and may have a mutation in an as-yet-unidentified gene or may represent cases where the malignancy has occurred by chance. (See <a href=\"#H639664593\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H639664564\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H639664664\"><span class=\"h2\">Spectrum of malignancies and age at onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Li-Fraumeni syndrome was originally described in 1969 based upon the identification of second soft tissue sarcomas in five families with index cases of rhabdomyosarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These observations were subsequently extended to 24 kindreds, in which 151 individuals developed cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These patients were characterized by a variety of bone and soft tissue sarcomas and breast cancer, approximately 80 percent of which occurred prior to 45 years of age. Other tumors that occurred disproportionately in this series included brain tumors, leukemia, and adrenocortical carcinoma, and there were six patients with cancer that was linked to antecedent radiation therapy. Other reports have confirmed the high frequency of early age at onset in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, as well as the wide range of cancers that are seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/1-3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,8,9</a>].</p><p>The spectrum of malignancy and its relationship to age are illustrated by a multicenter study of 1730 patients who were referred for mutation testing based upon clinical criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In this cohort, 415 mutation carriers were identified, and 322 (78 percent) of the carriers had developed malignancy. Multiple primary tumors were observed in 43 percent of mutation carriers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 132 children who had developed a malignancy, the most common tumors were osteosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, central nervous system tumors (mainly glial tumors, choroid plexus carcinoma, and medulloblastoma), and soft tissue sarcoma (30, 27, 26, and 23 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 219 adults with malignancy, the most common were breast cancer (all in women) and soft tissue sarcoma (79 and 27 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>A wide variety of other malignancies have been reported in smaller numbers of patients in other series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/1,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9-11</a>]. These have included melanoma, gastric cancer, lymphoma, Wilms tumor, lung adenocarcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma. As with the more common malignancies associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, these have also occurred at a much earlier age than that at which they commonly occur in patients without a tumor protein p53 gene (<em>TP53</em>) mutation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525774358\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an abnormality in <em>TP53</em> who develop cancer are at a markedly increased risk of developing a second malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. This was illustrated by a series of 200 Li-Fraumeni syndrome individuals from 24 kindreds who had been diagnosed with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this group, 30 (15 percent) developed a second malignancy, and smaller numbers developed a third or fourth cancer. The cumulative probability of developing a second malignancy 30 years after the diagnosis of the initial cancer was 57 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525774378\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation-associated cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several case reports have suggested that radiation-induced cancers are more common in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], and preclinical studies have provided additional evidence in support of this relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, radiation therapy is generally avoided as a component in the management of these patients whenever possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-associated-sarcomas#H785738118\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-associated sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Genetic predisposition'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H639664572\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifetime risk of cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a high penetrance of mutated <em>TP53</em>. For women, the lifetime risk of cancer approaches 100 percent and has been estimated to be approximately 90 percent by age 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. This risk may be lower in men compared with women, with an estimated lifetime risk of developing cancer of 73 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These risks, nonetheless, reflect mutations predominantly in the core binding domain of <em>TP53</em>, whereas mutations outside this region may have somewhat lower risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H639664579\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC MALIGNANCIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once cancers develop, their behavior is generally similar to that in patients without Li-Fraumeni syndrome, other than the earlier age of onset. However, the susceptibility to second and subsequent primary tumors and the implications for other family members are important factors in patient management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H639664672\"><span class=\"h2\">Sarcomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all types of soft tissue and bone sarcomas are seen in families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, with the exception of Ewing sarcoma. Although these tumors can occur in adults with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, the median age at onset is approximately 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In an analysis of 531 families or individuals with germline tumor protein p53 gene (<em>TP53</em>) mutations, sarcomas accounted for approximately 25 percent of tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At all ages, osteosarcomas were more common in those with germline mutations compared with those developing sporadic sarcomas; rhabdomyosarcomas were particularly common in those less than five years of age.

In one series, the median age at diagnosis of breast cancer was 33 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]; in another report, approximately one-third occurred prior to age 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a population-based series of breast cancer in those &lt;31 years of age, 6 of 115 patients (5 percent) had <em>TP53</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Breast cancer in men has not been a part of Li-Fraumeni syndrome.</p><p>For women with breast cancer, mastectomy, rather than lumpectomy, plus radiation therapy is generally recommended because of the risks of a second breast primary or a radiation-induced second cancer.

In a series of 12 cancers in nine young women, 10 were positive for HER2 (83 percent), whereas only 16 percent of a control group of 231 breast cancers in young women without the <em>TP53</em> mutation were positive for HER2.

Of particular note, a high percentage of choroid plexus carcinomas are associated with germline mutations in <em>TP53</em>, even in the absence of another cancer or a positive family history.

However, there is now evidence that knowledge of <em>TP53</em> mutation status could alter the natural history of Li-Fraumeni-syndrome-associated cancers, and testing in early infancy can now be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/li-fraumeni-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

In baseline surveillance imaging, a total of 42 new cancers were diagnosed in 39 individuals (6.7 percent of the study population). Of these, 35 were localized and treated with curative intent. False-positive findings on whole-body MRI that required further evaluation (additional imaging or biopsy) were found in 173 people (29.9 percent of the cohort). The value of baseline whole-body MRI needs to be balanced against the high frequency of false-positive results.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome is manifested by a tendency to develop various malignancies at an unusual age, including breast cancer, sarcomas, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinomas. (See <a href=\"#H639664557\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive diagnosis is based upon the identification of a germline <em>TP53</em> mutation. The classical, Birch, and Chompret criteria have been proposed to identify individuals who are candidates for molecular screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79296\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79296 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58516 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H639664593\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals known to harbor a <em>TP53</em> germline mutation, surveillance should include careful attention to overall health. Screening for breast cancer with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in women and for colon cancer should begin at an early age. The use of annual whole-body MRI should also be considered. (See <a href=\"#H639664642\" class=\"local\">'Cancer surveillance strategy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of malignancies that are diagnosed in Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients generally is the same as for other individuals. However, in women with breast cancer, mastectomy, rather than lumpectomy, plus radiation therapy is generally indicated because of the risk of second malignancies due to radiation-induced tumors.
