It is caused by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, resulting in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in lysosomes in multiple cell types throughout the body. </p><p>While males are more severely diseased, most heterozygous females are also affected, though usually at a later age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. </p><p>Clinical manifestations are variable and include cutaneous, corneal, cardiac, renal, and neurologic manifestations. The typical presentation occurs in children who suffer from peripheral neuropathy of the hands and feet, nausea, and abdominal pain. However, diagnosis is frequently missed due to the rarity of the disease. Other characteristic features include reduced sweating and the cutaneous lesions of angiokeratoma corporis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F81624\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81624 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71039\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71039 \">picture 2</a>), which are vascular papules typically distributed in the inguinal, hip, and periumbilical areas. These become more prominent with age. Manifestations of renal disease include proteinuria and progressive renal insufficiency, which sometimes result in end-stage renal disease. In adults, there is progressive cardiac, renal, and cerebral involvement (transient ischemic attacks and strokes), which are the major causes of death associated with Fabry disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cardiac features of Fabry disease and the incidence of unexpected Fabry disease in patients with otherwise unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy will be reviewed here. The general clinical manifestations and treatment of Fabry disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23202342\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H426803274\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular manifestations of Fabry disease include left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), aortic and mitral regurgitation, conduction defects, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and aortic root dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. The right ventricle is also often hypertrophied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Many patients with cardiac involvement are asymptomatic, whereas others present with angina, dyspnea, palpitations, or syncope. Rare patients have advanced heart failure symptoms in the setting of unexplained LVH and generally normal LV ejection fraction (LVEF). </p><p>Although LVH has been detected in some children, cardiovascular signs and symptoms are not usually evident until the third or fourth decade or later in men and approximately a decade later in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]. While males are more severely diseased, most heterozygous females are also affected, though usually at a later age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Life expectancy is reduced by approximately 20 years in untreated males and by approximately 15 years in females compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. It has been hypothesized that women are affected due to inactivation of the normal X-chromosome, though the frequency of disease in women is greater than expected due to X-inactivation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Cardiac manifestations typically accompany other findings of Fabry disease, but they can occasionally occur as the sole manifestation of the disease in patients with the &quot;cardiac variant.&quot; As an example, in a series of 139 patients with Fabry disease, while 60 percent have cardiovascular signs and symptoms, only two patients had cardiovascular manifestations without any other signs of Fabry disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among patients with Fabry disease, women are more likely to present with the cardiac variant of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23202538\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventricular hypertrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unexplained LVH is the hallmark of cardiac disease and is more common and more severe in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/7,8,15,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,15,17-19</a>]. Several patterns of LVH and remodeling occur, including concentric, asymmetric, and eccentric hypertrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F87847\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87847 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Early concentric remodeling progresses to concentric hypertrophy, which is the most common pattern seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20</a>]. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy occurs in approximately 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In some cases of severe cardiac disease, the septum may appear asymmetrically hypertrophied because the basal posterior wall is thinned due to fibrosis. Dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction is rare (occurring in &lt;1 percent) but has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>LVH is likely due to both myocyte hypertrophy and glycolipid deposition. The extent of hypertrophy increases with age and is inversely correlated with renal function and alpha-galactosidase A activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>LVH is generally diagnosed by echocardiography and is frequently suggested by electrocardiography. Echocardiography also enables detection of alterations in systolic and diastolic myocardial function that may accompany LVH. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is also helpful in identifying LVH and other features of Fabry heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H426803267\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac tests'</a> below.) </p><p>Right ventricular hypertrophy and impaired right ventricular function (as assessed by strain rate imaging) are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients with late gadolinium enhancement of the left ventricle had the most impaired right ventricular function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265155231\"><span class=\"h3\">Myocardial fibrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interstitial and replacement myocardial fibrosis (particularly around severely narrowed intraluminal coronary arteries) has been observed on endomyocardial biopsy in patients with cardiac Fabry disease with angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The distribution of myocardial fibrosis can be identified by late gadolinium enhancement on CMR imaging.

Atrial arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, are more common and appear related to age. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia may be related to LV wall thickness. Conduction abnormalities may be caused glycolipid deposition in the atrioventricular (AV) node, His bundle, and bundle branches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The PR interval may be short due to accelerated atrioventricular conduction, particularly in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Older patients may develop PR prolongation (first degree AV block) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28</a>] and bundle branch abnormalities and may progress to advanced AV block, though progression to requiring a pacemaker is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/24,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497694753\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortic dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fabry disease may also cause aortic dilation, particularly in men. In a study of 52 men and 54 women (mean age 42 years) with Fabry disease, aortic dilation at the sinus of Valsalva was identified in 33 percent of men and 6 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Ascending aortic aneurysms (&gt;1.5 x 21 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/m<sup>2</span> </sup>x body surface area) were present in 10 percent of men and 2 percent of women. In women, the diameter of the sinus of Valsalva correlated with systolic blood pressure, but in men, there was no correlation between aortic diameter and systolic or diastolic blood pressure. (See <a href=\"#H426803254\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiogram'</a> below and <a href=\"#H426803774\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac magnetic resonance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2831906\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension is common in patients with Fabry disease with over one-half developing increased blood pressure after the onset of chronic kidney disease.

Among 2869 Fabry Registry patients (1424 men and 1445 women) not treated with enzyme replacement therapy, 5.8 percent of men and 3.7 percent of women experienced cardiovascular events at mean ages of 45 and 54 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Heart failure was the most common first cardiovascular event. Hypertension and LVH were risk factors for cardiovascular events. Possible causes of sudden death in Fabry disease include ventricular arrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Concentric LVH is the most frequent pattern of LV remodeling seen with this disease. The LVEF is usually normal. In contrast, speckle tracking and tissue Doppler measures of systolic and diastolic function are frequently abnormal in patients with Fabry disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Patients with Fabry disease without LVH had reduced longitudinal SR but normal radial SR while patients with LVH had reduced longitudinal and radial SR. Patients with LVH who had late gadolinium enhancement on CMR imaging had severely reduced radial and longitudinal function.</p><p>An echocardiographic binary appearance of the myocardium (a thickened hyperechogenic endocardial layer subtended by a hypoechogenic layer) was proposed as a marker of Fabry disease reflecting endomyocardial glycosphingolipids compartmentalization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55283\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55283 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].
