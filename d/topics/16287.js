They are considered to be intraaxial in location and can be either primary or metastatic. Primary spinal cord tumors account for 2 to 4 percent of all primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors, one-third of which are located in the intramedullary compartment.</p><p>Spinal cord tumors can be classified according to their anatomic location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71964\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71964 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intramedullary &ndash; Intramedullary tumors arise within the spinal cord itself. Most primary intramedullary tumors are either ependymomas or astrocytomas. Metastases are being recognized with increasing frequency, primarily because of improvements in imaging modalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intradural-extramedullary &ndash; Tumors arising within the dura but outside the actual spinal cord are termed intradural-extramedullary. The most common tumors in this group are meningiomas and nerve sheath tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meningioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, and diagnosis of meningioma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradural-nerve-sheath-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradural nerve sheath tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extradural &ndash; Extradural tumors are usually metastatic and most often arise in the vertebral bodies. Metastatic lesions can cause spinal cord compression either by epidural growth that results in extrinsic spinal cord or cauda equina compression or less frequently by intradural invasion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The relative frequency of primary spinal tumors is illustrated by a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and National Program of Cancer Registries analysis that included 11,712 cases identified over a four year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Of these, 9136 were benign (78 percent) and 2576 were malignant (22 percent). By histology, the three most common tumors were meningioma, tumors of spinal nerves, and ependymoma (33, 27, and 21 percent, respectively).</p><p>The clinical manifestations and general approach to spinal cord tumors will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumors within or extrinsic to the spinal cord can cause symptoms through disruption of normal neural elements and pathways, producing both local and distal effects.</p><p>The most frequent local effect is pain that causes nocturnal awakening. Patients often describe this pain as a gnawing and unremitting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The site of this may provide an indication of the anatomic location of the tumor.</p><p>Neurologic dysfunction distal to the lesion is due to interruption of ascending and descending spinal cord pathways. The most common sequelae are sensory dysesthesias and muscular weakness, especially of the iliopsoas musculature. Patients often report progressive difficulty in ambulation. Severe distal sensory loss and sphincter dysfunction also may occur. Although neurologic manifestations may begin unilaterally, they can progress to involve both sides of the spinal cord and thereby produce bilateral symptoms and signs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prior history of cancer may suggest a diagnosis of metastasis to the spinal column, which may cause axial or radiating pain. Referred pain, eg, to the shoulder or neck, is also common with spinal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The spine is a common metastatic site for many tumor types. As an example, vertebral metastases have been found at autopsy in 90 percent of patients who died of prostate cancer, 74 percent with breast cancer, and 45 percent with lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough physical examination is necessary to define probable sites of tumor involvement, document preoperative neurologic deficits, and determine progressive neurologic deterioration. An assessment of the patient's ambulatory status is also necessary since this carries important prognostic significance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is currently the diagnostic study of choice, providing excellent delineation of the spinal cord and surrounding structures. Almost all intrinsic spinal cord tumors and metastases enhance with gadolinium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;, section on 'Radiologic confirmation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAMEDULLARY TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of intramedullary primary spinal cord tumors are gliomas. The term glioma refers to a tumor bearing a histologic resemblance link to normal glial cells. The major types of glial tumors are ependymomas, astrocytomas, and oligodendrogliomas, and mixtures of these cell types are occasionally seen within a single tumor. Spinal cord gliomas are rare compared to cerebral lesions, probably because of the relative paucity of glial tissue in the spinal cord.</p><p>The distribution of histologic subtypes of spinal gliomas also differs considerably from intracranial gliomas. Although glioblastomas account for the majority of intracranial gliomas, they comprise only 5 percent of spinal lesions. In contrast, ependymomas comprise approximately 60 to 80 percent of spinal gliomas compared to 3 percent of intracranial gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Ependymomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ependymomas are intramedullary tumors that may be located anywhere along the spinal cord. Approximately one-half occur in the lumbosacral spinal cord or filum terminale; the other 50 percent occur anywhere in the cervical or thoracic spinal cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80987\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80987 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Extraneural metastases are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ependymoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ependymoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumors, ependymal tumors are divided into five major groups: subependymoma, myxopapillary ependymoma, RELA-fusion positive ependymoma, and anaplastic ependymoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Ependymoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ependymomas are the most common intramedullary spinal cord tumors in adults, with a peak age at presentation between 30 and 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The cellular subtype is most common.</p><p>Patients often have localized pain for months to years prior to developing other symptoms. Neurologic deficits may include lower extremity spasticity, loss of pain and temperature sensation, lower extremity and truncal sensory diminution to light touch and vibration, and gait ataxia. Ependymomas tend occur centrally within the cord, expanding it symmetrically as they grow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The spinal cord may be expanded along several segments, and a tumor-associated cyst (syrinx) is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These lesions generally enhance intensely on MRI.</p><p>Optimal management consists of gross total resection by an experienced surgeon. Although these are infiltrative tumors, a total or near-total resection can frequently be achieved without causing further neurologic deficits. There are no randomized trials that have evaluated the role of adjuvant RT.</p><p>The most extensive data on the natural history and response to treatment come from an observational series of 126 patients with spinal ependymoma, treated over a 47-year period at six institutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The most frequent subtype was cellular ependymoma, which accounted for approximately 60 percent of classified cases; approximately 70 percent were moderate grade. Myxopapillary ependymomas comprised 17 cases in this series (13 percent).</p><p>Treatment included complete resection in 63 cases (50 percent); in 12 of these (19 percent), postoperative RT was given [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among patients in whom a partial resection or biopsy only was performed, 47 of 58 (81 percent) had RT as part of their initial management. Median follow-up was approximately four years. Progression-free and overall survival rates at 15 years were 35 and 75 percent, respectively. Multivariate analyses supported the importance of complete resection, but did not demonstrate a benefit from adjuvant RT. Other large retrospective studies have reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>There is no proven role for chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic spinal cord ependymomas. However, the authors have occasionally seen disease stabilization in patients with advanced disease treated with carboplatin-based regimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Myxopapillary ependymoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myxopapillary ependymomas are biologically and morphologically distinct from other ependymomas. These tumors most commonly arise in the lumbosacral spinal cord and filum terminale. Immunohistochemistry may be needed to differentiate myxopapillary ependymomas from either chordomas or chondrosarcomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chordoma-and-chondrosarcoma-of-the-skull-base\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Myxopapillary ependymomas are slow-growing glial tumors that typically are found in young adults and are more common in males, with a reported male to female ratio ranging from 1.4 to 2.5 to 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. The median age at diagnosis is 35 to 37 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. Myxopapillary ependymomas generally present with low back pain, with or without radicular features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The vast majority of these tumors are located in the lumbosacral or thoracolumbar spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. Due to the propensity for seeding of the neuraxis, complete brain and spine MR imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be performed at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Initial management of these tumors consists of laminectomy with attempted surgical resection. These tumors frequently can be totally resected, and many patients are cured following gross total resection. However, some patients recur locally or with leptomeningeal tumor dissemination as much as 20 years after the initial surgery. </p><p>Subtotal resection may be necessary, particularly in patients with unencapsulated tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/15,16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,19</a>]. Consensus-based guidelines published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggest postoperative RT in patients who have undergone subtotal resection or biopsy of a myxopapillary ependymoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Most observational studies have found that postoperative RT is associated with improved local control and progression-frees survival, but the effect on overall survival is less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/15-17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17,19</a>]. There are no randomized trials addressing the role of postoperative radiation therapy (RT). There is a suggestion that higher doses of RT (50.4 to 54 Gy) are more effective than lower doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In large series, the estimated 10-year overall survival exceeds 90 percent, but up to one-third of patients recur at a median of approximately two years from diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. The most common pattern of treatment failure is local (85 percent), followed by distant spinal and brain alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Risk factors for decreased local control and disease-free survival include young age (&lt;36 years) and subtotal resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Molecular determinants of outcome have not been established.</p><p>Long-term morbidity and late complications of therapy have not been well studied in patients with myxopapillary ependymoma. In the largest series to date, late adverse events were reported in approximately one quarter of patients and included chronic pain, motor paraplegia, hypoesthesia, and urinary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bowel sphincter dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Anaplastic ependymoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These high-grade ependymomas have anaplastic features on histological examination (necrosis, mitosis, vascular proliferation, cellular pleomorphism, and overlapping of nuclei) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These tumors are relatively uncommon and comprised only 5 percent of spinal ependymomas in one large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Compared to lower grade ependymomas, anaplastic tumors appear to have a higher recurrence rate and poorer survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Astrocytomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Astrocytomas occur throughout the spinal cord. The pathologic features of spinal astrocytic lesions are predictive of the biologic behavior and clinical course. Approximately one-half of spinal cord astrocytomas are pilocytic and one-half are infiltrative astrocytomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pilocytic astrocytomas are well circumscribed and low grade with nonaggressive clinical behavior. On MRI these tumors enhance intensely with gadolinium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78717\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78717 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas of the spinal cord usually appear as nonencapsulated lesions that enhance minimally or heterogeneously on MRI. About one-third are histologically high-grade (anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma [GBM]). Approximately half of these tumors harbor H3K27M mutations in histone coding genes and are now classified as H3K27M-mutant midline gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p>There are no randomized trials defining the optimal approach to the management of these tumors. The most extensive experience comes from a retrospective series of 136 patients (69 with pilocytic lesions and 67 with infiltrative astrocytomas) treated at the Mayo Clinic over a 43 year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At diagnosis, the median age was 35 years, and symptoms were present for a median of eight months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gross total resection was feasible in 16 percent of patients, subtotal resection in 25 percent, and biopsy only in 59 percent. There were no differences between pilocytic and infiltrative lesions in the extent of resection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival was significantly longer for patients with pilocytic tumors compared to those with infiltrative astrocytomas (10-year survival 78 versus 17 percent). Even for patients with infiltrative lesions, there appeared to be a plateau in the survival curve with some long-term survivors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important factor associated with a better prognosis was low tumor grade (WHO grade I). Other factors associated with a better prognosis included tumor location other than the cervical region, limited extent of tumor involvement along the spinal cord, and longer (&gt;180 days) duration of symptoms. Multivariate analysis could not demonstrate an advantage for more aggressive surgical resection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative RT did not affect outcomes in patients with pilocytic astrocytomas, although it did appear to improve the outcome for infiltrative astrocytomas.</p><p/><p>The initial step in the management of a patient with a symptomatic or enlarging presumed primary intramedullary spinal cord tumor is a surgical procedure for tissue diagnosis and resection to the maximum extent possible. Pilocytic astrocytomas can often be completely or near-completely resected without causing further neurologic deficits. Diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas are more infiltrative, and meaningful resection is often precluded by lack of clear tissue planes and risk of neurologic morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25</a>]. </p><p>Given the rarity of spinal cord diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas, there are no randomized trials to guide recommendations for subsequent treatment. Our approach is to use fractionated RT for low-grade tumors that are incompletely resected and for all high-grade tumors.</p><p>The role of chemotherapy in this disease is undefined. There are no reported trials of chemotherapy for spinal cord astrocytomas, and in our experience, chemotherapy has been ineffective. However, there are small observational series in the pediatric literature indicating that chemotherapy has at least some activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intramedullary spinal cord metastases are rare, although the increased use of MRI has resulted in more frequent recognition of such lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66684\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66684 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. About one-half of cases are associated with lung cancer. Breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and melanoma are other tumor sites that metastasize to the spinal cord.</p><p>Intramedullary metastases are usually observed in patients with widespread metastatic disease. The majority of patients also have brain and lung metastases, while leptomeningeal metastases are seen in approximately 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Patients typically present with weakness, numbness, and pain. The Brown-Sequard syndrome of hemicord dysfunction is a common initial finding and may raise suspicion of this diagnosis as compared to the more common epidural spinal cord compression. MRI is generally diagnostic. A CT-myelogram can be useful in patients who cannot undergo MRI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Brown-Sequard (hemi-cord) syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Management of intramedullary metastases generally consists of fractionated RT, which usually maintains but does not improve the pretreatment level of neurologic function. As with the treatment of brain metastases and epidural spinal cord compression, corticosteroids are used to diminish the effects of radiation-induced edema until RT is completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Approximately 90 percent of the tumors occur within the cranial fossa.

The tumors are frequently adherent to the spinal dura, requiring dural resection for complete removal, and also grow along intradural and extradural components of the nerve roots.</p><p>Spinal meningiomas are typically slowly growing, invasive lesions and may remodel or erode bone. Calcifications may be suggestive of the histologic diagnosis of meningioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Pathologically, spinal meningiomas demonstrate the same features seen with intracranial lesions. Meningiomas can have areas of increased cellularity or vascularity, xanthomatous components, and areas of hemorrhage. Rarely, the tumors may be considered malignant or aggressive if they demonstrate a proclivity to recur.</p><p>The usual treatment for spinal meningiomas is resection, and complete resection can often be achieved. The dural origin is generally cauterized and occasionally resected. Thoracic spinal roots may be sacrificed as necessary to obtain a complete resection; cervical and lumbar nerve roots are preserved whenever possible.</p><p>Subtotally resected lesions are generally followed expectantly for regrowth. Symptomatic recurrences are generally treated with further surgery. Radiation therapy or radiosurgery may be useful in patients with tumor regrowth that is not amenable to further resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-tumors/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve sheath tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nerve sheath tumors constitute about 25 percent of tumors arising in the intradural extramedullary space.
