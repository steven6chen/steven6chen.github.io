Potassium enters the body via oral intake or intravenous infusion, is largely stored in the cells, and is then excreted in the urine. The major causes of hyperkalemia are increased potassium release from the cells and, most often, reduced urinary potassium excretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58157 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will review the causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia. The clinical manifestations, treatment, and prevention of hyperkalemia, as well as a detailed discussion of hypoaldosteronism (an important cause of hyperkalemia), are presented elsewhere.

Total body potassium stores are approximately 3000 meq or more (50 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/kg</span> body weight) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast to sodium, which is the major cation in the extracellular fluid and has a much lower concentration in the cells, potassium is primarily an intracellular cation, with the cells containing approximately 98 percent of body potassium. The intracellular potassium concentration is approximately 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> compared with 4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in the extracellular fluid. The difference in distribution of the two cations is maintained by the Na-K-ATPase pump in the cell membrane, which pumps sodium out of and potassium into the cell in a 3:2 ratio. </p><p>The ratio of the potassium concentrations in the cells and the extracellular fluid is the major determinant of the resting membrane potential across the cell membrane, which sets the stage for the generation of the action potential that is essential for normal neural and muscle function. Thus, both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia can cause muscle paralysis and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H3819731\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Manifestations of hypokalemia'</a>.)</p><p>The causes of hyperkalemia can be best understood after a brief review of normal potassium homeostasis. The plasma potassium concentration is determined by the relationship among potassium intake, the distribution of potassium between the cells and the extracellular fluid, and urinary potassium excretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133155018\"><span class=\"h2\">Regulation of urinary potassium excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal individuals, dietary potassium is absorbed in the intestines and then largely excreted in the urine, a process that is primarily determined by potassium secretion by the principal cells in the two segments that follow the distal tubule: the connecting segment and cortical collecting tubule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. There are three major factors that stimulate principal cell potassium secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in plasma potassium concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> potassium intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in aldosterone secretion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced delivery of sodium and water to the distal potassium secretory sites </p><p/><p>Ingestion of a potassium load leads initially to the uptake of most of the excess potassium by cells in muscle and the liver, a process that is facilitated by insulin and the beta-2-adrenergic receptors, both of which increase the activity of Na-K-ATPase pumps in the cell membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Some of the ingested potassium remains in the extracellular fluid, producing a mild elevation in the plasma potassium concentration.</p><p>The increase in plasma potassium stimulates the secretion of aldosterone, which directly enhances sodium reabsorption and indirectly enhances potassium secretion in the principal cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693 \">figure 1</a>). The increase in sodium reabsorption is mediated primarily by an increase in the number of open sodium channels in the luminal membrane of the principal cells. The reabsorption of cationic sodium makes the lumen more electronegative, thereby enhancing the electrical gradient that promotes the secretion of potassium from the cells into the tubular fluid via potassium channels in the luminal membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693 \">figure 1</a>). Aldosterone also increases the number and activity of basolateral Na-K-ATPase pumps in principal cells, which facilitates both sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. The net effect is that most of the potassium load is excreted within six to eight hours.</p><p>Both cellular uptake and urinary excretion of an acute potassium load are impaired in patients with advanced acute or chronic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"#H270425989\" class=\"local\">'Acute and chronic kidney disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Potassium adaptation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperkalemia is a rare occurrence in normal individuals because the cellular and urinary responses prevent significant potassium accumulation in the extracellular fluid. Furthermore, the efficiency of potassium excretion is enhanced if potassium intake is increased, thereby allowing what might otherwise be a fatal potassium load to be tolerated. This phenomenon, called <strong>potassium adaptation</strong>, is mostly due to the ability to more rapidly excrete potassium in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p>Studies in rats have shown that potassium adaptation begins after a single potassium-containing meal. In one study, for example, rats fed a meal with potassium, when compared with rats given a potassium-free meal, were better able to excrete a potassium load several hours later, leading to a lesser rise in the plasma potassium concentration after the second potassium load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The net effect is that adapted animals excrete more potassium at a given plasma potassium concentration than animals that have not adapted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67129\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67129 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The efficacy of potassium adaptation in humans was demonstrated in a study evaluating the response of healthy adults to increasing potassium intake from 100 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Urinary potassium excretion rose to equal intake by the end of the second day, an effect that was accompanied by an elevation in both aldosterone secretion and the plasma potassium concentration (from 3.8 to 4.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50808\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50808 \">figure 3</a>). At day 20, urinary potassium excretion continued to match the high level of intake, but plasma aldosterone levels had returned to near baseline, and the plasma potassium concentration had fallen to 4.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50808\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50808 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>The increased efficiency of potassium excretion with potassium adaptation appears to be mediated by three changes that occur in the potassium-secreting principal cells in the connecting segment and cortical collecting tubule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693 \">figure 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An aldosterone-independent increase in the density and activity of apical secretory potassium channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased Na-K-ATPase activity, which enhances potassium uptake into the cell across the basolateral (peritubular) membrane, thereby increasing the size of the potassium secretory pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased activity of apical epithelial sodium channels (ENaC), through both aldosterone-independent and aldosterone-dependent mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/10,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,14</a>].

Acute hyperkalemia can rarely be induced (primarily in infants because of their small size) by the administration of potassium penicillin as an intravenous bolus, the accidental ingestion of a potassium-containing salt substitute, or the use of stored blood for exchange transfusions. In addition, moderate increases in potassium intake can be an important contributor to the development of hyperkalemia in patients with impaired potassium excretion due, for example, to hypoaldosteronism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Reduced urinary potassium excretion'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The net release of potassium from the cells (due to enhanced release or decreased entry) can, if large enough (eg, increased tissue breakdown), cause a transient elevation in the serum potassium concentration. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Increased potassium release from cells'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent hyperkalemia requires <strong>impaired urinary potassium excretion</strong>. In view of the factors described above, this is generally associated with a reduction in aldosterone secretion or responsiveness, acute or chronic kidney disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diminished delivery of sodium and water to the distal potassium secretory sites. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Reduced urinary potassium excretion'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Many of the causes of hyperkalemia are discussed in detail elsewhere and will only be listed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58157 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCREASED POTASSIUM RELEASE FROM CELLS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pseudohyperkalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudohyperkalemia refers to those conditions in which the elevation in the measured serum potassium concentration is usually due to potassium movement out of the cells during or after the blood specimen has been drawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The possible presence of pseudohyperkalemia should be suspected when there is no apparent cause for the hyperkalemia in an asymptomatic patient who has no electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H156422759\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique of blood drawing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudohyperkalemia can be seen in a variety of settings. The most common causes are related to the technique of blood drawing and can involve one or both of the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical trauma during venipuncture can result in the release of potassium from red cells and a characteristic reddish tint of the serum due to the concomitant release of hemoglobin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Red serum can also represent severe intravascular hemolysis rather than a hemolyzed specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. When intravascular hemolysis is present, the measured serum potassium may represent the true circulating value.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium moves out of muscle cells with exercise. As a result, repeated fist clenching during blood drawing can acutely raise the serum potassium concentration by more than 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in that forearm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>In these settings, venipuncture without a tourniquet, repeated fist clenching, or trauma will demonstrate the true serum potassium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If a tourniquet is required, the tourniquet should be released after the needle has entered the vein, followed by waiting for <strong>one to two minutes</strong> before drawing the blood sample.</p><p>Less common causes of an increase in serum potassium related to collection and storage include cooling of the sample and specimen deterioration because of prolonged length of storage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H156422766\"><span class=\"h3\">Other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several other settings in which pseudohyperkalemia can occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium moves out of platelets after clotting has occurred. Thus, the serum potassium concentration normally exceeds the true value in plasma by 0.1 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although this difference in normal individuals is not clinically important, the increase in the measured serum potassium concentration can be much greater in normokalemic patients with thrombocytosis, rising by approximately 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span> elevation in the platelet count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In one study, hyperkalemia in a serum sample occurred in 34 percent of patients with a platelet count above <span class=\"nowrap\">500,000/microL</span> compared with 9 percent of patients with a platelet count less than <span class=\"nowrap\">250,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The concentration of potassium in plasma (obtained by centrifugation of heparinized, unclotted blood) was normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A similar phenomenon has been reported in acute myeloid leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, <strong>hypokalemia</strong> is more common in this disorder, due to movement of potassium into rapidly proliferating cells after the blood has been drawn (pseudohypokalemia) or to renal potassium wasting (true hypokalemia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H896838\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Hypokalemia'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High white blood cell counts <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;120,000/microL)</span> caused by chronic lymphocytic leukemia can lead to falsely elevated potassium concentrations due to cell fragility. Unlike thrombocytosis, this form of pseudohyperkalemia occurs in<strong> both</strong> serum and plasma samples and may be more prominent when blood is sampled in heparinized tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Centrifugation of a heparinized tube causes in vitro cell destruction and release of potassium as these cells are freely suspended in plasma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Accurate assessment of the potassium concentration in this setting can be achieved by allowing clotting to separate serum (plasma without the clotting factors) from cells <strong>before</strong> centrifugation. The fibrin clot entraps and protects fragile leukemic cells, minimizing cell lysis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pseudohyperkalemia in patients with very high white blood cell counts due to leukemia or lymphoma has also been reported after mechanical disruption of white blood cells during transport of blood samples via pneumatic tube systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium can move out of red cells after the specimen is collected in patients with hereditary (familial) forms of pseudohyperkalemia, which are caused by an increase in the passive potassium permeability of erythrocytes. Pseudohyperkalemia may be the only manifestation of the disorder, or it may be accompanied by abnormal red cell morphology (eg, stomatocytosis), varying degrees of hemolysis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perinatal edema in specific kindreds. This genetically heterogeneous condition is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis#H1905393240\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stomatocytosis and xerocytosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with metabolic acidosis other than organic acidosis due to lactic acidosis or ketoacidosis, buffering of excess hydrogen ions in the cells leads to potassium movement into the extracellular fluid, a transcellular shift that is obligated in part by the need to maintain electroneutrality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68866\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68866 \">figure 4</a>).

In these settings, the measured serum potassium concentration may be normal or reduced despite the presence of metabolic acidosis. However, the plasma potassium will be higher than it would have been if the same degree of potassium loss had occurred in the absence of metabolic acidosis.

A possible contributory factor in both disorders is the ability of the organic anion and the hydrogen ion to enter into the cell via a sodium-organic anion cotransporter. The transport mechanisms involved and how they minimize potassium movement out of the cells are discussed in detail elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>As described below, the development of hyperkalemia in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis is primarily due to insulin deficiency and hyperosmolality, not acidemia.

The effect of respiratory acidosis on the plasma potassium concentration has been primarily evaluated in acute rather than chronic respiratory acidosis. In a review of the available human data, respiratory acidosis produced <strong>no</strong> significant effect on the plasma potassium, although the degree of acidemia in the reviewed studies was usually mild (fall in plasma pH about 0.1); in addition, the increase in plasma potassium for a given reduction in pH was smaller when the fall in pH was induced by respiratory as compared with metabolic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The effect of respiratory acidosis on the plasma potassium is greater with more severe acidosis and with a longer duration of acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The mechanisms responsible for the lesser increase in plasma potassium in respiratory acidosis compared with metabolic acidosis are not well defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Studies in animal models of acute respiratory acidosis have shown variable increases in plasma potassium with the severity and duration of the acidosis. The following illustrates the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study in dogs, severe acute respiratory acidosis (a decrease in mean plasma pH from 7.4 to 7) had no effect on the plasma potassium at 10 minutes but, at two and six hours, the plasma potassium had increased from 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (approximately 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per 0.1 reduction in plasma pH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pseudohyperkalemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Metabolic acidosis &ndash; In patients with metabolic acidosis other than organic acidosis due to lactic acidosis or ketoacidosis, buffering of excess hydrogen ions in the cells leads to potassium movement into the extracellular fluid, a transcellular shift that is obligated in part by the need to maintain electroneutrality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68866\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68866 \">figure 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic acidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and hyperosmolality &ndash; Insulin promotes potassium entry into cells, minimizing the rise in the serum potassium concentration induced by concurrent potassium intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52424\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52424 \">figure 5</a>). In uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, the combination of insulin <span class=\"nowrap\">deficiency/resistance</span> and hyperosmolality induced by hyperglycemia frequently leads to hyperkalemia even though there may be marked potassium depletion due to urinary losses caused by the osmotic diuresis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64207\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64207 \">figure 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and hyperosmolality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased tissue catabolism &ndash; Any cause of increased tissue breakdown leads to the release of intracellular potassium into the extracellular fluid. Hyperkalemia can occur in this setting, particularly if renal failure is also present. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Increased tissue catabolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Beta blockers &ndash; Beta blockers interfere with the beta-2-adrenergic facilitation of potassium uptake by the cells, particularly after a potassium load (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62538\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62538 \">figure 7</a>). An increase in serum potassium is primarily seen with nonselective beta blockers (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other causes of hyperkalemia due to increased potassium release from cells include exercise, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, red cell transfusion, and various drugs including digitalis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The four major causes of hyperkalemia due to reduced urinary potassium secretion are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58157 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Reduced urinary potassium excretion'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduced aldosterone secretion &ndash; Any cause of decreased aldosterone release, such as that induced by hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism or certain drugs, can diminish the efficiency of potassium secretion and lead to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis (called type 4 renal tubular acidosis [RTA]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82440\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82440 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Reduced aldosterone secretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduced response to aldosterone (aldosterone resistance) &ndash; There are a number of causes of hyperkalemia that are due to a reduced response to aldosterone, also called aldosterone or mineralocorticoid resistance. The most common are the administration of potassium-sparing diuretics and acute and chronic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"#H774689278\" class=\"local\">'Reduced response to aldosterone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduced distal sodium and water delivery &ndash; Potassium secretion can be impaired if there is a substantial reduction in sodium and water delivery to the potassium secretory sites in the distal nephron (connecting segment and cortical collecting tubule). The most common cause is reduced effective arterial blood volume, including any cause of true volume depletion (eg, gastrointestinal or renal losses) as well as heart failure and cirrhosis in which decreased tissue perfusion is due to a reduced cardiac output and vasodilation, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H270420126\" class=\"local\">'Reduced distal sodium and water delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute and chronic kidney disease &ndash; In patients with acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia is most prevalent in oliguric patients who also have increased potassium release from cells due, for example, to rhabdomyolysis or tumor lysis syndrome. In patients with chronic kidney disease, the ability to excrete dietary potassium without the development of hyperkalemia generally persists as long as both the secretion of and responsiveness to aldosterone are intact and distal delivery of sodium and water are maintained. However, moderate increases in potassium intake can be an important contributor to the development of hyperkalemia in patients with impaired potassium excretion due to renal insufficiency, particularly in combination with other predisposing factors (hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor therapy, etc). (See <a href=\"#H270425989\" class=\"local\">'Acute and chronic kidney disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other causes of impaired urinary potassium excretion include Gordon's syndrome and ureterojejunostomy. (See <a href=\"#H270419983\" class=\"local\">'Other mechanisms of impaired potassium secretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of the patient with hyperkalemia usually begins with a careful history, evaluation for clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia such as muscle weakness and characteristic changes on the electrocardiogram, and laboratory testing for the causes of hyperkalemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F109740\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109740 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H156422221\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudohyperkalemia should be suspected when there is no apparent cause for the hyperkalemia in an asymptomatic patient who has no clinical or electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalemia. (See <a href=\"#H156422773\" class=\"local\">'Exclude pseudohyperkalemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of pseudohyperkalemia or recent potassium administration, an acute rise in serum potassium is often due to increased release of potassium from the cells, and the cause is identified from the history and laboratory data. (See <a href=\"#H156422795\" class=\"local\">'Acute rise in serum potassium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the ability of healthy individuals to handle large potassium loads with only a small rise in serum potassium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50808\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50808 \">figure 3</a>), the most common causes of persistent hyperkalemia are associated with impaired urinary potassium excretion due to reduced secretion of or response to aldosterone, acute or chronic kidney disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> effective arterial blood volume depletion. Measurement of 24-hour urinary potassium excretion is of <strong>limited utility</strong> in patients with persistent <strong>stable</strong> hyperkalemia, and the transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) is <strong>not</strong> a reliable test for the diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Patients with persistent hyperkalemia in whom the etiology has not been identified should be evaluated for the presence and cause of hypoaldosteronism. (See <a href=\"#H873885\" class=\"local\">'Persistent hyperkalemia'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Boddy K, King PC, Hume R, Weyers E.
