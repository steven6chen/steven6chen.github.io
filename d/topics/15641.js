Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors are rare, comprising only 1.2 percent of all primary ovarian cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In contrast with epithelial ovarian cancer, most patients with malignant sex cord-stromal tumors are diagnosed with early-stage disease; the tumors are generally considered to be low-grade malignant neoplasms.</p><p>Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors constitute less than 0.5 percent of ovarian neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. They may behave in a benign or malignant fashion, which correlates with the degree of differentiation in an individual case. Approximately 75 percent occur in women under the age of 40 years (mean age at diagnosis is 25), but they occur in all age groups. The neoplasms are characterized by the presence of testicular structures that produce androgens. This can result in virilization, although not all of these neoplasms are functionally active.</p><p>Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors of the Sertoli-stromal cell type are reviewed here. This category includes Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (androblastomas) as well as pure Sertoli cell or Leydig cell tumors. An overview of sex cord-stromal tumors and other types of sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary (Sertoli-stromal cell tumors and tumors with granulosa and Sertoli-Leydig elements), as well as epithelial ovarian cancer, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary: Granulosa-stromal cell tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-tumors-with-granulosa-and-sertoli-leydig-elements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary: Tumors with granulosa and Sertoli-Leydig elements&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Histopathology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3019423\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two gene mutations associated with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors have been reported, and both may be clinically relevant. <em>FOXL2</em> is a somatic missense point mutation that was initially reported to be present in granulosa cell tumors of the ovary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Subsequently, the same group analyzed this marker in a larger series of sex cord-stromal ovarian tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The authors found that <em>FOXL2</em> is a relatively sensitive and highly specific marker for this tumor type. <em>FOXL2</em> immunostaining was present in almost all sex cord-stromal tumors with a <em>FOXL2</em> mutation and in a majority of tumors without a mutation. Importantly, only 50 percent of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors expressed <em>FOXL2</em>. However, together with alpha-inhibin and calretinin, <em>FOXL2 </em>forms an immunomarker panel that will aid in the diagnosis of a sex cord-stromal ovarian tumor.</p><p>The other mutation, <em>DICER1,</em> is a germline mutation. Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a childhood cancer that is part of a familial tumor syndrome found to be associated with germline mutations in <em>DICER1</em>. Schultz et al [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] reported that among 296 kindreds including 325 children with PPB, there were three children with both PPB and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. Furthermore, among family members of PPB patients, the investigators identified six sex cord-stromal ovarian tumors, including three Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors and one Sertoli cell tumor. Therefore, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors may be a manifestation of the familial PPB syndrome and may be the initial presentation of <em>DICER1</em> mutations within a family. Somatic <em>DICER1 </em>mutations are also common in Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. In one report, <em>DICER1</em> mutations in the RNase IIIb domain were found in 26 of 43 (60 percent) of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, including four tumors with additional germline <em>DICER1 </em>mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Grossly, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors typically form a firm, solid, lobulated mass with a smooth external surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Well differentiated neoplasms with retiform components (ie, with papillae resembling the rete testis and rete ovarii) are often soft and spongy, while poorly differentiated subtypes may have areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The retiform pattern has been associated with hepatocytic differentiation and elevation in serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Microscopically, well differentiated neoplasms are composed of hollow or solid tubules surrounded by a fibrous stroma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65893\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65893 \">picture 1</a>). Sertoli cells line the tubules, and Leydig cells are observed within the stroma. Dense cellular areas with increasing numbers of mitoses occur in intermediate or poorly differentiated neoplasms. Five subtypes are identified: well differentiated, intermediate differentiation, poorly differentiated, retiform, and mixed. Most are histologically low-grade.</p><p>Some Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors contain heterologous elements, or other tissue types, such as mucinous (eg, gastrointestinal) epithelium, cartilage, and skeletal muscle. The presence of nonepithelial tissues is associated with a poorer prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of these neoplasms present during the second and third decades of life. Most are unilateral, confined to the ovary, and large (average 16 cm in maximal diameter) unless discovered incidentally.</p><p>Androgens and androgen precursors (eg, 17 hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, androstenedione) are often produced by these tumors, resulting in virilization (oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, breast atrophy, hirsutism, deepening voice, male pattern baldness, acne, and clitoral enlargement) in at least one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Less commonly, estrogenic manifestations are observed, presumably related to peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens or a rare estrogen-secreting tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Production of either inhibin or alpha-fetoprotein has also been reported in a small number of cases of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor.</p><p>Pure Sertoli cell tumors are usually estrogenic and may also secrete renin, leading to refractory hypertension and hypokalemia. In addition, these tumors may be associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Pure Leydig cell tumors are androgen secreting; only a few cases have been reported. Virtually all of these rare tumors are unilateral and confined to the ovary at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Women without hormonal manifestations usually present with abdominal pain or increasing abdominal girth. Almost all symptomatic patients have a palpable adnexal mass.</p><p>Despite an average size of 16 cm at presentation, only 2 to 3 percent of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors have demonstrable extraovarian spread at the time of diagnosis; less than 20 percent display malignant behavior (ie, metastasize or recur) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast to granulosa cell tumors, early recurrence is typical of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, with only 6 to 7 percent of recurrences developing after five years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary: Granulosa-stromal cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Recurrences are most common with poorly differentiated tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of Sertoli-Leydig tumors is made by histology at time of surgical excision. Preoperatively, a Sertoli-Leydig tumor should be suspected based upon the presence of a large adnexal mass, if accompanied by the signs of virilization described in the preceding section.</p><p>Serum testosterone levels are invariably elevated when virilization is present, and selective venous catheterization has documented the ovary as the site of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In addition, immunostaining was positive for testosterone in eight Sertoli-Leydig tumors analyzed, including a limited number of tumors from patients without clinical signs or symptoms of androgen excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The Leydig cells, as anticipated, were shown to be the cell producing testosterone. Following cytoreductive surgery, the serum testosterone levels are rapidly cleared from the circulation and have been reported on occasion to again increase as a function of the burden of recurrent metastatic disease.</p><p>A histologic diagnosis is often made only upon final pathologic evaluation. Since these are rare tumors, many expert gynecologic pathologists will not provide a definite diagnosis based upon intraoperative frozen section examination.</p><p>Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is produced by some Sertoli-Leydig tumors. In making a definitive diagnosis, immunostaining of the tumor may show AFP in Leydig cells (most frequently) or Sertoli cells. In terms of the serum measurement, the rare ovarian tumors that classically produce AFP are yolk sac tumors and embryonal carcinomas. Thus, if AFP is measured preoperatively and found to be elevated, the top diagnoses in differential diagnosis would be yolk sac tumors and embryonal carcinomas, rather than Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. If a histologic diagnosis of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor is made postoperatively, then AFP should be ordered. If elevated, it can be a serum marker that is monitored during surveillance or during treatment for newly diagnosed or recurrent disease.

Sertoli-stromal cell tumors are staged surgically according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) ovarian cancer staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and complete surgical staging is recommended for women who have completed childbearing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75194\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75194 \">table 2</a>). When preservation of fertility or avoidance of exogenous hormone replacement is desired, unilateral oophorectomy can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Lymph node metastases are rare, and lymphadenectomy may be omitted during the staging procedure if the diagnosis is made on intraoperative frozen-section examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend a course of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery for these patients, although there is no standard regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The available data evaluating the benefit of chemotherapy are scant, with most of the literature consisting of isolated case reports.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series included three patients with stage IC Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, two poorly differentiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-sertoli-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].
