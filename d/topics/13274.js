Like other muscles, they can become weakened over time, as a result of vaginal childbirth, surgery, and aging. People with bladder control problems, such as urine leakage, can improve urinary control through pelvic muscle exercises (also called Kegel exercises).</p><p>If you want to use pelvic muscle exercises, speak to your health care provider to determine if the exercises would be helpful, and also to receive instructions about how to perform the exercises correctly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, you will need to learn which muscles to tighten. To do this, imagine you are sitting on a marble (do not use a real marble). Then tighten your pelvic muscles to lift that imaginary marble off the chair. Tighten and relax your pelvic muscles several times. That way you will learn which muscles are the ones you should tighten. When you do the exercises, you should NOT stop the flow of your urine, because this isn't good for your urination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After you learn which muscles to tighten, you can do the exercises in any position (sitting in a chair or lying down). You do not need to do them while you are in the bathroom. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second, hold the pelvic muscle contraction approximately 8 to 10 seconds, and then relax the muscles; relaxing the muscles is as important as contracting. In the beginning, it may not be possible to hold the contraction for more than one second.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Perform 8 to 12 exercises three times per day. Try to do this every day, but no less than three or four times a week. Continue this regimen for at least 15 to 20 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over time, try to hold the contraction harder and for a longer time. You will need to continue these exercises indefinitely to have a lasting effect, similar to other forms of exercise.</p><p/><p>Some people benefit from working with a physical therapist or bladder health nurse to receive more detailed instructions and to ensure that you use the correct technique. In addition, these providers may use biofeedback to improve your exercise technique and strength. Biofeedback uses a computer monitor to show you as the muscles contract and relax, and also indicates if you use the wrong muscles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE RESULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have shown that, if done correctly, pelvic muscle exercises can be effective in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you leak urine with <span class=\"nowrap\">coughing/laughing/sneezing</span>. Contract your muscles when you are about to <span class=\"nowrap\">cough/laugh/sneeze</span> to avoid leaking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have a sudden urge to run to the bathroom, sit or stand still and contract your pelvic muscles. After the urge diminishes, you can then proceed to the toilet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have mild fecal leakage (leakage of stool).</p><p/><p>These exercises are less helpful for people with severe leakage with <span class=\"nowrap\">laughing/coughing/sneezing</span>. Exercises are not helpful at all for people with other types of urinary incontinence, including overflow incontinence (when the bladder cannot empty completely and leaks when it becomes overly full). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary incontinence in women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-treatments-for-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary incontinence treatments for women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most people notice an improvement after three to four months of practicing pelvic muscle exercises. If these exercises are not helpful, please speak with a healthcare provider. Other treatments are available and may be recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=8403\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
