All of these conditions are common and can be temporally related, but whether the association is causal has not been definitively proven in clinical studies. In addition to being causal, a number of additional possible relationships between these entities might exist:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache may be coincidental with stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache may be a consequence of stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke and cerebrovascular lesions may have clinical features of migraine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache or migraine may increase the risk of stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine may have clinical features of stroke</p><p/><p>Further modifications are likely as knowledge of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of these relationships advances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Headache coincidental with stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headache or migraine may occur coincidentally with stroke since both are common conditions. With aging, the prevalence of migraine decreases, while that of stroke increases. In addition, stroke risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease are more common in older age groups. Therefore, younger patients are much more likely than older patients to have migraine as the only stroke risk factor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Headache due to stroke or vascular disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemorrhagic stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headache at or near the onset of stroke occurs almost invariably in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Headache is less frequent with other stroke mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-migraine-and-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), headache may occur acutely at stroke onset, or may occur a bit later (within hours of onset) as the hematoma gradually expands and begins to compress pain sensitive intracranial structures such as larger arteries and the meninges. In some cases of ICH, headache may not be present at all. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Sentinel headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A premonitory or sentinel headache may occur before subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

In one prospective study of 284 patients with acute ischemic stroke, concomitant headache during the early phase of stroke was reported by 38 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-migraine-and-stroke/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although the cause is often unclear, several plausible mechanisms have been postulated including vascular dilation as a homeostatic response to ischemia and direct arterial irritation by thrombus, embolism, or dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-migraine-and-stroke/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One study using MRI lesion mapping found that infarctions in the insular cortex were significantly associated with headache, perhaps related to the role of this region in pain processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-migraine-and-stroke/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Headache is uncommon in lacunar stroke syndromes.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-cerebral-vasoconstriction-syndromes#H185045483\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical presentation of RCVS is usually dramatic with sudden, severe &quot;thunderclap&quot; headaches that simulate aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, in patients with RCVS, thunderclap headaches often recur over a span of one to four weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-cerebral-vasoconstriction-syndromes#H185045495\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Despite the presence of widespread cerebral vasoconstriction, the admission brain scan may be normal. In the ensuing days, many patients go on to develop complications such as ischemic stroke, convexal (nonaneurysmal) subarachnoid hemorrhage, lobar hemorrhage, and reversible brain edema, alone or in combination. Cerebral angiographic abnormalities are dynamic and progress proximally, resulting in a &quot;sausage on a string&quot; appearance of the circle of Willis arteries and their branches. These abnormalities resolve spontaneously (without specific therapy) over a few weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-cerebral-vasoconstriction-syndromes#H212537519\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical outcome is benign in most patients. Rare patients develop severe irreversible deficits or death from progressive strokes or cerebral edema. Recurrence of an episode of RCVS is rare.

Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) may be associated with migraine attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-migraine-and-stroke/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. One literature review of case studies found a correlation between the side of the head with the AVM and the side affected by unilateral headache, with a similar correlation for lateralized auras [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-migraine-and-stroke/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Migraine attacks have also been associated with the syndrome of Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).

Various stroke subtypes including ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral venous thrombosis can mimic migraine attacks.</p><p>Cervical internal carotid artery dissection may occasionally present as a migraine mimic with visual scintillating scotomata [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-migraine-and-stroke/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. One study of 161 patients found that nearly 70 percent of cervical carotid and vertebral dissections were associated with headache, and headache was the initial symptom in 33 to 47 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-migraine-and-stroke/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. An earlier study found that 19 of 21 patients with angiographically documented carotid dissection had ipsilateral head pain in one or more regions such as the orbit, frontal region, and side of the head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-migraine-and-stroke/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The head pain was typically acute and severe, and neck pain occurred as well in 12 patients. About three quarters of the 21 patients had ischemic events related to the dissection, with the headache preceding the ischemic symptoms in about half.</p><p>The relationship of dissection with headache is made even more complicated because about one-half of patients with cervicocephalic dissection have a prior history of migraine.

Typical migraine auras develop gradually over 5 to 20 minutes and last less than one hour; the most common types involve homonymous visual disturbances. There is usually little clinical difficulty recognizing these auras as manifestations of migraine when the aura is brief and precedes a headache. In addition to visual auras, other common types of migraine aura manifest as sensory or language disturbances.

However, the absolute increase in the risk of stroke is small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-migraine-and-stroke/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In addition, migraine is associated with a small increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-migraine-and-stroke/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].
