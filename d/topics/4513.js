In a prospective study, 1404 urban female adolescents (age 15 to 19 years) were educated about reversible contraception, with an emphasis on the benefits of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC); provided with their choice of reversible contraception at no cost; and followed for two to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Nearly three-quarters of participants chose an intrauterine device (IUD) or contraceptive implant. Compared with sexually active United States teenagers in 2008, study participants had lower rates of pregnancy (34.0 versus 158.5 per 1000), birth (19.4 versus 94.0 per 1000), and abortion (9.7 versus 41.5 per 1000).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1548498967\"><span class=\"h2\">Confidentiality and parental consent</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confidentiality</strong> &ndash; Assuring confidentiality is the first step in establishing basic trust and respect between the clinician and the adolescent patient. The adolescent should be given an opportunity to provide her medical history and to obtain gynecologic and sexual information directly from the clinician. The importance and the limits of confidentiality should be discussed with the adolescent and her parents at the initial visit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confidentiality in adolescent health care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adolescent-sexuality#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adolescent sexuality&quot;, section on 'Confidentiality'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The concept of conditional confidentiality can be introduced to the accompanying parent or guardian as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">&quot;I would like to make this visit a positive experience for your daughter. It is important to respect an adolescent's privacy as a normal part of her growing up. I would first like to have the opportunity to review health information with you, and then I would like to review health information with your daughter alone. Usually, whatever is discussed between my teenage patients and me is confidential, except in certain situations, such as if she has thoughts of suicide, thoughts of physically harming someone, or reports she has been or is being physically or sexually abused. If you feel you need to know more about what she and I have discussed, I strongly encourage you and your daughter to talk to each other directly.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A young adolescent may prefer to have her mother present throughout the office visit, particularly if the mother is aware of the teenager's sexual behavior and wants the teenager to use a contraceptive method. Even if this is the case, it is important to encourage independent time with the adolescent to obtain a more detailed history about other possible high-risk behaviors.

The need for parental consent also may be related to state or federal funding for hormonal contraception in local clinics.

However, adolescents and young women who have health insurance through their parents may be reluctant to access such services unless their privacy can be assured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, challenges to this mandate may arise for adolescents in states that opted out of Medicaid Expansion or when adolescents with an insurance plan must seek an in-network provider experienced in offering highly effective contraceptive services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Adolescents may have misperceptions about their risk of getting pregnant (eg, if they have had unprotected sexual intercourse and did not get pregnant, they may believe that they are unable to become pregnant). Adolescents may mistakenly believe that they must have a pelvic examination and cervical inspection before initiation of any method of contraception; this evaluation is necessary only for intrauterine contraception. Both adolescents and clinicians may have misperceptions about the effectiveness of, contraindications to, preinitiation evaluation for, or adverse effects of various methods of contraception.</p><p>It is important to dispel misperceptions of adverse effects, particularly of hormonal methods (eg, the contraceptive implant, oral contraceptive pills, depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> [DMPA]), when discussing contraceptive methods with adolescent patients. Examples of adolescent concerns include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weight gain</strong> &ndash; Many adolescents are concerned that hormonal contraceptives cause weight gain. However, a causal relationship has not been established. The effects of hormonal contraception on weight are discussed separately.

However, by the time of menarche, most female adolescents have already undergone their growth spurt and achieved approximately &ge;95 percent of their adult height. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;, section on 'Growth spurt'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Birth defects and infertility</strong> &ndash; Adolescents may be concerned that hormonal contraception may cause birth defects or infertility. However, evidence to support these associations is lacking.

From a developmental perspective, sexually active girls in early adolescence (10 through 14 years) have difficulty planning events and activities; they often have an idealistic point of view, think about situations in a concrete or literal way, and live in the moment. Implementing a contraceptive method that requires planning and forethought to prevent the &quot;possibility&quot; of pregnancy is difficult at this stage without monitoring and adult support. Girls in middle adolescence (15 through 18 years) and late adolescence (&gt;18 years) are more capable of higher-level planning, decision making, and problem solving, skills essential to effective contraceptive behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/7,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,26</a>].
