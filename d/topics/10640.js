They are positioned as sentinels at the body's portals of entry within mucosal membranes lining the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital systems, throughout the dermis, and surrounding blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. They are found in lower invertebrates as well as vertebrates, suggesting that they serve a fundamental role within the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Mast cells have long been recognized for their participation in allergic disease, including asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and anaphylaxis. However, they also have a variety of protective and regenerative roles throughout the body.</p><p>The anatomic location, development, cellular identification, and physiologic roles of mast cells are discussed in this topic review. Their activating and inhibitory surface receptors, signal transduction, and mediators are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Surface receptors and signal transduction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-derived-mediators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell-derived mediators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The contributions of mast cells to specific atopic diseases and mastocytosis are discussed elsewhere.

Their numbers and densities are highest at interfaces between the internal and external environments where they can respond to foreign organisms and antigens, providing a sentinel function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Sites include the dermis, gut mucosa and submucosa, conjunctiva, pulmonary alveoli and airways, and the atrial appendage of the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>]. Dermal mast cells are often located in close proximity to blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics, with an estimated density of 7000 to 20,000 mast cells per cubic millimeter of skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>]. From this strategic location, they can influence the function of vascular structures, monitor the blood for inflammatory and infectious changes, capture circulating immunoglobulin E (IgE) molecules onto their surface, and distribute their mediators throughout the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Mast cells are found in the choroid plexus of the brain and in the vascular bed of the meninges. Low numbers of mast cells are found in the kidneys and bone marrow.</p><p>Mast cell numbers increase at inflammatory sites in different diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, psoriasis, rheumatoid synovitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, cancer, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, and cardiomyopathy, although it is not clear if their role in these diseases is pathogenic, regenerative, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/15-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic roles'</a> below.)</p><p>Mast cell numbers also increase dramatically at multiple anatomic sites in the rare condition known as mastocytosis and are directly responsible for the pathologic changes observed in this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COLLECTION AND CULTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cells are challenging to collect and study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Mast cell progenitors (MCps) pass transiently through the circulation, at which point they are difficult to distinguish from other cell types. In humans, the majority of the bloodborne progenitors appear to not have made a commitment to the mast cell lineage. Thereafter, committed progenitors and mature cells reside in tissues.</p><p>For studies on mast cell function, mature human mast cells can be isolated from solid tissues and cultured through a relatively complicated series of enzymatic and other techniques. Alternatively, transformed human mast cells can be used, although the cellular functions of these cells may be abnormal. Progenitor cells can be collected from human cord blood or peripheral blood and developed in culture, although the resultant cells differ significantly from natural tissue mast cells.</p><p>Because of the difficulties in collecting human mast cells, mast cells from mice are often utilized instead. However, the distribution and phenotype of murine mast cells are substantively different from that of human cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Mice have much lower numbers of mature mast cells in their tissues but large numbers in the peritoneal cavity, whereas humans normally do not have significant numbers of peritoneal mast cells. Mouse mast cell precursors can be obtained from bone marrow and cultured to relative maturity with the same issues regarding the resultant cells that are present with human cell cultures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVELOPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cells arise from pluripotential CD34+ stem cells that reside in the bone marrow and spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. They differentiate along the myeloid pathway, sharing intermediates with <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages</span> and granulocytes. When mast cell progenitors (MCps) leave the hematopoietic tissues, some are committed to a mast cell lineage (eg, in mice) and others appear to have multilineage capabilities (eg, in humans) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. They are then influenced by various signals (only some of which have been characterized), which direct their migration out of the circulation and into tissues where they subsequently mature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. They display considerable variability across tissues compared with other cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Kit and stem cell factor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important growth factor for mast cells is stem cell factor (SCF), which is constitutively produced in both a soluble and membrane-bound form by stromal cells, particularly endothelial cells and fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. SCF is also called kit ligand (KL) or steel factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/35,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38-41</a>]. The surface receptor for SCF, the receptor tyrosine kinase kit (CD117) generated from the gene <em>KIT</em>, is expressed by hematopoietic stem cells and is maintained during myeloid differentiation. It is, thus, an early marker for mast cell precursors. Mast cells continue to express kit throughout the lifetime of the cell, unlike most other cells (including basophils), which lose this marker during their development and become unresponsive to SCF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/1,29,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29,42</a>].</p><p>SCF and kit were previously believed to be critical for the development of mast cells, and this seems true for the appearance of the mature, tissue-resident mast cell. However, the maturation of mast cell precursors to pre-mast cells may not be totally dependent on kit as evidenced by the survival of these immature forms in patients undergoing therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, a drug that inhibits signaling through kit and other tyrosine kinases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This interpretation was supported by in vitro developmental studies and is consistent with development of immature but not mature cells in mice in the absence of SCF-kit signaling. Note that imatinib does not inhibit mutated KIT, in particular at the D816V position, and early expression of KIT on pre-mast cells may not be accessible to imatinib.</p><p>With the above noted limited exception, SCF has been shown in vitro to participate in nearly every stage of growth and differentiation of mast cells, including chemotaxis, adhesion, survival, proliferation, and differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This global influence, combined with the constitutive and widespread production of SCF, results in the ubiquitous presence of mast cells throughout the tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other growth and differentiation factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous other factors (in addition to SCF) have been shown to influence proliferation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> differentiation of mast cells. Both human and mouse MCps respond in vitro to several of the T helper type 2 (Th2) cell cytokines, including interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-9 (IL-9), and interleukin-10 (IL-10), although responses to these cytokines are better studied for mouse mast cells than for human mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Defects in the gene for phosphatase and tensin homolog (<em>PTEN</em>) can also result in hyperproliferation and heightened allergic responses in mice, although the prevalence of these defects in humans has not been extensively studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Migration into tissues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exit of mast cell precursors from the circulation and the accumulation of differentiated mast cells in various tissues depends upon the interaction with endothelial cells initially and then with various tissue factors via adhesion molecules, including integrins and immunoglobulin supergene family receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. As an example, murine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) exposed to the matrix protein, vitronectin, will spontaneously adhere and increase their proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. A more general discussion of leukocyte movement and trafficking can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion in the pathogenesis of inflammation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Based principally on studies in the mouse with some limited support from human investigations, homing of MCps is highly organ-specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/47,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,51,52</a>]. In the mouse, MCp expression of the integrin alpha-4-beta-7 directs migration of MCps into normal intestine and inflamed lung. Alpha-4-beta-7 recognizes mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1, CD106), both of which are present on normal vascular endothelium in Peyer's patches and lamina propria, while only VCAM-1 is found on vascular epithelium in the lung. The expression of the interleukin-8 (IL-8) receptor on both MCps and the vascular endothelium directs the specific migration of the precursors to the intestinal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. These processes appear to occur constitutively, with MCps demonstrating a tissue half-life in the intestine of approximately one week. These mechanisms result in the accumulation of a large pool of MCps, especially after inflammation, that is poised to mature into effector mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/49,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,53</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the intestine, the submucosa of the mouse lung contains few mast cells and MCps in the absence of inflammation. With allergic inflammation, a rapid (within three days) and large (&gt;25-fold) influx of MCps occurs, directed by alpha-4-beta-1 and alpha-4-beta-7 integrins on the MCps and by VCAM-1 and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) on the endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/49,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,54</a>]. Studies indicate that this large pool of MCps gives rise to the mast cells that are found associated with the bronchial epithelium in the mouse and in association with both bronchial epithelium and smooth muscle in the human with chronic inflammation, such as asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Studies in the mouse suggest a tissue-dependent variable lifespan for these inflammation-induced mature cells of anywhere from one week to several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemoattractants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cell chemotaxis occurs in response to a variety of growth and differentiation factors, such as SCF and interleukin-3 (IL-3), and to numerous chemokines. The C-C chemokines RANTES (<strong>r</strong>egulated on <strong>a</strong>ctivation <strong>n</strong>ormal <strong>T</strong> expressed and <strong>s</strong>ecreted, CCL5) and CCL2 or MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1) cause directed migration of cultured human mast cells and mouse BMMCs on vitronectin and laminin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Also, CCL3 or MIP-1-alpha (macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha) and CXCL4 or PF-4 (platelet factor-4) elicit migration of mouse BMMCs after Fc-epsilon-RI activation on laminin, vitronectin, and fibronectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The murine IL-8 homologs (CXCL1 and CXCL2) acting on the single IL-8 receptor in the mouse, CXCR2, control homing of MCps to the small intestine of the mouse as noted above, and this receptor also controls the chemotaxis of a human mast cell line in response to human IL-8 (CXCL8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The neurotransmitter serotonin, acting through a serotonin receptor, is chemotactic for human mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Mature phenotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most investigational work on mast cells has been performed in mouse models to enable more sophisticated analyses. Using these models, subtypes of mature mast cells have been identified, which differ in location, mediator production, granule contents (and therefore staining properties), and behavior upon activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The properties of two prominent subtypes found in the mouse are presented here. It is not certain to what degree these findings apply to human mast cells. There are many similarities, but there are also differences, some of which may be due to the fact that the mice are housed in pathogen-limited environments, unlike the human situation.</p><p>In the mouse intestine, two primary forms of mature mast cells have been identified: murine mucosal mast cells (mMMCs), which appear mostly with inflammation, and murine connective tissue mast cells (mCTMCs), which are constitutive in most tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In the small intestine, these differ most dramatically in their expression of the secretory granule proteases with proteases 1 and 2 associated with mast cells in the mucosal epithelium and proteases 4, 5, 6, 7, and the carboxypeptidase associated with mast cells in submucosal sites. However, this difference is tissue-dependent, as this does not hold true in the mouse lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Differences in eicosanoid synthesis have also been noted, with the mMMC producing both cysteinyl leukotrienes as well as prostanoids, while the mCTMC produces principally prostanoids upon activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Similarly, in the human, the principal division has been based upon secretory granule contents. The mast cells whose granules contain mostly tryptase (MC-T) are more prominent in the mucosa, while those containing tryptase, chymase, and carboxypeptidase A (MC-TC) are more prominent in the submucosal and connective tissue sites. In addition, the MC-T is the cell type depleted in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, indicating it is T cell-dependent like the mMMC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Thus, the MC-T and MC-TC are comparable with mMMC and mCTMC, although due to the plasticity of this cell and differences in the proteases between the two species, this is an oversimplification, and caution is advised in drawing too strong an analogy between the murine and human systems. As in the mouse, subsequent studies have identified other tissue-dependent phenotypes, such as an intestinal mast cell containing only chymase and labeled MCc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>] or an esophageal mast cell containing only tryptase and carboxypeptidase A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mucosal mast cells</strong> &ndash; Mucosal mast cells (MMCs) in mice are found in the mucosal epithelial surfaces of the intestine and respiratory tract, typically in association with inflammation associated with Th2 responses. Intestinal infections and allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis and asthma, result in dramatic increases in the numbers of MMCs and to a lesser extent, connective tissue mast cells (CTMCs) at the involved sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As MMCs expand in number, they also differentiate in ways that are defined by the tissue microenvironment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. As an example, in murine <em>Trichinella spiralis</em> infection, the MMC population undergoes sequential changes in the secretory granule phenotype as it migrates through the lamina propria to an intraepithelial residence and then reverses its migration and phenotype with the resolution of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Thus, the phenotype of these cells is dynamic and defined by the inflammatory perturbations at a tissue site, likely allowing this cell to play roles in both the <span class=\"nowrap\">induction/amplification</span> phase and the <span class=\"nowrap\">resolution/healing</span> phase of the response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/65,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The development of MMCs is dependent on T cell-derived factors, such as IL-3 and IL-4, as evidenced by the selective absence of MMCs in athymic mice and studies in cytokine-deficient mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/69-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-72</a>]. Similarly, patients with HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who have low CD4+ T cell counts are profoundly deficient in intestinal mast cells of the MC-T phenotype, illustrating the dependency of this human mast cells' phenotype on T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Connective tissue mast cells</strong> &ndash; Connective tissue mast cells (CTMCs) in mice are found in the submucosal connective tissues of the intestine and throughout the body in association with various other connective tissues.

Also, their numbers do not increase as significantly in acute reactions as the mMMC in the intestine or the lung of mice following Th2-mediated inflammations, such as in helminthic infection or atopic diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In humans, increased numbers of mast cells are noted in association with bronchial smooth muscle in asthmatics and with the synovium in rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/66,73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,73,74</a>].</p><p/><p>As mentioned previously, mast cell populations within tissues can expand severalfold during various disease states, including the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parasitic infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mastocytosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atopic diseases (including urticaria, acute allergic reactions, rhinitis, and asthma)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatologic disease (rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonparasitic infectious disease (tuberculosis and syphilis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neoplastic disease (melanoma and intestinal neoplasms)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic diseases (chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, osteoporosis, and eosinophilic esophagitis)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CELLULAR IDENTIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cells are normally round mononuclear cells, which exhibit phenotypic variation in cytoplasmic morphology.

Poorly granulated mast cells (eg, immature progenitors) or mast cells that have recently degranulated if stained with Giemsa or toluidine blue will stain poorly, making them difficult to pick out in tissue sections and can cause them to be mistaken for monocytes.

This property of staining purple upon application of a blue dye is referred to as metachromatic staining and is due to the presence of highly sulfated, anionic proteoglycans (eg, heparin) complexed with the various secretory granule proteases. Metachromatic staining is unique to mast cells and basophils.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Eosinophils are usually easily differentiated from mast cells.
