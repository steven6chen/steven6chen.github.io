Due to these interventions, there has been a 75 percent decrease in the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer over the past 50 years in developed countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>Eighty-four percent of cervical cancer cases were from less developed regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In women in developing countries, cervical cancer was the second most common type of cancer (15.7 per 100,000 women) and the third most common cause of cancer mortality (8.3 per 100,000). On the continent of Africa and in Central America, cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>In developed countries in 2012, cervical cancer was the eleventh most common type of cancer in women (9.9 per 100,000 women) and the ninth most common cause of cancer mortality (3.3 per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

A higher magnitude of difference in cervical cancer mortality between black and white women was found in a United States national survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The study excluded women who reported a prior hysterectomy (thereby changing the denominator and making the cervical cancer mortality rates higher overall) and found the following mortality rates: black women (10.1 per 100,000) and white women (4.7 per 100,000). The study raises the question of whether there is a higher than previously calculated risk of cervical cancer mortality when only vulnerable women are included (women with a cervix). A limitation of the study is that hysterectomy history was self-reported, and there was no differentiation made between total and supracervical hysterectomy.</p><p>In the era of HPV vaccination, most experts expect a decrease in the incidence of cervical cancer in women who receive the vaccine. By some estimates, if vaccine rates of 70 percent worldwide are achieved, we would expect to see a decrease of 344,520 new cases of cervical cancer annually and avoid 178,182 cervical cancer-related deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, due to the latency period of 10 to 15 years between HPV exposure and cervical cancer development, there are not likely to be significant decreases in cervical dysplasia or cancer for many years after the implementation of vaccination programs. Surprisingly, in countries such as Australia that have achieved vaccination rates &gt;70 percent, there has already been a 38 percent reduction in high grade dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Even in countries with lower vaccination rates, such as the United States, for example, there has been a decrease in the incidence of high grade cervical dysplasia. As an example, in Connecticut between 2008 and 2011, the vaccination rate increased from 45 to 61 percent. During that same time period, there was a decrease in high grade cervical dysplasia of 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As high grade dysplasia is a necessary precursor for squamous, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous carcinomas of the cervix, this sharp decrease in high grade cervical dysplasia should translate into decreased incidence of cervical cancer in the next decade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7674822\"><span class=\"h2\">Age distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worldwide in 2012, the cumulative risks of developing cervical cancer and of cervical cancer mortality by age 74 years were: developed countries (0.9 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">incidence/0</span>.3 percent mortality) and developing countries (1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/0</span>.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The lifetime risk of developing cervical cancer for United States women, based upon national data from 2000 to 2004, was 0.76 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The mean age at diagnosis of cervical cancer in the United States from 2000 to 2004 was 48 years. Only 5.7 percent of cases were diagnosed in women age 85 years or older. From 2000 to 2004, the United States age-adjusted incidence of cervical cancer in girls under age 20 was 0.1 per 100,000, rising to 1.5 per 100,000 in women age 20 to 24 years, and then ranging from 11.0 to 15.8 per 100,000 for women age 30 to over 85 years. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7674829\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two major histologic types of cervical cancer, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and the preinvasive disease that corresponds with these histologies share many of the same risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-23</a>].

In the same study, use of oral contraceptives for 10 years from age 20 to 30 years was estimated to increase the cumulative incidence of invasive cervical cancer by age 50 from 7.3 to 8.3 per 1000 in developing countries and from 3.8 to 4.5 per 1000 in developed countries. A systematic review that included 12 studies of women with cervical cancer found that in those who were known to be HPV positive, increased duration of oral contraceptive use was associated with an increase in the rate of cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].
