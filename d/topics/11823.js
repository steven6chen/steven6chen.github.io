They are broadly categorized as urothelial and non-urothelial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of bladder neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features and treatment of non-urothelial bladder cancers will be reviewed here. Small cell carcinoma of the bladder is discussed elsewhere, as is an overview of urothelial bladder cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small cell carcinoma of the bladder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-approach-and-management-of-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial approach and management of urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8186522\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-urothelial bladder cancer accounts for less than 5 percent of all bladder tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 90 percent of non-urothelial bladder cancers are epithelial in origin, and these include squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. </p><p>Non-epithelial tumors include sarcoma, carcinosarcoma, paraganglioma, melanoma, and lymphoma. Risk factors for non-urothelial bladder cancers are discussed below in specific sections for different tumor types. (See <a href=\"#H99843805\" class=\"local\">'Non-epithelial bladder tumors'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of non-urothelial bladder cancers is incompletely understood. Both the development of metaplasia and the presence of chronic infection are believed to be important factors in tumorigenesis. Alternative hypotheses include the development of non-urothelial bladder cancers from preexisting urothelial (transitional cell) carcinomas that undergo metaplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and tumor development from multipotent stem cells in the bladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8186565\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue metaplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue metaplasia develops in response to chronic infection and inflammation, which can lead to the development of either squamous epithelium and leukoplakia or mucinous and glandular epithelium. However, the factors that lead to neoplastic transformation are not known.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squamous cell carcinoma is often associated with squamous metaplasia and is seen in 16 to 28 percent of patients with leukoplakia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two patterns of metaplasia have been associated with adenocarcinoma. Cystitis cystica refers to the invagination of hyperplastic epithelial buds into the lamina propria, which may undergo further metaplasia to cystitis glandularis and is associated with vesical adenocarcinoma. A second pattern involves hyperplasia of the epithelial buds but does not involve invagination into the lamina propria.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8186571\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic urinary tract infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs) are associated with both non-schistosomal and schistosomal bladder cancers. Infection may contribute to the development of bladder cancer through multiple mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Predisposing patients to metaplasia, the initial step in carcinogenesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis produce nitrosamines, whose metabolites are highly carcinogenic. Carcinogenesis results from DNA adduct formation and possibly from other mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Production of reactive oxygen species by inflammatory cells responding to infection, leading to DNA damage and activation of other carcinogens.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8186558\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like urothelial carcinomas, patients with non-urothelial bladder cancer typically present with painless hematuria (grossly visible or microscopic), although irritative voiding symptoms (frequency, urgency, dysuria) can be the initial manifestation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Less common presentations more commonly observed with non-urothelial bladder cancers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucusuria &ndash; Mucusuria has been described with bladder adenocarcinomas and is more common with urachal adenocarcinomas compared with the non-urachal adenocarcinomas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal mass &ndash; The presence of an abdominal mass is more commonly associated with urachal adenocarcinoma compared with non-urachal adenocarcinomas. (See <a href=\"#H8187622\" class=\"local\">'Adenocarcinoma'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8186658\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected bladder neoplasm, and cystoscopic biopsy generally provides tissue for a definitive diagnosis. Compared with urothelial cancers, non-urothelial tumors are more likely to be muscle invasive at diagnosis and more likely to be upstaged when definitive pathological staging from surgery is available. Hence, as a group, non-urothelial tumors present at a later stage, contributing to a poorer prognosis compared with urothelial cancers; however, one interesting observation is that urachal cancers tend to have a better prognosis than urothelial cancers of a similar stage at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8186705\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the rarity and heterogeneity of non-urothelial bladder tumors, the approach to the treatment of these tumors is largely based upon retrospective series and small trials. Therefore, treatment is usually extrapolated from the approach to patients with urothelial bladder cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-approach-and-management-of-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial approach and management of urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients who present with localized disease, the primary treatment is cystectomy. For patients with squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or schistosomal bladder cancer (regardless of histology), this should include a lymph node dissection along with radical cystectomy. </p><p>Because these tumors appear to be less responsive to chemotherapy compared with urothelial carcinoma and because these tumors were not included in phase III trials, we do not recommend pre- or postoperative chemotherapy for non-urothelial cancers of the bladders, ureter, or renal pelvis. </p><p>Pre-cystectomy radiation therapy (RT) may have a role in schistosomal bladder cancer, but it is not part of the standard treatment approach for other bladder tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. There are no high-quality data to inform the role of chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RT as adjuvant treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-cystectomy-and-bladder-sparing-treatments-for-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical cystectomy and bladder-sparing treatments for urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with advanced non-urothelial bladder cancer who are not candidates for surgery, including those with metastatic disease, treatment options include palliative care, RT, or chemotherapy. Whenever possible, such patients should participate in clinical trials. Given that trials for specific groups of non-urothelial cancers are uncommon, these patients are generally candidates for early phase clinical trials and &quot;basket studies&quot; that permit enrolment of tumors with specific mutations that are considered &quot;actionable&quot; by the drug being offered in the trial. Case reports suggest that non-urothelial cancers can respond to targeted agents detected by molecular profiling techniques, such as next-generation sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Where possible, patients whose tumors contain potentially actionable mutations should be accrued to clinical trials that prospectively capture molecular, response, and outcome data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>In general, these patients should be referred for palliative care, as their prognosis is poor and the benefits of treatment are not clear. Decisions should take into account the lack of prospective data to inform the benefits of treatment in light of the risks associated with therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-metastatic-urothelial-cancer-of-the-bladder-and-urinary-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer of the bladder and urinary tract&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8187546\"><span class=\"h1\">SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371863486\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for 3 to 5 percent of bladder cancers in North America and Europe and up to 75 percent of bladder cancers in areas where <em>Schistosoma haematobium </em>infection is endemic. (See <a href=\"#H8187727\" class=\"local\">'Schistosomal bladder cancer'</a> below.) </p><p>In addition to schistosomal infection, reported risk factors associated with the development of squamous cell carcinoma include chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), bladder calculi, pelvic radiation therapy (RT), antecedent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravesical-bacillus-calmette-guerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin</a> (BCG) treatment, and prolonged exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, particularly when complicated by hemorrhagic cystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The risk of squamous cell carcinoma has also been linked to smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p>Chronic indwelling catheters also have been associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in some studies, although the association is controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;, section on 'Urinary complications'</a>.)</p><p>Two, large, population-based studies in patients with spinal cord injury did not identify an increased risk of bladder cancer, although the design of these studies and the frequency of squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma in such patients may have precluded a statistically significant outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, the bladder cancers that were identified in patients with neurogenic bladders had increased incidences of muscle invasion, and the investigators favored intermittent catheterization rather than an indwelling catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Although periodic screening cystoscopies have been recommended for spinal cord injury patients by some investigators, no studies have demonstrated a benefit from screening, perhaps because of the extremely low incidence of cancer in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-and-preventive-strategies#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of urinary bladder catheters and preventive strategies&quot;, section on 'General complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1057458033\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary treatment for squamous cell carcinoma is surgical. Preoperative RT is reasonable, particularly when the likelihood of complete resection is in doubt due to suspected locally advanced disease. </p><p>Support for the role of surgery comes from observational and retrospective data. As an example, a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database analysis of 1422 patients diagnosed between 1988 and 2003 found that the two-year all-cause mortality following cystectomy ranged from 11 percent in men with stage I disease to 72 percent in men with stage IV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. After adjusting for age, sex, race, and initial therapy, squamous cell carcinoma histology was associated with poorer outcomes compared with urothelial bladder cancer. </p><p>The strong tendency of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder to recur locally following radical cystectomy provides a rationale for preoperative RT with or without concomitant radiosensitizing chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the quality of the available data is limited due to the small number of patients included, biases in patient selection, and the heterogeneity of treatments administered.</p><p>Preoperative RT is preferred over postoperative treatment in such cases, due to the risk of bowel toxicity and because it is harder to determine an appropriate RT treatment field after the bladder has been removed. Although a number of retrospective case series have suggested possible benefit for adjuvant or neoadjuvant RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. There has been only one prospective trial, which was conducted in the context of schistosomiasis infection, and the results may not be applicable to non-schistosomal squamous cell carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H8187727\" class=\"local\">'Schistosomal bladder cancer'</a> below.) </p><p>For patients with locally advanced, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, radiation with concomitant radiosensitizing chemotherapy (as done for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and uterine cervix) represents a reasonable approach, especially since these tumors tend to be locally aggressive. However, there are little prospective data to guide management.</p><p>Data from the phase III BC2001 trial show efficacy for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C given concurrently with RT compared with RT alone in patients with high-grade muscle invasive bladder cancer, with improved local and locoregional control and a trend toward better survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In this trial, only 2.7 percent of patients had adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, with no difference found in outcomes compared with urothelial cancer. A very similar regimen is effective and well tolerated in patients with squamous cell cancer of the anus, so extrapolation to the setting of squamous cell cancer of the bladder may be reasonable, especially in patients who are poor candidates for platinum-containing chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. </p><p>Limited data suggest that squamous cell carcinoma is relatively resistant to the chemotherapy regimens used for metastatic urothelial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In light of these findings, we prefer that these patients participate in a prospective clinical trial. Encouraging results with T cell checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atezolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atezolizumab</a> for advanced urothelial cancer previously treated with a platinum-based regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] and results with immunotherapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and head and neck cancer provide a rationale for enrolling patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder in clinical trials, so we continue to seek such trials for these patients. </p><p>In the absence of a clinical trial, regimens used to treat metastatic urothelial cancer can be tried. We prefer the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> based on phase II trial data where six patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder were treated with good outcomes, similar to the urothelial cancer patients in the same trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The experience in this trial has been reproducible in our clinical practice for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.

Glandular, colloid, papillary, signet-ring, and clear-cell types have all been described. The signet-ring variant appears to be associated with a poorer prognosis than other forms of adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

However, they more commonly relapse locally rather than distantly in contradistinction to urothelial carcinomas. In one study, postoperative radiation therapy (RT) was associated with longer relapse-free survival and a much lower local relapse rate, but the distant relapse rate increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-bladder-neoplasms#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of bladder neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Adenocarcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>Two categories of adenocarcinoma have been described: urachal and non-urachal carcinoma; each has a distinct natural history that can help guide treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8187698\"><span class=\"h2\">Urachal adenocarcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urachus is formed early in embryonic life. In two-thirds of individuals, the urachus coalesces with the umbilical arteries to form the umbilical ligament and is obliterated by birth. Urachal adenocarcinoma arises in the urachal remnant and is characterized by its location at the dome of the bladder, usually extending into the prevesical space. A diagnosis of urachal adenocarcinoma is supported by the presence of a patent urachus, an absence of metaplasia (cystitis glandularis), and either no involvement or only secondary involvement of the urothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>Urachal adenocarcinomas are mucin producing in 90 percent of cases.

Urachal adenocarcinoma usually presents with locally advanced disease. Hematuria is common, and patients with urachal adenocarcinoma frequently present with a palpable lower abdominal mass, in contrast to those with other bladder cancers.</p><p>A retrospective review identified 420 patients with malignant urachal neoplasms in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

A retrospective series of 21 patients, including 14 with adenocarcinoma, had a response rate of 36 percent to first-line cisplatin-containing regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>We had previously used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> as a standard in adenocarcinoma of the bladder for many years.

A summary is provided below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bladder sarcoma </strong>&ndash; Bladder sarcoma is a malignant mesenchymal tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The diagnosis is most frequently made between the ages of 50 and 60, with a slight male predominance. One-half of bladder sarcomas are leiomyosarcomas, and approximately 20 percent are rhabdomyosarcomas. Risk factors include a history of local irradiation, prior <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> treatment, and schistosomiasis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The prognosis depends upon the patient's age and the extent, rather than the type, of tumor. Five-year overall survival ranged from 60 to 80 percent in small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>]. The management of these patients is similar to the approach to patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

A review of one center's experience with 15 carcinosarcomas and 26 sarcomatoid carcinomas found that the two exhibited similar clinical pictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Both were more common in older adults and male patients, and were diagnosed at an advanced stage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paraganglioma</strong> &ndash; Paraganglioma account for less than 0.05 percent of non-urothelial bladder cancers and 10 percent of extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas; approximately 15 percent are malignant. Bladder paragangliomas demonstrate a slight female predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Paragangliomas are thought to arise from embryonic nests of chromaffin cells in the sympathetic plexus of the detrusor muscle. Release of catecholamines can be triggered by voiding, bladder distention, defecation, or sexual intercourse. Typical symptoms include diaphoresis, paroxysmal hypertension, palpitations, headaches, and syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. If a bladder paraganglioma is suspected, cystoscopy should be accompanied by adrenergic blockade. Biopsy should be avoided since these tumors are vascular and are often covered by intact urothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

It is more common in women (3:1 ratio women to men) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Around 80 percent are mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT; marginal zone) lymphomas. MALT tumors are thought to result from chronic inflammation; in one series, two-thirds of patients had chronic cystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. The disease is usually localized at diagnosis and most often adequately treated with transurethral resection, antibiotic therapy directed at <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>, and cystoscopic surveillance. The remaining 20 percent of cases are most often diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) or other more-aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma variants, where standard treatment consists of chemotherapy or radiation as used for lymphomas occurring at other sites. The prognosis is excellent, with attributed mortality from cases of primary bladder lymphoma being less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature. It is usually muscle invasive at the time of diagnosis but appears to have a better prognosis than other primary bladder cancers. The small number of patients identified precludes definitive treatment recommendations, but long-term survival has been reported after transurethral resection, partial cystectomy, or radical cystectomy, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy or RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metastatic disease </strong>&ndash; The most common cancers to metastasize to the bladder are melanoma and lymphoma.

Non-urothelial bladder cancers are further classified as epithelial or non-epithelial. Approximately 90 percent of these cancers are epithelial in origin, including squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and small cell (neuroendocrine) tumors. Non-epithelial cancers are rare and include sarcomas, carcinosarcoma, paraganglioma, melanomas, and lymphomas. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of non-urothelial bladder cancers is incompletely understood. Both the development of metaplasia and the presence of chronic infection and inflammation are believed to be important factors in tumorigenesis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Like urothelial carcinomas, non-urothelial bladder cancers commonly present with hematuria and bladder irritation. Mucusuria has been described with bladder adenocarcinomas and is more common with urachal types than non-urachal adenocarcinoma. The presence of an abdominal mass may also point to the diagnosis of urachal adenocarcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H8186558\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection with <em>Schistosoma haematobium</em> is associated with squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma of the bladder. In areas where such infections are endemic, non-urothelial bladder cancers comprise up to 80 percent of bladder cancer cases. (See <a href=\"#H8187727\" class=\"local\">'Schistosomal bladder cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with non-metastatic, non-urothelial bladder carcinoma, we recommend surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). There is no defined role for adjuvant treatment in these patients, but certain patients may benefit from neoadjuvant radiation therapy.

However, a trial of chemotherapy is reasonable for patients with a good performance status who are otherwise candidates for chemotherapy. Decisions on treatment should take into account the lack of prospective data to inform the benefits of treatment in light of the risks associated with therapy.
