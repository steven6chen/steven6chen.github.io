Before birth, babies lie in the uterus in different positions. They can lie with their head, shoulders, legs, or buttocks closest to the vagina. Doctors call it &quot;breech&quot; when a baby's feet or buttocks are closest to the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72643\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72643 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Early in pregnancy, it is common for babies to be in a breech position. Toward the end of pregnancy, most babies lie with their head closest to the vagina. Doctors call this &quot;vertex presentation&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 2</a>). The head-down position is the safest position for a baby to be in for a vaginal delivery. But in some cases, the baby is still in the breech position toward the end of pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H581002145\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes a breech pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most breech pregnancies happen by chance. But some breech pregnancies happen because of a problem with the baby, the mother's uterus or placenta, or the amount of amniotic fluid around the baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H581002160\"><span class=\"h1\">Does a breech pregnancy cause symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. Women might feel discomfort under their rib cage, where the baby's head presses. Women might also feel their baby kicking in their lower belly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H581002175\"><span class=\"h1\">How will my doctor or midwife know if I have a breech pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>He or she will do an exam to check your baby's position. This involves pressing on your belly to feel the position of your baby's head. In the last 3 months of pregnancy, your doctor, nurse, or midwife will check your baby's position at each visit.</p><p>You might also have a test called an ultrasound to check your baby's position. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of your baby in your uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H581002190\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my baby is breech?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most breech babies turn head down (by themselves) before labor.</p><p>If your baby is still in a breech position near your due date, your doctor or midwife might recommend trying to turn your baby around to a head-down position. To do this, your doctor or midwife will press on your belly and try to move your baby. If this works, and your baby moves to a head-down position, you can go into labor and try to have a vaginal delivery. If it doesn't work and your baby stays in the breech position, your doctor or midwife will likely recommend that you have a c-section (surgery) to deliver your baby (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87130 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>In some cases, babies who are breech are delivered vaginally. This is called a vaginal breech delivery. But during this type of delivery, problems involving the baby or mother are more likely to happen. Because of this, vaginal breech deliveries are not usually done.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H581002222\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am having twins?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are having twins, your doctor or midwife will check the position of each twin. If the first twin is in a breech position, your doctor or midwife will probably recommend that you have a c-section to deliver your babies. If the first twin is head down and the second twin is breech, your doctor or midwife will discuss your choices with you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H581002112\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labor-and-delivery-childbirth-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Labor and delivery (childbirth) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=having-twins-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Having twins (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prenatal care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
