These ectopic endometrial implants are usually located in the pelvis, but can occur nearly anywhere in the body. The disease can be associated with many distressing and debilitating symptoms, or it may be asymptomatic. Despite numerous studies, considerable controversy remains regarding the incidence, pathogenesis, natural history, and optimal treatment of this disorder.</p><p>This topic will discuss endometriosis specifically in adolescents. The disease in adults is reviewed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Management of ovarian endometriomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-long-term-treatment-with-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-agonists\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Long-term treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of infertility in women with endometriosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-surgery-for-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive surgery for female infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnostic-approach-and-treatment-of-adults-with-thoracic-endometriosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnostic approach, and treatment of adults with thoracic endometriosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of endometriosis in the general population is not known; estimates vary depending upon the population studied (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and the method of diagnosis (clinical versus surgical). The disease has been reported in 25 to 38 percent of adolescents with chronic pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] and 47 percent of those with chronic pelvic pain that undergo laparoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The prevalence among adolescents undergoing laparoscopy for pelvic pain not controlled with oral contraceptive pills (OCs) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is 50 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two-thirds of adult women with endometriosis report that their symptoms started before age 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although it had been assumed that endometriosis presented only after many years of menstruation, this was incorrect: symptomatic cases have been documented prior to menarche in girls who have some breast development, and others soon after menarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Some adolescents may have a genetic predisposition to developing endometriosis. In one study of 123 patients with histologically proved endometriosis, first degree female relatives of affected patients were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with endometriosis than relatives of controls (7 versus 1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many theories have been proposed to explain the etiology of endometriosis. No single theory explains all cases, and all of the theories help to explain some aspects of the disease. The types and frequencies of pathogenetic mechanisms may be different in adolescents and <span class=\"nowrap\">postpubertal/premenarchal</span> endometriosis than in adult endometriosis. It is likely that the cause of endometriosis is multifactorial, with contributions from several of the proposed mechanisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The following theories for the pathogenesis of endometriosis have been proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The implantation or retrograde menstruation theory suggests that endometrial tissue from the uterus is shed during menstruation and transported through the fallopian tubes, thereby gaining access to, and implanting on, pelvic structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This theory is supported by the observation that endometriosis occurs most commonly in the dependent portion of the pelvis. In addition, obstructive congenital anomalies of the female genital tract that enhance retrograde flow have been associated with endometriosis in the adolescent population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,14</a>]. As an example, one series identified six adolescents with m&uuml;llerian anomalies and endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The youngest patient was a 12-year-old with vaginal atresia and bicornuate uterus who developed hematocolpos, likely followed by retrograde flow leading to her endometriosis. Repair of this type of obstructive anomaly has been associated with resolution of endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], but in our experience, this has not been true in all cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometriosis in locations outside the pelvis is explained by dissemination of endometrial cells or tissue through lymphatics and blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The coelomic metaplasia theory proposes that the coelomic (peritoneal) cavity contains undifferentiated cells or cells capable of dedifferentiating into endometrial tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This theory is based upon embryologic studies demonstrating that all pelvic organs, including the endometrium, are derived from cells lining the coelomic cavity. Support for this theory derives from the observation of endometriosis in premenarchal girls who have some breast development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/8,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The direct transplantation theory is the probable explanation for endometriosis that develops in episiotomy, hysterotomy, and other surgical scars.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cellular immunity theory, which is the most recently proposed hypothesis, suggests that a deficiency in cellular immunity allows ectopic endometrial tissue to proliferate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appreciation of the clinical manifestations of endometriosis in the adolescent may decrease the length of time between patient presentation and clinical diagnosis, which averages nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Ideally, early diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis will retard disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and decrease the adverse long-term effects of the disease (chronic pain, endometriomas, infertility), and thus improve the quality of life of adolescents and women with this disorder.</p><p>Adolescents with endometriosis usually have both acyclic and cyclic pain (severe, progressive dysmenorrhea) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72066\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72066 \">table 1</a>); isolated cyclic pain is the least common pain presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Bowel symptoms (eg, rectal pain, constipation, painful defecation that may be cyclic, rectal bleeding) and bladder symptoms (eg, dysuria, urgency, hematuria) are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], while ovarian endometriomas and infertility are rare in adolescents.</p><p>In contrast, adults with endometriosis commonly have cyclic pain, and present with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, a pelvic mass, infertility, or chronic pelvic pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2622939357\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Patient presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of pelvic pain in adolescents include pregnancy (intrauterine or ectopic), appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, m&uuml;llerian abnormalities with outflow obstruction, hernia, bowel disease, and psychosocial issues. The etiology and evaluation of chronic pain in this population are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Questions that should be addressed by the history are listed in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76235\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76235 \">table 2</a>). Having the patient keep a diary documenting the frequency and character of her pain will help determine whether the pain is cyclic, and if it is related to bowel or bladder function. Patients with a history of sexual or physical abuse may be at increased risk of developing chronic pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], but this should not preclude further evaluation for endometriosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of the physical examination is to determine the etiology of the pain and to rule out an ovarian tumor or anomaly of the reproductive tract. The approach to abdominopelvic examination depends on the patient. Although important, it may not be possible to perform a complete pelvic examination in all adolescents. For adolescents who are not sexually active, rectal-abdominal examination may be better tolerated than vaginal-abdominal (ie, bimanual) examination; a bimanual pelvic examination is not a requirement for evaluation of adolescent pelvic pain. A Q-tip can be inserted into the vagina to document patency and exclude obstructive or partially obstructive anomalies such as a transverse vaginal septum, imperforate or microperforate hymen, vaginal agenesis, or an obstructed hemivagina. Anomalies are present in about 5 percent of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The abdominal examination is usually normal. On pelvic examination, adolescents rarely have uterosacral nodularity, a common finding in adults with the disease, but pain in the cul-de-sac is common. Adnexal enlargement may be palpable if an endometrioma is present, but these masses are also rare in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Sonographic examination should be performed to augment a limited physical examination and <span class=\"nowrap\">identify/exclude</span> causes of abdominopelvic pain other than endometriosis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Nongynecologic physical findings that are observed more frequently among women with endometriosis are red hair color, scoliosis, and dysplastic nevi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory tests to consider include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which may suggest the presence of an acute or chronic inflammatory process</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis and urine culture to identify pain originating in the urinary tract (eg, cystitis, stone)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy test and tests for sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhea, chlamydia), when appropriate</p><p/><p>CA 125 is most commonly used as a biomarker for ovarian cancer, but can be elevated in other conditions, including endometriosis. A serum CA 125 level is not a useful screening test due to its high rate of false positives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81621 \">table 3</a>). It has been used occasionally to follow the progress of disease in patients who have histologically or visually confirmed endometriosis at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], but we prefer to rely on the patient's report of symptoms to follow endometriosis, and do not use CA 125 in clinical management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adult women with endometriosis, sonography can identify an endometrioma, which is one of the presentations of the disease. Imaging is less useful in diagnosis of endometriosis in adolescents since endometriomas rarely occur and typical lesions of adolescent endometriosis cannot be appreciated with ultrasound. However, ultrasound may be useful to <span class=\"nowrap\">identify/exclude</span> several structural causes of pelvic pain in adolescents, such as ovarian torsion or hemorrhage, tumors, genital tract anomalies, and appendicitis. (Refer to individual topic reviews).</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful to better define an abnormality suspected by sonography, but should not be used as a first-line imaging test because of its expense and poor sensitivity for detecting peritoneal lesions or staging endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Computed tomography is also an insensitive test in the diagnostic evaluation of endometriosis, unless an endometrioma is identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Management of ovarian endometriomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TRIAL OF MEDICAL THERAPY FOR DYSMENORRHEA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">NSAIDs and hormonal therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical treatment of dysmenorrhea is appropriate prior to considering surgical intervention for <span class=\"nowrap\">diagnosis/treatment</span> of endometriosis in adolescents with dysmenorrhea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who have difficulty participating in normal activities, are missing school, or avoiding extracurricular activities because of pelvic pain. A three-month trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) is a reasonable approach when the pain evaluation suggests a nonacute gynecological source, such as primary dysmenorrhea or endometriosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71912 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The medication should be started before the expected onset of severe pain, if possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary dysmenorrhea in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hormonal therapy, such as a cyclic low-dose combination <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progestin</span> oral contraceptive pill (OC), or progestin only therapy (oral, injectable, or implantable), should be given with the NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There are no data suggesting one contraceptive pill formulation is better than another for the treatment of dysmenorrhea. Use of hormonal therapy leads to decidualization and subsequent atrophy of ectopic and eutopic endometrial tissue, thereby decreasing bleeding and, in turn, reducing bleeding-related pain. These agents are particularly useful in adolescents also needing contraception. The vaginal ring and transdermal contraceptive patch are other examples of methods of combined hormonal contraception and are acceptable alternatives to OCs. All of these methods are safe and effective if given cyclically or in an extended or continuous cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. The extended cycle regimen has been successful in women whose pain did not respond to cyclic therapy, but is associated with more unscheduled bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;, section on 'Estrogen-progestin contraceptives'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal contraception for suppression of menstruation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraception-issues-specific-to-adolescents#H1458454894\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraception: Issues specific to adolescents&quot;, section on 'Pill, patch, or ring'</a>.)</p><p>If the pain does not resolve with NSAIDs and hormonal therapy, then further evaluation is necessary to determine whether endometriosis is the etiology of the pain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For adult women in whom endometriosis is the suspected cause of the pain, an expert panel opined that a trial of medical therapy with a GnRH agonist is justified provided that there are no other indications for surgery (eg, suspicious adnexal mass) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The empiric utilization of a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist allows patients with chronic pelvic pain and a high probability of endometriosis to avoid a diagnostic surgical procedure before beginning this therapy. Doses are described below (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'GnRH agonists'</a> below).</p><p>Placebo controlled randomized trials have confirmed the efficacy of this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The only randomized trial that directly compared use of a GnRH agonist (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=goserelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">goserelin</a>) to low-dose cyclic OCs in adult women with pelvic pain associated with endometriosis showed that both drugs provided significant relief of pain, but goserelin was superior for treatment of dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>We do not utilize empiric GnRH agonists for adolescents 18 years of age or younger because we have concerns about potential adverse long-term effects on bone formation and bone mineral density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Additionally, some parents are not comfortable with a trial of empiric therapy due to worries about using a medication with adverse side effects without a definitive diagnosis. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not endorse the use of empiric GnRH agonist therapy for treatment of presumed endometriosis in young women under age 18, but considers it an option for consenting women age 18 or over [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis of endometriosis.</p><p>When pain persists despite dysmenorrhea therapy, we talk with the adolescent and her family to determine the amount of pain that she is experiencing. We suggest that if her pain interferes with her daily life's activities or places her at a disadvantage in academics, sports, or social activities compared with others, then she should undergo laparoscopy for definitive diagnosis. Typically, laparoscopy is performed after three to six months of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], but waiting this long may interfere with school and social activities. Therefore, it may be necessary to proceed with laparoscopic evaluation sooner. At surgery, up to 70 percent of adolescents with chronic pelvic pain that has not responded to a trial of NSAIDs and cyclic OCs are found to have endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These data are from studies in the early 1990s.

A diagnostic laparoscopy with subsequent referral to a specialist for definitive surgery places the patient at undue risk from two anesthesias. Therefore, the surgical procedure should be both diagnostic and therapeutic, with surgical management of the endometriosis.</p><p>It is especially important to achieve a good cosmetic result in adolescents. To minimize visible scarring, the laparoscope trocar can be placed through a vertical incision directly in the umbilicus. Additional operative ports should be placed symmetrically 1 to 2 cm above the pubic symphysis so that the pubic hair will grow over the incision site(s).</p><p>The gynecologist operating on an adolescent with pelvic pain must be familiar with the appearance of endometriosis implants in this age group. The implants have variable morphology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65789\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65789 \">picture 1</a>), which has been described in the revised American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) Classification of Endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The only series that objectively compared endometriosis lesions in adolescents to those in adults found red flame lesions were more common and powder burn lesions less common in adolescents than in adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This is consistent with the presumption that powder burn lesions represent older, more advanced implants. Clear and red lesions may be the more painful lesions of endometriosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65934\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65934 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Peritoneal windows or defects are also common in adolescents and should be recognized as diagnostic of endometriosis.</p><p>Care must be taken to identify subtle endometriotic lesions that often appear as clear, shiny peritoneal vesicles. Visualization through a liquid medium, such as saline, may facilitate identification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. After all the lesions have been located, the fluid is removed so that the lesions can be ablated or excised.</p><p>If no evidence of endometriosis is identified, a posterior cul-de-sac biopsy to exclude the presence of microscopic disease should be performed and may identify lesions not visualized on laparoscopy.

We use the three-month formulation to improve compliance with therapy. Some patients who receive a one-month formulation experience the expected &ldquo;flare effect&rdquo; (increased pain and bleeding) and then do not return for their second one-month injection.

An algorithm for evaluation and management of adolescents with chronic pelvic pain is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55370\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55370 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic endometriosis occurs in adolescents, in rare cases before menarche. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents with endometriosis usually have both acyclic and cyclic pain. Bowel symptoms (eg, rectal pain, constipation, painful defecation that may be cyclic, rectal bleeding) and bladder symptoms (eg, dysuria, urgency, hematuria) are also common, but uterosacral nodularity and ovarian endometriomas are rare. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For evaluation of pelvic pain in adolescents, we suggest history and physical examination, pain diary, laboratory evaluation (eg, pregnancy test, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urinalysis, urine culture, testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia), and ultrasonography to exclude other anatomic causes. However, a bimanual pelvic examination should not be considered a requirement for evaluation of adolescent pelvic pain. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the pain evaluation suggests a nonacute gynecological source, we suggest medical treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">dysmenorrhea/endometriosis</span> rather than laparoscopy for diagnosis and therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and cyclic hormonal therapy for first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Trial of medical therapy for dysmenorrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not respond to medical therapy within three months should undergo laparoscopy to make a definitive diagnosis and undergo <span class=\"nowrap\">ablation/resection</span> of lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adhesions. Fifty to 70 percent of adolescents with chronic pelvic pain have endometriosis diagnosed at the time of laparoscopy. A gynecologist familiar with the appearance and treatment of endometriosis in adolescents should perform the surgical laparoscopic procedure. The laparoscopic appearance of endometriosis may be subtle, with red flame lesions and clear shiny peritoneal vesicles rather than powder burns. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Patients who fail therapy for dysmenorrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For medical management of confirmed endometriosis in adolescents &le;16 years of age, we suggest continuous hormonal therapy with either a combination <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progestin</span> or progestin therapy alone for first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (with add-back therapy) are a second-line approach. For adolescents &gt;16 years of age, we suggest either continuous combined hormonal contraception or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists with add-back therapy as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative medical treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upon completion of GnRH agonist with add-back therapy for six to nine months, the patient begins a continuous combined hormonal contraceptive. If she is not able to tolerate continuous combination hormonal therapy, then we suggest long-term utilization of a GnRH agonist with add-back (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'GnRH agonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We have treated patients with surgically diagnosed disease refractory to other medications with prolonged GnRH agonist treatment plus add-back for over 10 years. A baseline bone density evaluation should be obtained prior to starting retreatment with a GnRH agonist or if therapy is to be continued for over six months. If the patient remains on GnRH agonist with add-back therapy, a bone density test should be obtained every two years. Pain that does not respond to aggressive medical therapy may be due to recurrent endometriosis, endometriomas, pelvic adhesions from endometriosis or prior surgery, or a new and different disease process. A repeat laparoscopic procedure should be considered for diagnosis and therapy in this clinical situation. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Management of recurrent pain'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-in-adolescents-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Vercellini P, Fedele L, Arcaini L, et al.
