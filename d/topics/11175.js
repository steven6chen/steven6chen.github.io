These disorders may represent variants of MCD or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), but some clinicians and pathologists believe that they are separate conditions.</p><p>The nosology of IgM and C1q nephropathy is particularly unsettled. However, clinicopathologic findings suggest forms of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome that, in terms of prognosis and treatment options, are closer to FSGS than to MCD.</p><p>Idiopathic mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, IgM nephropathy, and C1q nephropathy will be reviewed in this topic. The pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of MCD and FSGS are discussed separately.

This pattern can be seen in a variety of diseases including lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, and mild postinfectious glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, there is a seemingly idiopathic form in which there are either no immune deposits (in contrast to the IgA or IgG deposits in the above disorders) or focal or diffuse IgM-containing deposits in the mesangial areas. Patients with this glomerulopathy tend to present in one of two ways: with hematuria; or, more commonly, with proteinuria that is often in the nephrotic range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Most publications dealing with the latter involve childhood idiopathic nephrotic syndrome with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) on renal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis present with episodes of gross hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] or with microscopic hematuria that may be detected on a routine examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. These findings may follow a nonstreptococcal upper respiratory infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], a pattern that resembles that of IgA nephropathy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>). The hematuria often resolves spontaneously, although persistent microscopic hematuria may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The renal prognosis in these patients is almost always excellent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephrotic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 3 to 5 percent of patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome have mild diffuse mesangial cell proliferation but not FSGS on light microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/2,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,9</a>]. Electron microscopy usually demonstrates relatively diffuse foot process fusion, suggesting that this disorder may be part of the minimal change disease (MCD)-FSGS spectrum. The observations that more than one-half of patients respond initially to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and that nonresponders at eight weeks are often in remission at one year are also consistent with a relation to these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/2,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8-10</a>]. It has been suggested, for example, that mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis is a more severe form of MCD in which the initial injury is greater, leading to mesangial dysfunction and a slower rate of recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The prognosis, however, is not uniformly good. Ten to 30 percent of cases develop progressive renal insufficiency with signs of FSGS on repeat renal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> has been tried in those patients with persistent nephrotic syndrome who are resistant to glucocorticoid treatment, particularly if they have a rising plasma creatinine concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/2,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,12</a>]. One report, for example, treated 18 such patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and cyclophosphamide in full doses for three months with tapering over the next six months: 14 underwent complete remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Nine of these patients relapsed after mean of six years; eight went into remission after a repeat course of therapy. Likewise, as in glucocorticoid-resistant MCD and FSGS, other agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, may be of value. Patients with the nephrotic syndrome and those who have failed or become resistant to glucocorticoids may benefit from alternative immunosuppressive agents. However, there are no reliable controlled studies to direct treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">IGM NEPHROPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis have prominent diffuse mesangial deposits of IgM and complement, along with electron dense deposits in the mesangium, and it has been suggested that this represents a separate disorder that has been called IgM nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/3,7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,13</a>]. Other cases show IgM on immunofluorescence microscopy (often segmental rather than diffuse) but no mesangial deposits on electron microscopy; in this setting, the IgM may be nonspecifically deposited onto an abnormally permeable glomerular basement membrane or trapped in an area of glomerulosclerosis. Some clinicians would prefer to consider those biopsies without electron-dense mesangial deposits as either minimal change disease (MCD) or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) rather than true IgM nephropathy.</p><p>Patients with IgM nephropathy are less likely to respond to immunosuppressive agents than those with MCD. One summary of published studies, for example, revealed an approximately 1:1:1 distribution of patients who are glucocorticoid responsive, glucocorticoid dependent (requiring continuing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> therapy to sustain a partial or complete remission of proteinuria), and glucocorticoid resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Responses may be seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, but relapses and late resistance to therapy are not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A review of 55 children with glucocorticoid-dependent or -resistant MCD identified twenty-three who had IgM deposits by immunofluorescence microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Of these, 61 percent (14 of 23) had microscopic hematuria, 48 percent (11 of 23) were glucocorticoid dependent and 48 percent (11 of 23) were glucocorticoid resistant. Eighteen percent of those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (2 of 11 patients) obtained remission while 55 percent (6 of 11) were resistant to cyclophosphamide. Of those initially treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, 88 percent (7 of 8) obtained complete (4 of 8) or partial (3 of 8) remission. Positive immunofluorescence for IGM may be surrogate marker for the severity of MCD. In addition, these data suggest that children with MCD and IgM-positive immunofluorescence may have a better response to cyclosporine than cyclophosphamide.</p><p>In the largest series to date, the probability of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was approximately 23 percent at 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This was more favorable than that observed in another relatively large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], in which the probability was approximately 20 and 36 percent at 5 and 10 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This difference was most likely related to a lower threshold for biopsy in the first series.</p><p>It remains controversial, however, if IgM nephropathy is a separate disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. Scattered (focal and segmental) IgM deposits can be found with roughly equal incidence in patients with MCD, FSGS, and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These observations have led to the suggestion that the IgM deposits are a secondary event and that the renal prognosis is best predicted by the findings on light microscopy, with those patients with minimal histologic changes having the best response to therapy and long-term outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Others feel a biopsy should not be labeled IgM nephropathy unless there are clear discrete mesangial electron dense deposits on electron microscopy.</p><p>However, the glucocorticoid response rate in IgM nephropathy with MCD appears to be no better than 50 percent, which is well below the over 90 percent response rate in patients with idiopathic MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of minimal change disease in adults&quot;</a>). Thus, the presence of mesangial IgM deposits clearly signifies a worse prognosis, although the pathogenesis of the deposits and the possible relationship to FSGS is unresolved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">C1Q NEPHROPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>C1q nephropathy refers to a disorder in which mesangial proliferation is associated with mesangial deposits on electron microscopy and prominent C1q deposits on immunofluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80250\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80250 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>].</p><p>C1q nephropathy has been thought to be a subgroup of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. However, many reports describe different symptoms, histopathologies, therapeutic responses and prognoses, suggesting that C1q nephropathy may be a combination of several disease groups rather than a single disease entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. C1q nephropathy may be associated with minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), or proliferative glomerulonephritis. Criteria for the illness include predominant C1q deposits on immunofluorescence microscopy and no clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus.</p><p>The following are the results from large single-center series in which the clinical, histologic, and prognostic features of patients with C1q nephropathy were described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/17,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22-26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among nearly 9000 renal biopsies reviewed from 1994 to 2002 from Columbia University in New York, nineteen were classified as C1q nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Seventeen patients had FSGS (six with collapsing and two with cellular forms) on renal biopsy, and two had MCD. At a mean follow-up period of 27 months, 12 of 16 available patients (75 percent) had stable renal function, with 7 of 12 entering partial or complete remission (with or without immunosuppressive therapy).

All patients with FSGS presented with the nephrotic syndrome. Of those with proliferative glomerulonephritis, 75 percent presented with chronic kidney disease.

Of these, 8, 46, and 7also displayed histologic evidence of FSGS, MCD, and proliferative glomerulonephritis, respectively. Three patients with FSGS developed ESRD 8 to 15 years after biopsy. Relapse of nephrotic syndrome was common among those with either MCD or FSGS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A total of 35 children with C1q nephropathy were identified among those who presented with proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome to a pediatric nephrology unit in London between 1991 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Of these, 19 had minimal change, 9 had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 4 had focal global glomerulosclerosis, and 3 had mesangial proliferation by light microscopy. Children with C1q nephropathy and minimal change by histology had similar remission rates at four years compared with minimal change disease controls, despite more frequent relapses. By contrast, most of the children with C1q nephropathy who had other histological appearances (ie, focal segmental or global glomerulosclerosis or mesangial proliferation) were glucocorticoid resistant and did not achieve a complete remission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 2221 children aged 3 to 15 years, 30 had biopsy-proven C1q nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Eighteen were asymptomatic but had hematuria. Twelve had a nephrotic syndrome. In a majority (73 percent), light microscopy revealed MCD, and the remaining had immune-mediated glomerulonephritis or FSGS.

Patients may have isolated hematuria or nephrotic range proteinuria. Whereas the renal prognosis is good for patients with isolated hematuria, it is not as good for those with nephrotic syndrome as 10 to 30 percent may develop progressive renal insufficiency.

Others require the presence of electron dense deposits by electron microscopy as well as the finding of IgM deposition by immunofluorescence microscopy to define IgM nephropathy. The presence of IgM deposits in a patient with MCD signifies a poorer prognosis compared with MCD without deposits as fewer than 50 percent of such patients respond to glucocorticoids.
