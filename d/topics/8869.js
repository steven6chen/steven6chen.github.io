Although uncommon in children, it is important to identify and treat IE because of its significant morbidity and mortality. Prompt diagnosis, rapid treatment, and recognition of complications are imperative for optimal patient outcomes.</p><p>IE is also referred to as bacterial endocarditis because bacteria are the predominant microbial pathogens. IE is used in this review to include both bacterial and fungal endocarditis.</p><p>Many aspects of IE are similar in children and adults, but there are some manifestations that are unique to children. An overview of IE in children is presented here.

Subsequently, rates of IE in children increased during the latter half of the twentieth century due to marked improvements in the survival of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) and increased use of central venous catheters (CVC) in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. </p><p>During the first two decades of the twenty-first century, rates of IE in children appear to have plateaued.

The risk of IE is highest in patients with complex cyanotic heart disease, especially in those who have had surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/9,12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12-18</a>].</p><p>Reported incidence rates of IE in children with CHD range from 40 to 60 per 100, 000 person-years, which is several orders of magnitude higher than in the general pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>]. In these reports, the CHD lesions at highest risk for IE included cyanotic lesions, endocardial cushion defect, left-sided lesions, and ventricular septal defects (VSD). Other risk factors included cardiac surgery within six months and age &lt;3 years.</p><p>There appears to be an increased risk for IE in patients who undergo transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (eg, following repair of tetralogy of Fallot); the risk is particularly high with bovine jugular vein prostheses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This issue is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot#H99136589\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and outcome of tetralogy of Fallot&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary valve replacement and RV function'</a>.)</p><p>In a study of 3840 pediatric hospital admissions for IE from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2000 to 2010), 54 percent had underlying cardiac conditions, including CHD (81 percent), rheumatic heart disease (15 percent), and cardiomyopathy (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most common congenital heart defect was VSD (32 percent). Cyanotic lesions accounted for 25 percent of the CHD cases. A prosthetic valve was present in 7 percent and other cardiac devices were present in 4 percent.</p><p>In a similar study of 1588 pediatric hospital admissions for IE from the Kid's Inpatient Database (2000 to 2003), the most common CHD diagnoses were tetralogy of Fallot (20 percent), ventricular septal defect (18 percent), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (10 percent), congenital aortic regurgitation (8 percent), D-transposition of the great arteries (6 percent), and patent ductus arteriosus (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3567589714\"><span class=\"h3\">Central venous catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An indwelling CVC is another major risk factor for pediatric IE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. At-risk pediatric populations for IE include critically ill and premature infants, and children with cancer or connective tissue disorders. The increased use of CVCs in these pediatric groups appears to be a major factor for IE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/9,12,13,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13,21,22</a>]. The risk is similarly increased with use of other intracardiac devices (eg, ventriculoatrial shunts, pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and prosthetic and bio-prosthetic valves). As use of these devices becomes more common, the relative proportion of device-related IE increases.

In the previously described Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2000 to 2010) study, the relative frequency of different pathogens varied according to whether the child had underlying heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among children <strong>with</strong> underlying heart disease:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>S.</em> <em>aureus</em> &ndash; 28 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other <em>Staphylococcusococcus</em> species &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Virdians streptococci &ndash; 33 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other streptococci &ndash; 17 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gram-negative bacilli &ndash; 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Polymicrobial &ndash; 11 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among children <strong>without</strong> underlying heart disease:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>S. aureus</em> &ndash; 47 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other <em>Staphylococcus</em> species &ndash; 6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Viridans streptococci &ndash; 18 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other streptococci &ndash; 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gram-negative bacilli &ndash; 8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Polymicrobial &ndash; 12 percent</p><p/><p>These results demonstrate the relatively high incidence of endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus, which is an acute fulminant process with a high mortality rate, as compared with IE due to most other pathogens. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> below.)</p><p>Although patients with indwelling catheters are at risk for bacteremia with gram-negative organisms, gram-negative bacterial endocarditis is rare. This is probably due to the poor ability of gram-negative bacteria to adhere to the endocardium. However, in neonates with IE, likely etiologic agents in addition to S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci can include Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter species, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Similar to adults, blood cultures remain negative in 5 to 7 percent of children with IE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/4,6,23,24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,23,24,27</a>]. Potential mechanisms include previous administration of antimicrobial agents, inadequate microbiological techniques, or infection with highly fastidious bacteria or nonbacterial pathogen. Consultation with an infectious disease expert is recommended in all cases of culture-negative endocarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=culture-negative-endocarditis-epidemiology-microbiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Culture-negative endocarditis: Epidemiology, microbiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fungal endocarditis is rare and is typically caused by Candida species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Indwelling catheters and high glucose concentrations in parenteral nutrition have contributed to the occurrence of fungal endocarditis, especially in premature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Fungal endocarditis is frequently associated with large, friable vegetations that can embolize, producing important complications.

It is dependent upon the extent of the local cardiac disease, degree of involvement of other organs (eg, embolization), and the causative agent.</p><p>IE is generally classified as a subacute or acute process.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Subacute</strong> &mdash; The subacute presentation is characterized by a prolonged course of low-grade fever and nonspecific complaints including fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, weight loss, exercise intolerance, and diaphoresis. The presence of a cluster of these symptoms in a patient at risk for IE (ie, those with preexisting heart disease or indwelling central venous catheter) should raise the possibility of IE as a potential diagnosis. In addition, there is a risk of immunologic sequelae, such as immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. The less virulent pathogens, such as viridans group streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci, are usually the causative agents for subacute IE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute</strong> &mdash; Acute IE is a rapidly progressive and fulminant disease. These patients typically have high spiking fevers, and appear severely ill. An acute presentation is commonly seen in patients with IE due to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which can cause rapid destruction of heart valve tissue, abscess formation, embolic phenomena, and a rapidly progressive deterioration in hemodynamic status.</p><p/><p>The clinical findings of IE correspond to the underlying pathologic phenomena of <span class=\"nowrap\">bacteremia/fungemia,</span> valvulitis, immunologic response, and embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms associated with bacteremia or fungemia include fever, and vasodilation and tachycardia due to decreased systemic vascular resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-sepsis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of sepsis&quot;, section on 'Circulation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valvulitis may result in a new or changing murmur. In some patients, tachypnea and hypotension are signs of heart failure, which occurs because of perforation of a valve, chordal rupture, or poor ventricular function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) with either a systemic-pulmonary shunt or conduit procedure, the murmur may not change, but a decline in systemic oxygen saturation may occur due to obstruction of blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glomerulonephritis may develop in children who present with subacute IE as a consequence of immune-mediated disease. Other immunologic sequelae (ie, Roth's spots, Janeway lesions, and Osler nodes) are less common in children than they are in adults. These are described in greater detail elsewhere.

Emboli to the brain may result in neurologic symptoms (eg, seizures, headache, strokes, or altered mental status). Other major organs that may be at risk for embolic episodes include the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, limbs, and lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the neonate, the signs and symptoms of IE are variable and nonspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. They include feeding intolerance, tachycardia, respiratory distress, hypotension, and a new or changing murmur. Fever may not be present with either subacute or acute IE. Those with right-sided IE in association with central venous catheters characteristically have little clinical evidence of disease other than persistently positive blood cultures in the setting of appropriate antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Fungal IE is more common in the newborn infant and may present as an acute fulminant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Although there have been several proposed diagnostic criteria for IE, the one most commonly used in the diagnosis of pediatric IE is the revised Duke criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis#H973176202\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Modified Duke criteria'</a>.)</p><p>According to the revised Duke criteria, IE is diagnosed based upon the presence of one of two pathologic criteria or, more commonly, with certain combinations of clinical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73023 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic criteria &ndash; One of the following two pathologic criteria are required for the diagnosis of IE:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Direct evidence of endocarditis based upon histological findings</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Positive Gram stain results or cultures of specimens obtained from surgery or autopsy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical criteria &ndash; The clinical criteria are divided into major and minor findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53004 \">table 2</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Blood cultures'</a>.)</p><p>A minimum of three blood cultures should be obtained over a time period of a few hours to two days depending upon the severity of the illness. In most patients, three blood cultures are obtained from separate venipunctures in the first 24 hours, and an additional two blood cultures in the next 24 hours if there is no growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infective-endocarditis-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Unless there has been prior antibiotic therapy, more than five blood cultures over two days is generally not warranted. Since bacteremia is generally continuous, the blood cultures do not have to be obtained at any particular time in the fever cycle.</p><p>It is important to obtain adequate volumes of blood for culture. However, in children, it is often not possible to obtain the large volumes of blood (10 to 20 mL) recommended for adults with suspected IE. In most pediatric settings, the obtained volume of blood for culture is about 1 to 3 mL in infants and young children, and 5 to 7 mL in older children.
