While successful treatment of OSA with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy or other modalities typically improves sleep quality, a small proportion of patients continue to experience EDS.</p><p>Patients with residual daytime sleepiness require careful evaluation to ensure proper functioning of positive airway pressure therapy or oral devices, adherence with primary therapy, and exclusion of alternative causes of EDS. In patients with adequately treated OSA and no additional explanations for residual sleepiness, symptomatic treatment with a wakefulness promoting drug may be beneficial.</p><p>The evaluation and management of residual sleepiness in adults with OSA is discussed here. Primary therapy for OSA (eg, PAP, oral appliances, or, occasionally, surgery) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2839784\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is defined as the inability to maintain wakefulness and alertness during the major waking episodes of the day, with sleep occurring unintentionally or at inappropriate times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-residual-sleepiness-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In practice, EDS is often measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), with scores greater than 10 generally considered abnormal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F77101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77101 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-epworth-sleepiness-scale-ess-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). The ESS does not capture all facets of sleepiness, however, and some patients who are sleepy may have a normal ESS score.</p><p>Residual sleepiness in patients with OSA refers to the subjective complaint of EDS that is present even when breathing and oxygenation parameters during sleep are normalized by successful OSA therapy. Although this definition of residual sleepiness is agreed upon, the entity itself is not universally accepted, as some experts feel that the prevalence of EDS in patients with successfully treated OSA simply reflects a prevalent complaint in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-residual-sleepiness-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172524467\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported prevalence of residual sleepiness in patients adequately treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ranges from 6 to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-residual-sleepiness-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for residual sleepiness are not well defined. In at least one large study, baseline severity of OSA was not predictive of residual sleepiness after adequate CPAP therapy; in fact, patients with moderate OSA at baseline (defined as an apnea hypopnea index [AHI] between 15 and 30 events per hour) were two times more likely to complain of residual sleepiness than those with severe OSA (AHI &gt;30 events per hour) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-residual-sleepiness-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the same study, female gender, higher pretreatment Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, and higher pretreatment depression scores were associated with increased risk of residual sleepiness, whereas body mass index (BMI), age, and medical comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes were not.</p><p>The prevalence of residual sleepiness decreases with increasing nightly CPAP use, independent of post-treatment AHI and oxygenation status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-residual-sleepiness-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172524473\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients with OSA is likely multifactorial. Sleep fragmentation caused by repeated episodes of pharyngeal collapse and arousal is thought to be the most important mechanism. Additional factors may include abnormal sleep architecture, activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, and chronic inflammation and cytokine production.</p><p>Experimental studies in animals have suggested that intermittent nocturnal hypoxia may cause irreversible cellular injury in regions of the brain that control sleep wake regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-residual-sleepiness-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>], but it is not known whether this is contributory in humans. The degree of nocturnal hypoxia has been inconsistently associated with measures of daytime sleepiness in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-residual-sleepiness-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/6,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172524480\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since most patients show improvement in daytime sleepiness after successful treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or other airway-specific therapies, the first step is to ensure that the primary therapy is being used regularly.</p><p>Duration of nightly CPAP use has been shown to correlate with improvement on subjective and objective measures of sleepiness above a threshold of about four to five hours of mean nightly use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-residual-sleepiness-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Up to 50 percent of patients with OSA do not use their CPAP every night, and among those patients, mean nightly use is less than four hours per night. Recognition of nonadherence is important because there are a variety of interventions that can help promote CPAP use, including troubleshooting device side effects and behavioral therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients should also be evaluated for alternative causes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Some of the most common causes of EDS aside from OSA include insufficient sleep, medication side effects, and comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders such as depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86811 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness#H1822286\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>If the patient is adhering to primary therapy and no alternative causes of EDS have been identified, repeat in-laboratory polysomnography (with the patient wearing their device) is typically indicated to assess whether the primary OSA therapy (ie, CPAP, oral appliance) is adequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-residual-sleepiness-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Adequate primary therapy is defined as normalization of the apnea hypopnea index (AHI, the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep), inspiratory flow limitations and maintenance of acceptable oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-residual-sleepiness-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Reasons for persistently abnormal parameters include inadequate CPAP titration leading to residual respiratory events, mask or mouth leaks, and treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. Titration and optimization of CPAP therapy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More objective measures of sleepiness such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) or a related study, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), are not routinely used in the evaluation of EDS except when there is a suspicion for narcolepsy or other central disorders of hypersomnolence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness#H9660137\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;, section on 'Multiple sleep latency test'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172524487\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H967287654\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjunctive pharmacotherapy for residual sleepiness in patients with adequately treated OSA is controversial, and the level of daytime sleepiness at which a trial of stimulant therapy is warranted has not been well-defined. The first step is a thorough evaluation to confirm adequate primary therapy and exclude other causes of daytime sleepiness. (See <a href=\"#H172524480\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with OSA who have persistent daytime sleepiness that is burdensome enough to require therapy, have had alternative causes of daytime sleepiness excluded, and have had the efficacy of their conventional therapy confirmed, we suggest a trial of a wakefulness-promoting agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-residual-sleepiness-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>].

Stimulants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> and amphetamines have not been studied in patients with OSA.</p><p>The decision to prescribe a wake-promoting medication is generally based on patient symptoms, rather than a more objective test, such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score is the most commonly used instrument to guide decision making about initiating adjunctive therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F77101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77101 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-epworth-sleepiness-scale-ess-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). Although no single best cut-off value has been determined and treatment decisions should take into account multiple factors, we believe that ESS scores of 10 to 12 or higher are a reasonable threshold for initiating a treatment trial.</p><p>Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the wakefulness-promoting agents <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=armodafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">armodafinil</a> for this indication based on the evidence reviewed below (see <a href=\"#H967287678\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and dose'</a> below), the European Medicines Agency has not, based on a lack of large randomized studies with adequate safety data and the unresolved question of whether or not residual sleepiness is a distinct entity in patients with OSA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H967287665\"><span class=\"h2\">Modafinil and armodafinil</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H967287678\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy and dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Modafinil</a> and the active R-enantiomer, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=armodafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">armodafinil</a>, act on the central nervous system to enhance alertness.
