An important caveat to consider when appraising the evidence is that most trials used the six-minute walk test (6MWT) as the primary outcome.

The underlying SSc should be treated, if indicated. Patients with SSc-PAH should also exercise as tolerated, receive routine vaccinations, be counseled against smoking and pregnancy, and when indicated, be treated with supportive measures including oxygen, diuretic, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> therapy. Most experts typically avoid routine anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PAH-specific therapy, which is targeted at altering pulmonary vascular tone and remodelling, is best administered by clinicians with expertise in the evaluation and management of patients with pulmonary hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary arterial hypertension-directed therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most aspects (including the indications) of PAH-specific therapy for patients with SSc-associated PAH are identical to those for patients with other types of PAH.

However, the outcomes in patients with SSc-associated PAH are not as good as in patients with other types of PAH, with, perhaps, the exception of an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambrisentan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ambrisentan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tadalafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tadalafil</a> combination.
