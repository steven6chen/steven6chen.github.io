Several agents have been described that can broadly be categorized as absorptive (vital) stains, contrast stains, and reactive stains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68885 \">table 1</a>). Absorptive stains (eg, Lugol's solution and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>) diffuse or are preferentially absorbed across specific epithelial cell membranes. Contrast stains (eg, methylene blue) highlight surface topography and mucosal irregularities by permeating mucosal crevices. Reactive stains (eg, Congo red and phenol red) undergo chemical reactions with specific cellular constituents, resulting in a color change. The stains used for chromoendoscopy are transient, unlike the stains used to tattoo lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tattooing and other methods for localizing colonic lesions&quot;, section on 'Tattooing'</a>.)</p><p>Chromoendoscopy has been applied in a variety of clinical settings and throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Interest in chromoendoscopy increased with the development of technologies such as endoscopic mucosal resection and photodynamic therapy that require precise visual tissue characterization. In addition, chromoendoscopy is being used in conjunction with other advances in endoscopic imaging, such as magnification endoscopy, confocal endomicroscopy, and confocal endocytoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnification-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnification endoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Compared with other evolving diagnostic modalities, such as fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence endoscopy, and optical coherence tomography, the equipment needed for chromoendoscopy is widely available. Furthermore, the techniques are simple, quick, inexpensive, and safe. However, the interpretation of the findings is not always straightforward, and, like many endoscopic techniques, the impact of chromoendoscopy on clinical outcomes relative to standard endoscopic and histologic methods has not been established in large controlled trials.</p><p>This topic will review chromoendoscopy, which generally refers to the application of stains or pigments by spraying through a catheter. Endoscopic tattooing (the injection of dye through a needle to mark a site for future identification), optical coherence tomography, narrow band imaging, magnification endoscopy, and autofluorescence endoscopy are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management#H168914014\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;, section on 'Surveillance'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimal equipment is required for chromoendoscopy, and the reagents used are generally widely available. The procedure is carried out using standard endoscopic equipment. In addition, a special spray catheter (such as the Olympus PW-5L) is essential, since it delivers a fine mist to the mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76175\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76175 \">movie 1</a>). The catheters are reusable and last several years, even when used frequently. A new biopsy channel cap is preferable to minimize the amount of stain that leaks out.</p><p>Stains that are used for chromoendoscopy include Lugol's solution, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, toluidine blue, Congo red, phenol red, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a>. In order to choose the appropriate stain, the endoscopist needs to be familiar with the characteristics of the individual stains and the staining features of specific tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68885 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technique for staining is simple and easy to learn. Certain staining techniques require specific tissue preparations, which are described below. Once that has been accomplished, application of the stain is generally straightforward. The endoscope and catheter tip should be directed toward the mucosa using a combination of rotational clockwise-counterclockwise movements, while simultaneously withdrawing the endoscope tip. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> can be administered immediately prior to staining to minimize contractility and thereby facilitate staining.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8675659\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC DYES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Lugol's solution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lugol's solution contains potassium iodine and iodine, which have an affinity for glycogen in non-keratinized squamous epithelium. The stock solution needs to be diluted to 1 to 4 percent (usually 2 to 3 percent strength works best) followed by spraying of 20 to 50 mL through a spray catheter. </p><p>Normal squamous epithelium stains black, dark brown, or green-brown after a few minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71269\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71269 \">picture 1</a>).An abnormal staining pattern (absence of dye uptake) is associated with conditions that result in depletion of glycogen in squamous cells, such as inflammatory change (eg, reflux esophagitis), dysplasia, or early malignancy. Staining with Lugol's solution is particularly helpful in patients at increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma (such as those who abuse alcohol) and in those with head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>]. It is most commonly used in the esophagus for detection of squamous dysplasia and early squamous cell carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71269\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71269 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Because it can help in revealing the extent and delineation of a lesion, it can be used to guide endoscopic mucosal resection of early squamous cell carcinomas. The number and size of Lugol&rsquo;s voiding lesions can predict those at high risk for having a metachronous or second primary carcinoma in patients with squamous cell esophageal and head and neck carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lugol's is also used to differentiate regenerating squamous epithelium from small areas of residual Barrett's mucosa in patients who have undergone mucosal ablation (eg, after photodynamic therapy or multipolar electrocoagulation). The residual areas of Barrett's esophagus will not stain, but the regenerating squamous islands and normal squamous epithelium will appear dark brown or black (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75257\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75257 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7593976\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy of Lugol's staining</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the detection of squamous lesions, staining with Lugol's solution has a sensitivity of 91 to 100 percent and a specificity of 40 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The value of Lugol's staining has been demonstrated in studies looking at the detection and evaluation of esophageal squamous neoplasia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study that included 158 patients at high risk for squamous cell cancer (because of a history of smoking and alcoholism) demonstrated that Lugol's staining improved the evaluation of the extent of lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Twelve of the patients had cancerous lesions detected by endoscopy before Lugol's staining, with one additional patient with cancer being identified after staining. There was a significant difference in the size of the lesions detected before and after staining. The dye-free surfaces (suggestive of malignancy) after staining averaged 11.6 cm<sup>2</sup> compared with the endoscopically measured mucosal involvement before staining of 1.4 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 225 patients, Lugol's staining increased the identification of both moderate and severe dysplasia, but not of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Of 31 patients with moderate dysplasia, 17 (55 percent) were identified only after staining with Lugol's solution. Of the 35 patients with severe dysplasia, eight (23 percent) were identified only after staining. In addition, 88 percent of the high-grade dysplasia and cancerous lesions were larger or more clearly defined after staining.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Safety of Lugol's staining</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lugol's staining may lead to a transient retrosternal discomfort. A controlled trial suggested that the application of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-thiosulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium thiosulfate</a> solution (20 mL of a 5 percent solution) following staining was associated with a significant reduction in discomfort 30 minutes after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with a history of iodine allergy should not undergo Lugol's staining.

Surface mucus must be removed by applying a mucolytic agent to increase the uptake of the dye into epithelial cells. The original technique for staining reported by Japanese endoscopists involved ingestion of a proteolytic enzyme solution (proteinase or Pronase) followed by methylene blue in a capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24</a>]. The Japanese technique was adapted for use in the United States by substituting a 10 percent solution of N-acetylcysteine for Pronase and a 0.5 percent solution of methylene blue for the capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The reagents are sequentially sprayed onto the mucosa using a washing catheter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66043\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66043 \">picture 3</a>). Excess dye is then vigorously washed off with syringes. The endpoint of staining is subjective and is the most difficult part to learn. As a general rule, washing should continue until the staining pattern is stable. The most common mistake is failure to adequately rinse the mucosa following dye application. Positive staining is defined as the presence of blue-stained mucosa that persists despite vigorous water irrigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1997858\"><span class=\"h3\">Staining patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> is taken up by actively absorbing cells, such as small intestine or colonic epithelium, or ectopic intestinal mucosa. It does not stain non-absorptive epithelia. Thus, staining in the small intestine or colon will normally lead to diffuse background absorption of the dye. Abnormal areas, such as inflamed or neoplastic tissue, will not stain. On the other hand, in the case of metaplastic intestinal mucosa, as is seen in Barrett's esophagus, the abnormal absorptive mucosa will appear blue, while the normal background mucosa will not take up the stain.</p><p>In patients with Barrett's esophagus, staining may be focal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60183\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60183 \">picture 4</a>) or diffuse (&gt;75 percent of Barrett's mucosa stains blue) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Most patients with long-segment Barrett's esophagus have diffuse staining because specialized intestinal metaplasia comprises the majority of the columnar mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The pattern of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> staining is important because dysplastic and malignant Barrett's esophagus behave differently from nondysplastic epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Increasing grades of dysplasia are associated with focal areas of decreased stain intensity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased stain heterogeneity (ie, increasing proportion of light blue or pink unstained mucosa compared with dark blue mucosa). This results from the differential absorption of methylene blue dye into dysplastic cells that have varying degrees of goblet cell loss and decreased cytoplasm (the sites where the dye is absorbed). High-grade dysplasia and endoscopically inapparent adenocarcinomas in Barrett's esophagus can be diagnosed by sampling the heterogeneously stained or light <span class=\"nowrap\">blue/unstained</span> epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73339\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73339 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p>Abnormal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> staining can be helpful in delineating dysplastic or malignant areas for endoscopic therapy, such as endoscopic mucosal resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] or photodynamic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The addition of magnification endoscopy to methylene blue staining may aid in the detection of Barrett's esophagus by classifying its histologic features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71929\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71929 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

Multiple reports have been published in final form or as abstracts that have shown discrepant results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/25,26,28,31-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,28,31-44</a>]. The discrepancies appear to be related to the learning curve for this staining technique; investigators with experience and studies with large sample sizes have reported the best results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/25-29,31-34,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29,31-34,45</a>]. Perhaps because of these issues, a meta-analysis of nine studies with heterogeneous study designs, methods, and study populations concluded that methylene blue chromoendoscopy did not significantly increase the yield of detection of specialized intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia compared with random biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The potential to improve the detection of intestinal metaplasia was illustrated in a study of 975 patients with areas in the distal esophagus that were macroscopically conspicuous for Barrett's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chromoendoscopy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. All patients underwent conventional biopsies, after which the distal esophagus was sprayed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>; additional targeted biopsies were obtained based upon the staining pattern. All patients with documented intestinal metaplasia underwent a repeat endoscopy within one year to assess the reproducibility of the method.</p><p>A total of 3900 conventional biopsies without staining and 130 biopsies with staining were obtained. Conventional biopsies were significantly less likely to show intestinal metaplasia compared with dye-directed biopsies (1.4 versus 88 percent). The conventional biopsies diagnosed Barrett's esophagus in 16 patients (1.6 percent), whereas the dye-directed biopsies diagnosed it in 35 patients (3.5 percent), including all of the patients diagnosed with conventional biopsies.

Several agents have been described that can broadly be categorized as absorptive (vital) stains, contrast stains, and reactive stains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68885 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lugol's solution is most commonly used in the esophagus for the detection of high-grade squamous dysplasia and early squamous cell carcinoma and delineating the borders for endoscopic resection or dissection. It is also used to differentiate regenerating squamous epithelium from small areas of residual Barrett's mucosa in patients who have undergone mucosal ablation (eg, after photodynamic therapy or multipolar electrocoagulation). It is our preferred staining method for these indications because it is readily available, easily applied, and clinically useful. It can also be combined with other mucosal enhancement techniques, such as narrow band imaging. We also perform chromoendoscopy with Lugol's solution prior to endoscopic mucosal resection of dysplasia or early squamous cell cancer of the esophagus. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Lugol's solution'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methylene blue</a> may be used with Congo red for the identification of early gastric cancer.

It is the most common form of chromoendoscopy applied in the colon. Indigo carmine may be used alone or with crystal violet for the detection of early colorectal cancers.
