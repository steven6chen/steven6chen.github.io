The heart is divided into 4 sections, called &quot;chambers.&quot; People with an ASD have a hole between the 2 upper chambers called the &quot;atria&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83029\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83029 \">figure 1</a>). Having a large- or medium-sized hole can change how blood flows through the heart. Plus, it can make the heart work harder than it should. This can cause health problems.</p><p>A person who has ASD was born with it. He or she might only have ASD, or have other heart problems, too. Some conditions that run in families cause ASD.</p><p>An ASD causes a heart murmur. This is an extra sound doctors or nurses hear when they listen to the heart with a stethoscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8615608\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of atrial septal defect?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms are different for each person. They depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size of the ASD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where the ASD is</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the person has other heart problems</p><p/><p>Most babies and children with ASDs have no symptoms. In these cases, the ASD is only found when the doctor or nurse hears a heart murmur at a routine checkup.</p><p>Symptoms are uncommon in babies and young children with ASDs, unless the ASD is very large. In these cases, symptoms of heart failure can develop. These might include losing interest in feeding, fast breathing, not growing well, and getting a lot of colds.</p><p>If a large- or medium-sized ASD is not found and treated, it can cause symptoms later in life, usually by age 40. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal heartbeat &ndash; The heart might feel like it is racing or skipping beats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble exercising or doing other physical activities &ndash; A person with an ASD might also get tired easily just from normal daily activities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin that looks blue</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8615623\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a baby has ASD, a doctor or nurse might find it before birth (on an ultrasound done during pregnancy) or soon after birth. But this does not always happen. See the doctor or nurse if your baby:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seems to lose interest in feeding, or gets tired easily with feeds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does not gain weight or grow as quickly as other children</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has fast or heavy breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets a lot of colds or other infections</p><p/><p>If you or your child have an abnormal heartbeat, trouble exercising, or trouble breathing, see a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8615638\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If the doctor or nurse thinks your child might have an ASD, he or she can order the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in the heart. It might show a pattern of abnormal electrical activity that is common in people who have ASD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray &ndash; A chest X-ray might be normal, or show changes to the heart caused by a large ASD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart as it beats. It can show the size of the hole in your child's heart. It can also show exactly where the hole is and if there are other heart problems.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8615653\"><span class=\"h1\">How is atrial septal defect treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a baby or child has a small ASD, doctors might wait to see if the hole closes on its own. If this happens, a child does not need surgery. Small ASDs usually close by the time a child is 2 to 5 years old.</p><p>Medium or large ASDs are less likely to close on their own. But if an ASD does not cause symptoms, doctors usually wait until the child is 2 years old to close it. This is because there is still a small chance the hole will close on its own. Doctors can close it with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called &quot;transcatheter closure&quot; &ndash; In this treatment, a doctor places a thin tube into a blood vessel in an arm or leg. Then, he or she moves the tube through the blood vessel to the heart. When the tube gets to the hole in the heart, the doctor uses the tube to put in a small device that closes the hole.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to patch the hole</p><p/><p>If an ASD causes symptoms, doctors close the hole using either transcatheter closure or surgery and get rid of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8615668\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-murmurs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart murmurs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=patent-foramen-ovale-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Patent foramen ovale (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
