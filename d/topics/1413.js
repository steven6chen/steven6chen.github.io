While emotional distress is natural and expected in individuals experiencing serious illness and confronting the end of their lives, the differentiation between a normal and appropriate reaction to dying versus a more serious psychiatric disorder such as major depression can be clinically challenging.</p><p>This topic reviews assessment and management of depression in patients receiving palliative care for serious illness. The basic principles of palliative care, assessment and management of other symptoms that are prevalent among patients with advanced illness, as well as psychosocial, existential, and spiritual issues in palliative care are discussed separately.

Data on the prevalence of moderate to severe depression in the last six months of life for patients with terminal cancer were provided by a unique observational cohort study of all cancer decedents in Ontario Canada between 2007 and 2009 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59669\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59669 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Clinicians often fail to recognize the extent of a patient's depression until too late in the course of the disease. As an example, in a survey of 1046 consecutive hospice patients, only 10 percent were prescribed antidepressants at some point during hospice care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients prescribed tricyclic antidepressants were nearly always underdosed, and three-fourths of those started on antidepressants died within two weeks. </p><p>Among the many barriers to the recognition and treatment of psychological symptoms in patients with advanced illness are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mistaken belief that all patients facing or contemplating the end of life are &quot;depressed&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician's lack of knowledge and skill at recognizing and treating major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear of upsetting the patient or intruding at an emotionally vulnerable time</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stigma associated with psychiatric diagnoses such as major depression</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apprehension about possible drug-drug interactions with psychotropic agents</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When caring for patients with advanced illness, clinicians themselves may feel a sense of hopelessness that can lead to therapeutic nihilism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Burden of depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychological distress is a major cause of suffering among patients with advanced disease or terminal illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

While depression is twice as common in women as compared to men in the general population, gender is not consistently reported to be a risk factor for depression in cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/33,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Prior history of depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A past history of depression is a risk factor for major depression in cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/5,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Uncontrolled symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of uncontrolled symptoms, particularly pain, is a major risk factor for depression and suicide among patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. Some speculate that depression may result in an amplification of pain, while others suggest that it lessens the ability to tolerate the stress of physical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. Thus, the causal pathway may be bidirectional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Type of illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of depression also depends upon the patient's particular illness. Among cancer patients, those with head and neck and pancreatic cancers are at a particularly high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/33,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,67</a>]. For patients with pancreatic cancer, psychiatric symptoms may precede the physical symptoms of the disease by several months, leading some to propose that tumor-induced changes in the neuroendocrine system may contribute to depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/61,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,67,68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Illness and treatment-related factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain factors associated with the patient's illness or its treatment may be associated with depression. Tumors arising within or metastasizing to the central nervous system can cause depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/15,58,69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,58,69,70</a>]. In the case of pituitary tumors, this may be related to excess cortisol production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>]. Metabolic complications such as hypercalcemia, often associated with breast and lung cancers, can also be associated with depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Depression is common among patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span>. HIV infection increases the risk of depression both through direct damage to subcortical brain areas, and by disease-related chronic stress, social isolation, and intense demoralization.

Existential suffering and deep personal anguish are some of the most distressing experiences that occur in the dying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The relationship between existential distress and depressive syndromes among the terminally ill is not well studied. In one study, existential distress (ie, concerns related to loss of meaning in life) showed a higher correlation with scores on depression scales than did items pertaining to physical symptoms, medical treatment, or social isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p>Patients who have high levels of spiritual well-being tend to be less depressed.

The beneficial aspects of religion related primarily to spiritual well-being rather than to formal religious practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial issues in advanced illness&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of spirituality in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for depression should be carried out in all palliative care patients given the high prevalence of symptoms. For patients with cancer, the American Society of Clinical Oncology has issued recommendations for the assessment and diagnosis of depression, endorsing practice guidelines from the Pan-Canadian Guideline on Screening, Assessment and Care of Psychosocial Distress (Depression, Anxiety) in Adults with Cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The recommendations state that every patient with cancer should be screened for depression when the initial diagnosis of cancer is made and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated, especially with changes in cancer or treatment status (eg, posttreatment, recurrence, or progression), as well as transition to palliative care. We agree with this recommendation.</p><p>The two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F89663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89663 \">table 2</a>) can be used to screen for depression. Patients who screen positive (a single &ldquo;yes&rdquo; response) should be interviewed to diagnose depression; the interview can be facilitated with the PHQ-9 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 3</a>). Additional information about screening for depression is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-depression-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for depression in adults&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Depressed mood, sadness, grief, and anticipatory feelings of loss are all appropriate responses to advanced disease and dying. However, feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, guilt, lack of pleasure, and suicidal ideation (even mild or passive) are among the best indicators of depressive syndromes in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/21,24,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24,91</a>]. Passive suicidal ideation (I'd be better off dead) should be distinguished from active suicidal ideation (I&rsquo;m going to kill myself). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-clinical-features#H1951779\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Major depression'</a>.)</p><p>A summary of some of the contrasting characteristics of normal grief versus depression in terminally-ill patients is provided in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53062\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53062 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>There are two important caveats:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and guilt must be considered in the context of the patient's illness.

Furthermore, patients may feel helpless because of their physical condition, or there may be a sense of guilt if the illness is related to certain behaviors (eg, cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer in alcoholics, lung cancer in smokers). Symptoms that seem out of proportion to the patient's actual situation should prompt concern for major depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is considerable overlap between the neurovegetative or somatic symptoms of major depression (eg, fatigue, insomnia, anorexia, and weight loss) and those associated with any serious illness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its treatment. This has led some to exclude these symptoms from diagnostic criteria for depression in medically ill patients, a subject which is discussed in detail below.

The available tools are summarized in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66861\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66861 \">table 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Criterion-based diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most widely used criteria to diagnose depression in nonterminally ill patients are those outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. If sufficient criteria are not met for the diagnosis of major depression, then patients may be classified as &quot;adjustment disorder&quot; with depressive features, or mood disorder secondary to medical condition.</p><p>Small differences between investigators in the application of symptom severity thresholds (eg, the severity with which symptoms must be expressed before they are considered clinically significant) can result in large differences in prevalence rates for depression in studied populations. Furthermore, as noted previously, because somatic complaints in medically ill patients may also be attributable to the physical effects of the illness or its treatment, their use as diagnostic criteria can also affect the rate of diagnosis of major depression in medically ill patients, particularly when they are used in conjunction with a low-threshold symptom severity approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Because of these issues, several general approaches to the diagnosis of major depression in the medically ill have evolved, which differ in how they deal with somatic symptoms and in the definition of symptom severity. These approaches are outlined in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81607 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The most widely used is the substitutive approach of Endicott [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. The Endicott scale replaces four of the DSM-IV-TR somatic criteria thought most likely attributable to medical illness or its treatment (ie, change of <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/appetite,</span> sleep disturbance, loss of <span class=\"nowrap\">energy/fatigue,</span> difficulty thinking or concentrating) with cognitive substitutes (depressed appearance, social withdrawal, <span class=\"nowrap\">brooding/self-pity/pessimism,</span> and lack of reactivity in situations that would normally be pleasurable) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60631\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60631 \">table 6</a>).</p><p>Although the substitutive approach is used most often for research purposes, most experts agree that for clinical purposes, the use of a modified inclusive set of diagnostic criteria that incorporates both neurovegetative and psychological symptoms of depression, and emphasizes the presence of hopelessness, worthlessness, guilty, and suicidal ideation is most appropriate for the palliative care population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/1,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,94</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Self-report instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Criterion-based diagnostic systems require an in-depth clinical interview. Self-report methods (eg, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>], 21-item Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] or the shorter 13-item scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>], or visual analog scales [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>]) may be used if a direct face to face interview is not feasible. However, these self-report scales are only a crude substitute for a careful diagnostic interview. The efficacy of these tools as a diagnostic aid in the palliative care setting is not as good as a brief interview directly addressing the commonly accepted diagnostic criteria. Situations where they might be useful include providing additional information in difficult cases, quantifying the severity of a depressive syndrome after initial diagnosis, or monitoring changes in depression over time.</p><p>A self-report measure designed to differentiate between preparatory grief and depression in adults (the Terminally Ill Grief or Depression Scale [TIGDS]) has been developed and validated in a small series of 47 adult inpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. The tool is comprised of grief and depression subscales totaling 47 questions, and is described as easy to administer and acceptable to patients. However, the TIGDS has not been tested in other clinical settings, and requires validation in larger samples.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Simple screening instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful diagnostic interview remains the gold standard method for assessment of depression in medically-ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, direct face-to-face interviews are time-consuming, thus limiting their usefulness in palliative-care settings.</p><p>More than 50 questionnaires have been developed to aid the detection of depression or severe distress, but most have been validated in primary care patients. Few have been studied specifically in palliative care settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/102-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">102-104</a>], and most of these are too long for routine use. Assessment of depression in advanced illness requires instruments that are not only valid and reliable, but also minimally burdensome, acceptable to patients, and easy to administer and score. A detailed discussion of depression assessment in cancer patients is provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Simple one or two-question, and other abbreviated assessments appear to be as effective as longer instruments in screening for depression in most (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61549\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61549 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/97,99,105-111\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,99,105-111</a>] but not all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. The single-item screen is adapted from the SADS (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]) depression criteria, and consists simply of asking the question: &quot;Have you been depressed most of the time for the past two weeks?&quot; </p><p>This method appears to be accurate for identifying patients who might qualify for a diagnosis of depression on the basis of a full interview covering all of the criterion symptoms, and thus is a useful screening tool to select patients who need further evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/97-99,102,106,107,113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-99,102,106,107,113,114</a>]. </p><p>The utility of this approach was shown in a study of 200 palliative care in-patients with terminal cancer that compared the performance of four brief screen measures for depression, including the single-item question &quot;Are you depressed?&quot;, a two-item question assessing depressed mood and loss of interest or pleasure in activities, a visual analog scale (VAS) for mood based on the Memorial Pain Assessment Card [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>], and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), short version [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Using a semi-structured diagnostic interview as the gold standard for diagnosis, the single-item interview (using a threshold stringency equivalent to patients feeling depressed &quot;most of the time&quot;) outperformed both the BDI and the VAS. The two-item scale did not identify more depressed patients, and it characterized four patients as being depressed who were classified as not depressed after the full interview.</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of a single-item question as a screen for depression has been shown by others in diverse cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/102,113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,113,114</a>], although conflicting results have been observed in palliative care populations in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/104,112,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,112,115</a>] and in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. This is perhaps not surprising. While some patients may readily verbalize that they are depressed, others, no matter how despairing, may never acknowledge it, or may label it something else (eg, nervousness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>Guidelines for distress management from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggest the use of a VAS (ranging from no distress to extreme distress) as well as patient self-report of depression, sadness, and loss of interest in usual activities (yes or no) as a screen for depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. Both methods are reasonable as screening tools.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major depression in palliative care or terminally-ill patients is treatable although some data suggest that these patients may not be adequately managed. For example, one cross-sectional analysis of patients with cancer with depression (n = 1538) being treated in Scotland found that over 70 percent of those with depression were not receiving potentially effective therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. </p><p>The more favorable side effect profile of newer antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) has facilitated their use in older adults and the medically ill. Because treatment with these agents is relatively benign and well tolerated, clinicians should have a low threshold for initiating therapy. Psychostimulants, in comparison with other antidepressants, have a faster onset of activity and are the preferred initial option for palliative care patients whose life expectancy is less than two to four months or for those in need of urgent treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">General treatment principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in treating depression is to relieve uncontrolled symptoms, particularly pain. Although pain is most often an issue in the setting of cancer, patients who have diseases that are not usually considered painful (eg, cardiac disease) may also experience moderate to severe pain at the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All patients should have a complete medical evaluation to assess possible general medical contributors to depressed mood. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Illness and treatment-related factors'</a> above.)</p><p>If depression persists once pain is controlled, and a potentially reversible general medical cause of depressed mood cannot be identified, specific therapy is warranted. Treatment should be tailored to the individual needs of the patient. In addition to drug therapy, effective psychosocial interventions include individual or group psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (eg, relaxation training and biofeedback), existential therapy, and self-help groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/120-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">120-124</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complementary and alternative therapies for cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no randomized trials that specifically address the benefit of psychotherapy for palliative care patients with depression, and few that address pharmacologic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. As a result, therapy for depression in these patients is generally based upon the larger body of evidence on effective treatments in patients with cancer, or primary care populations with either no physical illness or less severe medical conditions. Although there is a lack of controlled trials to support the efficacy of combined therapy, most experts recommend an approach that combines supportive psychotherapy with patient and family education and judicious use of antidepressant medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Optimally, this relationship will be one of mutual trust, respect, and sensitivity. Maintaining ongoing contact with the patient both ensures that symptoms and treatment efficacy will be continuously reevaluated, and reassures the patient that he or she will not be abandoned throughout the course of the terminal illness.</p><p>Supportive psychotherapy aims to support adaptive coping mechanisms, minimize maladaptive ones, and decrease adverse psychological reactions such as fear, shame, self-loathing, and withdrawal. The main components of psychotherapy are active listening, supportive verbal interventions, and occasional interpretation.</p><p>Clinicians should elicit from the patient his or her concerns about death and the dying process, but need not focus solely on the issue of death. Patients should be encouraged to talk about their lives and experiences, fears about the impact of illness on family members, and past experiences of coping with loss. Patients should be encouraged to freely talk about or ask questions about their prognosis, with their therapist taking an interested and interactive role in the discussion. Reassurance is useful when it is based on a specific understanding of the individual's status and is not clinically unrealistic.</p><p>Supportive therapy can be provided by the primary medical caregiver, psychiatrist, psychologist, hospice nurse, or social worker, depending on time, interest, training, and the severity of the patient's condition. Sometimes, supportive psychotherapy alone is sufficient to treat depression. Treating major depression with supportive psychotherapy is discussed in more detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-supportive-psychotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Supportive psychotherapy&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Structured cognitive therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive-behavioral techniques, which focus on distorted thoughts that adversely affect mood, are often integrated into depression therapy. These approaches explore patients' beliefs about the cancer diagnosis and its treatment and attempt to elicit irrational or unhelpful thoughts that lead to feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Therapy then leads to the correction of these maladaptive thoughts along with providing new coping skills (eg, relaxation).

Although there is no evidence that any particular antidepressant or class of antidepressants is preferable for patients receiving end of life or palliative care, the 2008 clinical practice guidelines for initial treatment of depression in primary care patients from the American College of Physicians make a strong recommendation to initiate an SSRI, SNRI, or atypical antidepressant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].

Individuals who suffer from depression are at high risk of suicide and suicidal ideation, and have an increased desire for a hastened death. Failure to diagnose and treat depression impairs the quality of life of dying patients, and adds to their burden of suffering. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Scope of the problem'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening and diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for depression should be carried out in all palliative care patients. Screening is conducted when the initial diagnosis of cancer is made and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated, especially with changes in cancer or treatment status (eg, posttreatment, recurrence, or progression), as well as transition to palliative care. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Assessment and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed mood, sadness, grief, and anticipatory feelings of loss are appropriate responses in patients with a serious life threatening illness. Feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, guilt, and suicidal ideation (even mild or passive) are among the best indicators of depressive disorders in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Assessment and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A careful diagnostic interview is the gold standard method for assessing whether patients are clinically depressed. However, a simple single-question (&quot;Have you been depressed most of the time for the past two weeks?&quot;) and other abbreviated screening methods appear to be as effective as longer instruments in identifying those patients who require further assessment for depression. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Tools for assessment and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major depression in terminally-ill patients is treatable. The first step in treating depression is to relieve uncontrolled symptoms, particularly pain. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'General treatment principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive psychotherapy can be provided by the primary medical caregiver, psychiatrist, psychologist, hospice nurse, or social worker. While supportive therapy may be sufficient to treat depression, most experts recommend an approach that combines supportive psychotherapy with patient and family education and judicious use of antidepressant medication. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial interventions'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should have a low threshold to initiate pharmacologic treatment, even if the diagnosis of a depressive syndrome is in question, because both psychostimulants and newer drugs such as selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs) are relatively safe, effective, and well tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For moderately to severely depressed patients who have an estimated life expectancy of at least two to four months, we recommend both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For patients whose life expectancy is at least two to four months, we typically initiate therapy with an antidepressant and choose a selective serotonin receptor inhibitor rather than a tricyclic antidepressant because of their wider safety margin. Patients with more acute depressive symptoms may also benefit from use of a psychostimulant. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Drug selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a shorter life expectancy (less than two to four months), or who need urgent treatment, we suggest a psychostimulant rather than other drugs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients who have an estimated life expectancy of longer than two to four months, an SSRI is then started, and the dose gradually titrated upwards, while the dose of the psychostimulant is gradually reduced. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Drug selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regardless of the initial agent chosen, the starting dose should be approximately one-half that used in non-terminally ill patients, and then slowly and carefully titrated. During this time, maintaining ongoing contact with the patient both ensures that symptoms and treatment efficacy will be continuously reevaluated, and reassures the patient that he or she will not be abandoned throughout the course of the terminal illness. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Supportive psychotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the indications for referral to a psychiatrist are the following (see <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Indications for psychiatric referral'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Uncertainty as to the psychiatric diagnosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of a major psychiatric disorder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients is suicidal or requesting assisted suicide or euthanasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patient is psychotic (hallucinations, delusions) or delirious</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patient is unresponsive to therapy with first-line antidepressants</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Breitbart W, Bruera E, Chochinov H, Lynch M.
