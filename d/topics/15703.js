Given the variability of the clinical presentation associated with concussion, it is important that team physicians and other clinicians responsible for the care of athletes perform a systematic and comprehensive sideline evaluation of each athlete with a suspected concussion. &#160;</p><p>This topic reviews the risk factors, clinical presentation, sideline evaluation, and initial management of adolescent and adult athletes with a concussion.

The biomechanical forces involved in the trauma (eg, acceleration, deceleration, rotation) can injure the brain via a direct blow to the head, face, or neck, or via a blow to the body that transmits force to the head (eg, whiplash). The ensuing brain disturbance is due to neurometabolic dysfunction, which manifests in a wide variety of symptoms and signs that may or may not include loss of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. No gross structural abnormalities are seen with conventional neuroimaging. </p><p>It is important to note that while a concussion typically manifests with rapid onset of short-lived neurologic dysfunction, in some cases, development of signs and symptoms of concussion can be delayed minutes to hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Detailed discussions of the definitions, pathophysiology, and epidemiology of concussion are provided separately.

At this point, there is no compelling evidence supporting one specific test, tool, biomarker, imaging study, or protocol to definitively diagnose or exclude a concussion. In the absence of such evidence, use of a consensus-derived, multimodal concussion assessment tool, such as the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5<sup>th</sup> Edition (<a href=\"http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/early/2017/04/26/bjsports-2017-097506SCAT5.full.pdf&amp;token=DQJtagqB1eRmJhzNMBrECIFyyPwWFwUo/buGt4fs48wVMJ5iuqEvN2t5Ebn72N00zwcdXOyMXx3yt1qFOfydnBrIl2jFpaDgVGLM7WnNQU5CLgZ9zwju1nP4qvlnThxV&amp;TOPIC_ID=85893\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">SCAT5</a>), is recommended as the framework for a sideline concussion evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>As part of the acute sideline evaluation, we recommend gathering all available information about the athlete and their injury, including: mechanism of injury, immediate clinical presentation, concussion risk factors, and initial treatment rendered (if any). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27406945\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential risk factors for increased susceptibility to concussion include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous concussion &ndash; According to prospective studies involving thousands of athletes, a history of concussion substantially increases the risk of recurrence and prolonged recovery from subsequent injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Patients with unresolved symptoms from a prior injury appear to be at greatest risk; recurrent injury is most likely to occur within the first 10 days after the initial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/4,8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger age &ndash; The developing brain may be more susceptible to concussion. According to several small observational studies, younger athletes take longer to recover from a concussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Although data is limited, the general view among experts is that the increased risk of concussion among younger athletes has more to do with their stage of development than their age, with athletes who have yet to complete puberty being at higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher risk sports &ndash;<em> </em>Collision sports, such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, and boys' and men's lacrosse, have the highest concussion rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/6,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19-22</a>]. However, participants in girls' and women's soccer sustain among the highest number of concussions (due in part to the large number of participants), and cheerleading has the highest incidence of catastrophic injury (more catastrophic injuries result from cheerleading than all other female sports combined) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gender &ndash; Evidence suggests that females sustain more concussions than their male counterparts when playing the same sport under similar rules. This is true in soccer, basketball, lacrosse, and hockey. The reasons for this discrepancy remain unclear but may be due to physiological predisposition (neck strength, hormonal differences), style of play or coaching, or females reporting symptoms more readily than males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/20,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24-27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some experts believe that the conditions listed below may increase risk by &quot;lowering the threshold&quot; for concussion.

However, we believe the mechanism is an important piece of information when a reliable history or a video of the injury can be obtained. With the proliferation of video technology in smartphones and other devices, video review of the mechanism of injury has become more widely available for sideline evaluation and subsequent assessment at all levels of sports. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3561423369\"><span class=\"h3\">Location and magnitude of impact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data collected to determine whether there is a correlation between the location and force of impact and a diagnosis of concussion are primarily from studies involving head impact sensors. Although individual studies of athletes using such sensors have concluded that higher forces from both linear acceleration (particularly greater than 100 G) and rotational acceleration (greater than 5500 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/second)</span> are associated with an increased incidence of concussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>], a 2017 systematic review found that the available studies have not established a clinically significant relationship between impact location or impact magnitude and resultant concussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Overall, head impact sensors have not been shown to provide useful information for sideline clinicians and are not recommended as a component of the sideline evaluation. &#160;</p><p>Studies of video review in acute sideline evaluation for concussion show promise, but are limited and of low quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/3,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,37</a>]. The practice of video review and screening for signs of concussion is used in some professional and high level contact and collision sports, such as American football, hockey, and rugby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27406994\"><span class=\"h3\">High risk mechanisms</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double hit &ndash; Although high quality evidence is lacking, in the authors' experience a &quot;double-hit&quot; impact often leads to more severe injury. An example of such an impact might involve an ice hockey player who is checked by an opponent whose shoulder strike's the player's head (first hit), followed immediately by a fall in which the checked player's head strikes the ice (second hit).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma with rotational forces &ndash; Shearing forces from a rotational blow to the head are associated with an increased likelihood of concussion, and often more severe dysfunction with prolonged recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. An example would be an American football player spun forcefully to the turf causing the occiput to strike the ground as it is moving in an arc.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second hit &ndash; A previous blow to the head sustained either earlier the same day (injured early in the first period and again late in the game) or in the days or weeks prior appears to lower the threshold for a more severe concussion. The initial injury may have gone unreported or undetected. This &quot;second blow&quot; phenomenon is distinct from Second Impact Syndrome, a rare but often fatal neurologic injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3194477714\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate clinical response after trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most concussions do not present with frank neurologic signs such as loss of consciousness, posturing, gross disequilibrium, or clear disorientation. However, when these findings are present, the athlete has very likely suffered a concussion and warrants thorough evaluation for concussion or more severe neurologic injury (eg, intracranial bleed, cervical spine injury). (See <a href=\"#H27407053\" class=\"local\">'Indications for emergency department evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27407025\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms of concussion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most concussions are diagnosed based on symptoms. Any new neurologic symptom that develops following sports-related head trauma, whether direct or indirect, strongly suggests the diagnosis of concussion. As examples, a soccer player who heads a ball or an American football receiver or rugby winger that is hit by an opponent with a shoulder to the mid-section and then reports dizziness or feeling &quot;slow&quot; has a concussion. If the same players were to report a new headache only, they should be removed from competition and formally evaluated for a possible concussion. When in doubt, the clinician performing a sideline assessment of an athlete with a new onset headache should treat this as a concussion until further evaluation confirms a different cause. Symptoms associated with concussion are described in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Symptom review is best done in a systematic, comprehensive manner using standardized questionnaires and checklists, such as those found in <a href=\"http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/early/2017/04/26/bjsports-2017-097506SCAT5.full.pdf&amp;token=DQJtagqB1eRmJhzNMBrECIFyyPwWFwUo/buGt4fs48wVMJ5iuqEvN2t5Ebn72N00zwcdXOyMXx3yt1qFOfydnBrIl2jFpaDgVGLM7WnNQU5CLgZ9zwju1nP4qvlnThxV&amp;TOPIC_ID=85893\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">SCAT5</a>.

Most instruments use the Likert scale and many group symptoms into clusters. Commonly used sideline instruments are described below. (See <a href=\"#H8087873\" class=\"local\">'Assessment instruments'</a> below.)</p><p>We find that organizing related symptoms into clusters makes both initial evaluation and surveillance easier to perform. The following are commonly used clusters of concussion symptoms used for evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical &ndash; Headache, nausea, vomiting, balance problems, incoordination, dizziness, visual problems, fatigue, photophobia, phonophobia, <span class=\"nowrap\">numbness/tingling,</span> neck pain. An on-field complaint of dizziness by the athlete is among the best predictors of concussion with a protracted recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive &ndash; Feeling mentally foggy or slow, disorientation, difficulty concentrating, difficulty remembering, slow or incoherent speech, word-finding difficulty, slowed reaction time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotional &ndash; Irritability, sadness, emotional lability, nervousness, behavioral changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-related &ndash; Drowsiness, somnolence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27407036\"><span class=\"h1\">PERFORMANCE OF THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important elements of the physical examination for assessing concussion are described below. Note that cognitive assessment alone is insufficient for evaluating a patient with a possible concussion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Observation</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Look closely for signs of disequilibrium and lack of coordination. During the evaluation, be aware of concerning abnormalities such as inattentiveness, confusion, atypical emotionality (eg, crying or laughter that is inappropriate or out of character for the athlete), or problems following instructions or focusing on a task.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Memory and attentiveness</strong> &ndash; After the initial symptom review, assess memory and attentiveness. Deficits in recall and concentration are common with a concussion. This assessment is best done using a brief standardized neuropsychological test. We recommend <a href=\"http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/early/2017/04/26/bjsports-2017-097506SCAT5.full.pdf&amp;token=DQJtagqB1eRmJhzNMBrECIFyyPwWFwUo/buGt4fs48wVMJ5iuqEvN2t5Ebn72N00zwcdXOyMXx3yt1qFOfydnBrIl2jFpaDgVGLM7WnNQU5CLgZ9zwju1nP4qvlnThxV&amp;TOPIC_ID=85893\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">SCAT5</a>. SCAT5 incorporates the Maddocks questions and Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), which have each been shown to be effective and reliable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77142\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77142 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8087873\" class=\"local\">'Assessment instruments'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Simple orientation questions (eg, person, place, time) alone have <strong>not</strong> been shown to be as helpful in acute sideline assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Observational studies suggest that amnesia, particularly anterograde amnesia, predicts more severe injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic examination</strong> &ndash; Look closely for focal deficits (eg, weakness of an extremity, speech difficulty), which may signify more serious intracranial pathology. Be certain to include the following elements:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Cranial nerve testing</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Strength and sensation testing</strong> of upper and lower extremities. For strength and motor assessment, we test the following: shoulder abduction; elbow flexion and extension; wrist flexion and extension; finger adduction and abduction; hip flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction; knee flexion and extension; and, ankle plantar and dorsi-flexion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Vestibular and ocular motor assessment</strong> &ndash; Assessment of the patient's vestibular and ocular motor function can elicit symptoms that may not otherwise manifest. Symptoms (eg, dizziness, nausea) and findings (eg, exophoria during testing of convergence or accommodation) may not be provoked until the ocular motor system fatigues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In the authors' experience, an athlete with impaired vestibular or ocular motor function typically performs progressively worse with increased neurocognitive stress, and often becomes symptomatic. In other words, vestibular and ocular motor function in a concussed athlete is often worse at the end of an evaluation than the beginning. This is not true in athletes without a concussion. We take this into account in the order of our assessment, which is as follows: cognitive assessment (memory and attentiveness), cranial nerve and motor-sensory function, vestibular and oculomotor assessment (20 seconds each of ocular pursuits (H test), horizontal and vertical saccades, horizontal and vertical gaze stability, visual motor sensitivity, and three trials each of accommodation and convergence evaluation), and balance assessment. A video demonstrating how to perform the vestibular and ocular motor portions of the examination is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F95144\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef95144 \">movie 1</a>). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Balance assessment</strong> &ndash; This is a key component of the sideline evaluation for concussion. Balance deficits are common with occipital brain injury (eg, athlete strikes the back of their head on the ground, contrecoup injury involving the occipital lobe) and with rotational injuries, and can often be observed with simple testing<em>.</em> The best studied evaluation is the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), which is reliable and valid for detecting more pronounced balance problems, but less reliable with subtle deficits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F88702\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88702 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In our experience, balance abnormalities are often not initially appreciated by the athlete, but become readily apparent with a simple assessment (eg, BESS) and are helpful for convincing the athlete that they have a concussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. If initial concussion evaluation is normal and the athlete is asymptomatic, proceed with an exertional trial to determine whether physical exertion provokes any symptoms. The goals are to increase the athlete's heart rate with brief aerobic and resistance exercise and then immediately stress the vestibular system. One simple approach is to have the athlete perform 20 push-ups, run two to three short sprints, perform 15 jumping jacks, and then run a few &quot;figure-eights&quot; (short sprint in a path shaped like the number eight). After this exertional trial, ask the athlete if he or she developed any symptoms (a full symptom checklist is not required for this test).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Of note, acute concussion is often a dynamic and evolving injury, and therefore serial examinations may be warranted to assess for delayed signs or symptoms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Performance of the neurologic examination is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8088201\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It may not be possible to make a definitive diagnosis of concussion on the sideline. However, a preliminary diagnosis can generally be made on the basis of the history (including mechanism of injury), symptoms, and examination findings. If a concussion is suspected, the athlete should be removed from further practice or play, or any other activities with a risk of head trauma. (See <a href=\"#H8087700\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History and mechanism of injury &ndash; An athlete sustains a concussion via trauma to their head either from a direct blow or through forces transferred to their head from trauma to another part of the body (eg, whiplash). (See <a href=\"#H27406972\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although head trauma often immediately precedes symptom onset, sometimes precipitating trauma occurs many minutes or even hours before an athlete appreciates symptoms or manifests neurologic abnormalities (eg, athlete sustains an unwitnessed blow early during a game but presents with symptoms at half-time).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs &ndash; Any athlete who manifests loss of consciousness, confusion, disorientation, disequilibrium, or abnormal speech immediately following head trauma or during the sideline evaluation has at the very least sustained a concussion. In some athletes, the diagnosis of concussion is clear because they experience an obvious transient loss of consciousness witnessed by other players or present during the initial examination. In others, it may be unclear whether a loss of consciousness occurred. However, loss of consciousness is <strong>not</strong> required for the diagnosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms &ndash; Any new neurologic symptom following direct or indirect head trauma establishes the working sideline diagnosis of concussion. Symptoms of concussion should be assessed using a structured symptom review, such as that included in the <a href=\"http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/early/2017/04/26/bjsports-2017-097506SCAT5.full.pdf&amp;token=DQJtagqB1eRmJhzNMBrECIFyyPwWFwUo/buGt4fs48wVMJ5iuqEvN2t5Ebn72N00zwcdXOyMXx3yt1qFOfydnBrIl2jFpaDgVGLM7WnNQU5CLgZ9zwju1nP4qvlnThxV&amp;TOPIC_ID=85893\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">SCAT5</a> assessment checklist. (See <a href=\"#H27407025\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms of concussion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination &ndash; The physical examination of an athlete with a possible concussion should include assessments of memory, attentiveness, cognition, and a neurologic evaluation, including assessments of balance, vestibular function, and oculomotor function. Abnormalities in any of these areas elicited via examination confirm the diagnosis of concussion. (See <a href=\"#H27407036\" class=\"local\">'Performance of the physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>It is important to understand that concussion, unlike many sports-related injuries, is a diagnosis that must be excluded through a negative review of current symptoms and normal examination. In other words, any athlete being evaluated on the sideline for a suspected concussion must prove to the evaluator that they do <strong>not</strong> have a concussion. They do so through the absence of symptoms and a normal examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27407053\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to send an athlete to the emergency department (ED) for more sophisticated testing is based upon the likelihood of significant injury other than concussion (eg, cervical spine injury, intracranial hemorrhage, skull fracture) and the need for neuroimaging and possible intervention. If such injuries are not suspected based upon a careful clinical evaluation, ED referral for concussion management is not cost-effective and may be harmful (cognitive stimuli such as those experienced in the ED may slow recovery and unnecessary neuroimaging with associated radiation exposure may be performed).

Such mimics include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine &ndash; Concussion can be difficult to differentiate from migraine, for which exertion can be a trigger. Key points of distinction include: the athlete is a known migraineur, the headache presentation is typical of previous migraines, and no trauma occurred prior to the onset of the headache. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-concussion headache &ndash; Headaches are common in athletes and many are not due to concussion. <strong>A headache from an acute concussion is triggered by trauma</strong>. The absence of trauma is crucial in distinguishing concussion headache from non-concussion headache.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another distinguishing factor is that the non-concussion headache precedes participation (eg, an athlete without a recent concussion develops a nontraumatic headache before the game and this headache continues during the game). In addition, the characteristics of the headache may be helpful. Typically, a concussion-related headache is relatively diffuse, while headaches from an abrasion or contusion to the scalp are localized and superficial, and associated with focal tenderness. Helmeted athletes, particularly American football players, commonly note frontal or occipital headaches during the early part of the season as they adjust to their helmets. These headaches are not induced by trauma and resolve once the helmet is removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the distinguishing characteristics described here may be helpful, differentiating a concussion-related headache from a non-concussion headache can be difficult and may require a thorough evaluation. If the clinician is unsure, it is best to assume that a concussion has occurred and to keep the athlete out of harm's way: &quot;when in doubt, sit them out.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety &ndash; Acute anxiety can trigger a variety of physical and mental manifestations (eg, nausea, vomiting, confusion, irrational behavior). Clinicians can generally distinguish between symptoms attributable to anxiety and those caused by a concussion on the basis of the history. A concussion is preceded by direct or indirect head trauma. Conversely, symptoms can only be attributed to anxiety <strong>in the absence of head trauma</strong> and when the athlete provides history (current or past) that suggests anxiety as a possible cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panic-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H191515165\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H448541448\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heat illness &ndash; Sideline clinicians must be vigilant for signs of exertional heat illness, particularly life-threatening exertional heat stroke. The presence of high ambient temperature and humidity, risk factors for heat illness (eg, obesity, deconditioning, stimulant use), progressing symptoms, and elevated core body temperature (rectal temperature), and the absence of preceding trauma, usually enable the clinician to distinguish heat illness from concussion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exertional-heat-illness-in-adolescents-and-adults-epidemiology-thermoregulation-risk-factors-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exertional heat illness in adolescents and adults: Epidemiology, thermoregulation, risk factors, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exertional sickle cell crisis &ndash; The presentation of this condition can be similar to exertional heat illness (confusion, lethargy, mental status changes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Knowledge of the patient's history, the absence of trauma, and the presence of risk factors for sickling (eg, deconditioning, activity at high altitude, concomitant febrile illness, dehydration) increase the likelihood of exertional sickle crisis in an athlete with sickle cell trait. Of note, the overwhelming majority of sickle cell trait-associated deaths in collegiate athletics occur during non-contact, off-season training.

It is important to ascertain any history of previous concussion including any protracted or complicated recovery. Knowledge of any recent concussion (within the previous several weeks) is particularly important because the presence of unresolved symptoms increases susceptibility for recurrent, and often worse, injury. The sideline evaluation should be systematic and comprehensive, and typically requires 10 minutes or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/1,29,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29,56</a>].</p><p>To the degree that conditions allow, evaluation should be performed in a quiet environment free off distractions. As examples, at hockey or basketball games, we bring athletes to the locker or training room for evaluation; at American football or soccer matches, we bring athletes behind the stands, into the entry tunnel, or to the locker or training room.</p><p>We perform our assessment as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History &#8210; If the trauma was not directly observed, obtain a description of the trauma from the patient and other observers (eg, athletic trainer, coach, teammates).

Did the athlete appear dazed? Was their speech slow or incoherent? Did they have difficulty following directions or completing assignments on the field? Were they holding their head, or complaining of anything while on the field?

Accordingly, we recommend asking the athlete about any onset of symptoms periodically over the course of the contest (typically every 30 minutes or so) and then after the game. If suspicion for a concussion persists but the results of the initial evaluation are unclear, we suggest resting the athlete and repeating the evaluation between 30 to 60 minutes after the initial assessment. If the clinician remains suspicious about a potential concussion, it is best to remove the athlete from competition regardless of any test results (&quot;when in doubt, sit them out&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8087873\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potentially concussed athlete is best evaluated using instruments designed explicitly for the assessment of a sports-related concussion, thereby ensuring a systematic assessment amenable to field or court-side conditions. Such instruments should include an appropriate review of current symptoms and a focused physical examination, including tests of neurologic function. In addition, it is essential to include post-exertion testing in order to unmask symptoms that may not be present at rest. Post-exertion testing is described above. (See <a href=\"#H27407036\" class=\"local\">'Performance of the physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p>Several instruments for sideline evaluation are available. There is no compelling evidence supporting one specific test, tool, biomarker, imaging study, or protocol to definitively diagnoses or exclude concussion. In the absence of this evidence, use of a consensus-derived multimodal concussion assessment tool is recommended (<a href=\"http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/early/2017/04/26/bjsports-2017-097506SCAT5.full.pdf&amp;token=DQJtagqB1eRmJhzNMBrECIFyyPwWFwUo/buGt4fs48wVMJ5iuqEvN2t5Ebn72N00zwcdXOyMXx3yt1qFOfydnBrIl2jFpaDgVGLM7WnNQU5CLgZ9zwju1nP4qvlnThxV&amp;TOPIC_ID=85893\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">SCAT5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

For those with milder symptoms and reassuring examination and test results, we suggest relative cognitive rest. However, limited activity is permitted provided it does not exacerbate symptoms. In our experience, exposure to video games, loud music, prolonged screen time, or mental activities requiring high levels of focus and concentration frequently induce symptoms and need to be curtailed for a few days after injury. </p><p>For patients with severe symptoms or concerning provocative testing results, additional limitations for a short period of time (eg, no phone, no test taking, no texting, no TV, no computer) may be helpful.

In the rare circumstance when severe nausea persists and there is no likelihood of intracranial hemorrhage (concern for which requires immediate evaluation in the emergency department), clinicians may give a low dose of a relatively safe antiemetic that is unlikely to cause side effects affecting the central nervous system, particularly altered mental status (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27407124\"><span class=\"h3\">Observation after injury and during sleep</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to ensure that a responsible adult is with the concussed athlete for the first six to eight hours after concussion primarily to monitor for any acute worsening during this time. Acute deterioration in mental status suggests possible intracranial hemorrhage and the need for emergent assessment.

Not only does this interfere with the cognitive rest needed for recovery, but it is difficult to assess accurately the cognitive status of a concussed athlete who is awakened every two to three hours. Instead, we suggest allowing the athlete to sleep, but recommend having a responsible adult look in on them every few hours to ensure that they do not show any sign of distress (eg, labored breathing, thrashing about).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2968689415\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Concussion can manifest in a wide variety of symptoms and signs that may or may not include loss of consciousness. No gross structural abnormalities are seen with neuroimaging. (See <a href=\"#H27406934\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for concussion include previous concussion, younger age (prepubescent athletes are at greater risk), sports involving collision (eg, American football, rugby), and possibly female gender. Concussion may be more likely following high-energy impact, double hits, and blows involving rotational forces, and in athletes who have recently sustained head trauma. (See <a href=\"#H27406945\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27406972\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of concussion may include physical (eg, headache, nausea, balance problems, dizziness, and visual changes), cognitive (eg, mental slowness, difficulty concentrating or remembering, speech difficulties), emotional (eg, irritability, sadness, emotional lability), or sleep-related findings (eg, drowsiness). (See <a href=\"#H27407025\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms of concussion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the potentially concussed athlete must include a careful physical examination; cognitive assessment alone is <strong>not</strong> sufficient. The examination should include observation for signs of concussion (eg, decreased coordination), assessment of memory and attentiveness, and a systematic neurologic examination (including assessment of cranial nerves, strength and sensation of the upper and lower extremities, ocular motor and vestibular function, and balance). It is important to include exertional testing, which may elicit symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H27407036\" class=\"local\">'Performance of the physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that a standardized multimodal assessment instrument be used to help ensure a proper evaluation. Suitable instruments include <a href=\"http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/early/2017/04/26/bjsports-2017-097506SCAT5.full.pdf&amp;token=DQJtagqB1eRmJhzNMBrECIFyyPwWFwUo/buGt4fs48wVMJ5iuqEvN2t5Ebn72N00zwcdXOyMXx3yt1qFOfydnBrIl2jFpaDgVGLM7WnNQU5CLgZ9zwju1nP4qvlnThxV&amp;TOPIC_ID=85893\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">SCAT5</a> and the CARE smart-phone application. (See <a href=\"#H8088077\" class=\"local\">'Concussion assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8087873\" class=\"local\">'Assessment instruments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It may not be possible to make a definitive diagnosis of concussion on the sideline. However, a preliminary diagnosis can generally be made on the basis of the history (including mechanism of injury), symptoms, and examination findings. Any new neurologic symptom or sign that develops following sports-related head trauma makes the diagnosis of concussion. (See <a href=\"#H8088201\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Athletes who have sustained a concussion but are not suspected of having any other significant injury should not be transferred to the emergency department (ED). Indications for transfer by ambulance to the ED include: prolonged loss of consciousness (eg, over one minute); concern for a cervical spine injury; high risk for intracranial bleed; examination findings suggestive of skull fracture; post-traumatic seizure; and, significant acute worsening of the patient's condition. (See <a href=\"#H27407053\" class=\"local\">'Indications for emergency department evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any athlete diagnosed with a concussion should not return to play that day. When the diagnosis of concussion is unclear but remains a possibility, the best approach is to remove the athlete from practice or play (&quot;when in doubt, sit them out&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a concussion is diagnosed, immediate initial treatment consists primarily of relative cognitive and physical rest. A responsible adult should remain with the concussed athlete for the first six to eight hours after concussion to monitor for any acute worsening. However, it is <strong>not</strong> necessary to wake the athlete every two to three hours throughout the night for reassessment. Over-the-counter analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>) are safe and reasonably effective for headache related to concussion. We recommend strictly avoiding any medications or substances that may adversely affect cognition, such as opioids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>, &quot;muscle relaxants&quot; (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclobenzaprine</a>), benzodiazepines, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The patient should be reevaluated within the next day or two by a physician. (See <a href=\"#H27407080\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideline-evaluation-of-concussion/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">McCrory P, Meeuwisse W, Dvorak J, et al.
