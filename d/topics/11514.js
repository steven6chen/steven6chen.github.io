Although relatively rare in general, it is one of the more common causes of disabling daytime sleepiness beginning in adolescence or early adulthood.</p><p>Narcolepsy can present in children as young as five or six years of age, and delays in diagnosis are common. Early-onset narcolepsy has some unique clinical features compared with later onset cases, including cataplexy with prominent oculobuccofacial involvement and daytime sleepiness manifesting primarily as habitual napping or irritability and hyperactivity.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of narcolepsy in children. Narcolepsy in adults is reviewed separately.

The underlying pathophysiology is a deficiency of central nervous system hypocretin (orexin), which is a peptide essential for maintaining alertness. (See <a href=\"#H31532819\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 (previously called narcolepsy without cataplexy) &ndash; Patients with narcolepsy type 2 demonstrate sleepiness and may experience hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis, but they do not have cataplexy. In contrast to narcolepsy type 1, levels of central nervous system hypocretin are usually normal. Some type 2 patients may gradually develop cataplexy over time, at which point they would be reclassified as type 1.</p><p/><p>There are no studies that have examined the relative proportions of type 1 and type 2 narcolepsy in children. Anecdotally, the age of onset of narcolepsy type 2 may be slightly later than narcolepsy type 1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31532813\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Narcolepsy is a lifelong disorder that most commonly begins in the first or second decade or in the early twenties. Approximately one-third of patients become symptomatic prior to 15 years of age, and up to 5 percent of cases begin before the age of five [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. With increased awareness of narcolepsy in children, there seems to be a trend towards increasing recognition of the disorder in the first decade of life.</p><p>There are few population-based estimates of the incidence and prevalence of narcolepsy in children. One European study estimated a pooled incidence rate of 0.83 per 100,000 person-years in children aged 5 to 19 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The overall prevalence of narcolepsy in Western countries has been estimated at 20 to 50 cases per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In 2009 and 2010, in the midst of the H1N1 influenza A pandemic, there was an abrupt, three- to fourfold increase in the incidence of narcolepsy in Europe and China, largely affecting children and adolescents. In Europe, the spike in new cases coincided with a mass influenza vaccination program which utilized Pandemrix, an ASO3-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. In studies that included human leucocyte antigen (HLA) testing, all affected children also possessed the HLA DQB1*0602 haplotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], which has a strong association with cataplexy. On the other hand, a similar ASO3-adjuvenated influenza vaccine produced in Quebec was not associated with increased risk of narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Further, an increase in the incidence of narcolepsy was also observed in China following the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, even though only 5.6 percent of the population had received the influenza vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It remains unclear whether the increase in incidence of narcolepsy in 2009 to 2010 was related to an antigen contained in the vaccine, the influenza infection itself<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], or to both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza#H592844613\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of pandemic H1N1 influenza ('swine influenza')&quot;, section on 'Narcolepsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31532819\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the clinical manifestations of narcolepsy type 1 (ie, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations) result from intrusion of fragments of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep onto wakefulness. Such intrusions may occur due to a deficiency of the neuropeptide hypocretin (also known as orexin), which normally stabilizes wakefulness and prevents inappropriate transitions into non-REM (NREM) or REM sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Clinicopathologic studies in narcolepsy type 1 show selective loss of hypocretin-secreting neurons in the hypothalamus and little or no detectable hypocretin in the cerebrospinal fluid. A compensatory increase in the histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary region has also been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Narcolepsy usually occurs sporadically, but genetic factors play an important role in the predisposition for narcolepsy. These and other factors are reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults#H3830849\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>One of the unique features of childhood narcolepsy type 1 is its association with obesity, which is often present at the onset of the sleep disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The mechanism underlying this association is not yet clear; decreased energy expenditure as well as a decrease in basal metabolic rate have each been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>While narcolepsy is idiopathic in the majority of cases, structural lesions affecting the diencephalon <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> brainstem occasionally precipitate secondary narcolepsy, perhaps via disruption of hypocretin secretion. Hypothalamic glioma, craniopharyngioma, sarcoidosis, and head injury have all been associated with secondary narcolepsy in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Narcolepsy can also occur with genetic syndromes such as Prader-Willi syndrome or Niemann-Pick disease type C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31532825\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is an essential clinical feature of narcolepsy and the most common presenting symptom in both children and adults. The classic tetrad of EDS, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis is often not recognizable in the early stages of the disorder and may gradually appear over time; this may contribute to delays in diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182340970\"><span class=\"h2\">Daytime sleepiness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Daytime sleepiness is present in all children with narcolepsy and is usually the first symptom. The onset can be as early as five to six years of age, but in rare cases it may be apparent even in the preschool years.</p><p>The severity of daytime sleepiness ranges from waxing and waning drowsiness to irresistible, unintended lapses into sleep (often referred to as sleep attacks). Lapses into sleep can occur throughout the day but are most likely to occur during sedentary activities such as sitting in a classroom, reading a book, or being driven in a car. Left undisturbed, sleep attacks in children often last 30 to 90 minutes (longer than in adults with narcolepsy) and are not consistently followed by a refreshed feeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Daytime sleepiness sometimes manifests as habitual napping that occurs beyond the age when a child typically grows out of the need for daily naps. Habitual napping is uncommon in healthy children after five to six years of age, and when present, it should raise suspicion for pathologic sleepiness.</p><p>When sleepiness is mild or subtle, parents may instead report a history of irritability, poor concentration, or memory impairment, especially in younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Children with daytime sleepiness can be mistaken for being &quot;lazy&quot; and may become the target of negative comments from their peers.</p><p>Daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy may be associated with automatic behaviors of which the child is unaware. This can manifest as a segment of sloppy handwriting in an assignment or performing routine tasks with little recollection of them afterwards.</p><p>The Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) has been validated in children ages 11 to 15 years old and can be used to quantify subjective daytime sleepiness and monitor response to therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104093\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104093 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Total PDSS scores range from 0 to 32, with higher scores indicative of more severe sleepiness. The median PDSS score in healthy teenagers is 16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a cohort of 31 children with newly diagnosed narcolepsy (mean age 13 years), the mean PDSS score was 22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) that has been modified for children is also used by some clinicians, with elevated scores indicating sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Objective assessment of daytime sleepiness requires a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), though its clinical use under the age of five years is challenging, in part because of insufficient normative data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H376541786\" class=\"local\">'Polysomnography and MSLT'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31532831\"><span class=\"h2\">Cataplexy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cataplexy is the most specific symptom of narcolepsy. Cataplexy is seen in approximately 80 percent of children with narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It typically emerges at the same time as excessive sleepiness or shortly thereafter.</p><p>Cataplexy is characterized by sudden, transient loss of muscle tone; the weakness or paralysis usually arises in response to strong emotions such as laughter, surprise, anger, fright, or anticipation of reward. Consciousness is fully preserved. Episodes usually last a few seconds to three to five minutes. The severity of attacks ranges from a slight head or shoulder drop to sudden collapse to the floor.</p><p>Oculobuccofacial involvement is prominent in children, manifested by the jaw dropping open, eyelid drooping (ptosis), head rolling, or tongue thrusting movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This has given rise to the term &quot;cataplectic facies,&quot; which is a unique clinical feature of childhood presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The usual triggering emotions are not always apparent in children, and the symptom complex is sometimes confused with tics or even myasthenia gravis. Over time, a more classic form of cataplexy often emerges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H31532837\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The frequency of cataplexy is variable. There can be dozens of cataplexy episodes in a day, rendering a clumsy and uncoordinated appearance to the child. When in doubt as to the nature of an episode, video clips provided by parents of cataplexy or cataplexy-like behaviors can be very helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182340976\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis are seen in approximately 50 to 60 percent of children with narcolepsy. Like cataplexy, these phenomena may represent episodic intrusion of fragments of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep onto wakefulness. </p><p>Hypnagogic hallucinations consist of vivid, dreamlike imagery at sleep onset; the same phenomena can more occasionally occur on awakening, when they are then referred to as hypnopompic hallucinations. Sleep paralysis is a momentary inability to move the body, most commonly on awakening in the morning or during the night, but occasionally as one is drifting off to sleep.</p><p>Children below the age of five to six years are usually unable to provide a reliable history for hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Children may find the experiences frightening, such that symptoms are initially attributed to nightmares, sleep terrors, or other parasomnias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children#H27172810\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleepwalking and other parasomnias in children&quot;, section on 'Sleep terrors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2546397283\"><span class=\"h2\">Other sleep disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in adults, nighttime sleep is also disturbed in children with narcolepsy, with frequent awakenings, which may or may not be associated with periodic leg movements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults#H23311136\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Other features'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, complex motor behaviors may arise during REM sleep due to a lack of physiologic atonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In a series of 40 children with type 1 narcolepsy who underwent video polysomnography, 32 percent of patients exhibited complex motor behaviors during REM sleep consistent with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), compared with none of 22 age- and sex-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Movements included both vigorous dream enactment motions (eg, vivid gestures, throwing something, raising the head and reaching or grabbing) and pantomime-like events characterized by slow, calm, and repetitive gesturing. Events were more common among children with impaired nighttime sleep, worse daytime sleepiness, and cataplectic <span class=\"nowrap\">facies/status</span> cataplecticus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261010357\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropsychiatric symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression is a common neuropsychiatric sequela of narcolepsy in both children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, children are at higher risk for aggressive behavior, attentional difficulties, social and emotional distress, and decreased school performance and engagement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182340989\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity and precocious puberty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obesity is common in children with narcolepsy and tends to happen suddenly near the onset of other symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Within a few years of diagnosis, approximately two-thirds of children with narcolepsy are overweight or obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/15,31,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,31,37</a>]. The age of onset of narcolepsy symptoms seems to be earlier in children with obesity compared with those who are not obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Precocious puberty also occurs with increased frequency in children with narcolepsy, affecting 17 percent of children with narcolepsy compared with 2 percent of obese controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31532837\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Narcolepsy is not the most common cause of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in children, although the more severe the sleepiness, the more important it is to consider narcolepsy as a potential cause.</p><p>Particularly when there is no history of cataplexy, alternative and more common causes of EDS should be considered, including insufficient sleep due to poor sleep hygiene and fragmented sleep due to disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104798\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104798 \">table 2</a>). Other causes of sleepiness to consider are medication side effects, substance abuse, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (in teenagers), depression, and underlying medical conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of sleep disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Excessive daytime sleepiness'</a>.)</p><p>Most of these causes of EDS can be differentiated from narcolepsy by history and the absence of additional clinical features of narcolepsy (ie, cataplexy, sleep attacks, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis). Notably, however, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and sleep attacks are not specific to narcolepsy and can occur as isolated phenomena, precipitated by insufficient or fragmented sleep. Wrist actigraphy and sleep logs maintained for two to three weeks can help exclude inadequate sleep hygiene and delayed sleep phase syndrome. Children with obstructive sleep apnea often but not always have excessive snoring or other indications on history of abnormal breathing during sleep, and polysomnography is needed to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H934949135\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Kleine-Levin syndrome and idiopathic hypersomnia are more rare central disorders of hypersomnolence which, like narcolepsy, may cause severe daytime sleepiness beginning in the teenage years.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kleine-Levin syndrome is unique for its episodic course of hypersomnia lasting days to weeks followed by periods of normal sleep-wake function. During episodes of hypersomnia, patients commonly have cognitive disturbances, memory impairment, derealization, and severe apathy. They may also exhibit disinhibition in the form of hyperphagia and hypersexuality. The episodic nature of EDS in Kleine-Levin syndrome and the prominent cognitive and behavioral disturbances distinguish it from narcolepsy, which manifests with relatively constant, nonremitting symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kleine-Levin syndrome (recurrent hypersomnia)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with idiopathic hypersomnia do not have cataplexy but they may share other symptoms typical of narcolepsy, such as hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or sleep attacks. Idiopathic hypersomnia is typically considered only after other causes of sleepiness have been ruled out by both history and polysomnography (PSG). PSG followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) are required for the diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia. These tests show characteristic findings that are distinct from narcolepsy (ie, a shortened mean sleep latency but fewer than two sleep-onset REM periods [SOREMPs]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-hypersomnia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic hypersomnia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The symptom of cataplexy in children is sometimes confused with seizures. Unlike cataplexy, however, seizures are not typically triggered by strong emotions. When cataplexy affects buccofacial muscles, the differential diagnosis may include myasthenias gravis (MG) or tics. A history of excessive sleepiness, which is almost always present before or concurrent with cataplexy in children with narcolepsy, is typically absent in children with MG or tics. In addition, the ptosis associated with MG is typically present throughout the day, whereas cataplexy is episodic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperkinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Tic disorders'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376541811\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of narcolepsy is established on the basis of characteristic clinical features combined with nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The diagnosis should be suspected in children presenting with the subacute onset of severe daytime sleepiness leading to sleep attacks <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> long and nonrestorative naps, particularly when there is also a history of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, or new obesity. Cataplexy in young children can be subtle and involve primarily the buccofacial muscles. (See <a href=\"#H31532825\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p>Because the diagnosis rests heavily on PSG and MSLT, which require an overnight stay in a sleep laboratory and meticulous planning to avoid confounding effects of sleep insufficiency and medications, children with suspected narcolepsy should be referred to a sleep medicine physician with pediatric training or experience for evaluation prior to formal diagnostic sleep testing. Lumbar puncture for measurement of hypocretin-1 levels is only advisable in selected patients and should not be performed prior to <span class=\"nowrap\">PSG/MSLT</span>.

Children, including teenagers, need more sleep than adults, but no consensus has been established for how much sleep is sufficient, at each age, to permit valid interpretation of an MSLT on the next day. </p><p>Diagnostic PSG and MSLT require meticulous preparation to avoid confounding effects of sleep insufficiency and medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/28,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,39</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications that can impact sleep-wake function (eg, stimulants, antidepressants) should be stopped for at least two weeks prior to the study, provided it is safe to do so. This may require input and advice from the patient's primary care physician <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> child psychiatrist. Stimulants and antidepressants suppress rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and can prevent the appearance of SOREMPs; conversely, abrupt discontinuation can result in REM rebound effects that include the appearance of SOREMPs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is suspicion for inadequate sleep hygiene or circadian rhythm disturbances (most commonly delayed sleep phase syndrome), wrist actigraphy and sleep logs should be obtained for two to three weeks prior to the diagnostic testing. Such conditions can result in false positive MSLT results.</p><p/><p>PSG consists of continuous multichannel recording of sleep using electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and electromyography (EMG) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polysomnography-in-infants-and-children#H28395551\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polysomnography in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Recorded signals'</a>). PSG findings in children with narcolepsy are nonspecific, but common abnormalities include a sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) period, increased number of spontaneous arousals per hour of sleep, elevated periodic limb movement index <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;5/hour</span> of sleep), and preservation of muscle tone in REM sleep (REM sleep without atonia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/33,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,40</a>].</p><p>An MSLT is carried out on the morning after the PSG and consists of four or five 20-minute nap opportunities at two-hour intervals across the day. The latency until sleep onset is measured for each nap opportunity, and multichannel sleep recordings are analyzed to detect sleep stage transitions and the presence or absence of REM sleep during each nap. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of sleep disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Multiple sleep latency test'</a>.)</p><p>In the proper clinical context, the presence of two or more sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) and a mean sleep latency of &lt;8 minutes on the MSLT is diagnostic of narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/28,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,41</a>]. If a SOREMP is identified on the nocturnal PSG, the MSLT needs to show only one additional SOREMP plus mean sleep latency of &lt;8 minutes to make a diagnosis of narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H376541822\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnosis of narcolepsy in younger children can be difficult and sometimes requires serial sleep studies to make a definitive diagnosis. In particular, the diagnostic feature of two or more SOREMPs is not consistently present in the early stages of the disorder in children and young adults. By the time this MSLT feature becomes definitive, nocturnal REM latency on PSG also becomes markedly reduced (eg, &lt;75 minutes, when normal is about 120 to 140 minutes in a child).</p><p>The MSLT has not been applied in children less than five years of age. Normative values for mean sleep latency on an MSLT in young children are not well established but appear to be in the 18- to 23-minute range (ie, longer than the standard 20-minute nap opportunity on an MSLT) and decrease progressively with sexual maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. When narcolepsy is suspected in preschool children, the diagnosis may be established with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 testing. (See <a href=\"#H376541792\" class=\"local\">'CSF hypocretin-1 testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376541792\"><span class=\"h2\">CSF hypocretin-1 testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF is primarily a research tool and is indicated only in selected patients. A low CSF hypocretin-1 level (&lt;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> is highly sensitive and specific for a diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1, but issues with standardization and availability of testing limit widespread clinical use. A commercially available assay for CSF hypocretin may soon become available, but in the meantime, clinicians interested in the assay will need to contact research labs directly.</p><p>Testing is most useful when the diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 is equivocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Examples include a child below the age of five years, in whom the MSLT is not validated, and instances in which the patient is already on an antidepressant medication, which cannot be safely stopped for diagnostic sleep tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376541798\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroimaging in patients with narcolepsy is typically normal but may be indicated to rule out alternative causes of excessive sleepiness, particularly in the presence of focal neurologic findings or a history suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. </p><p>We do not routinely test for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQB1*0602 haplotype. Although it is present in the majority of individuals with narcolepsy type 1, it is not sufficiently specific to be useful as a clinical test.

We encourage psychological counseling from the time of diagnosis, including family counseling if needed.</p><p>Children may need special accommodations at school to promote an optimal learning environment. Clinicians and parents may find it helpful to work closely with a school guidance counselor or other school official to ensure the opportunity for a brief nap. Schools can sometimes make other accommodations to improve a child's alertness, such as sitting at the front of the class or taking breaks midway through long tests.</p><p>Safety considerations are important to review. Patients should stay away from heights and sharp, moving machinery. Caution may be required with swimming if it triggers cataplexy. People with narcolepsy have an increased risk of car accidents due to sleepiness. We caution adolescents against driving for more than 25 to 30 minutes at a time. Further considerations on driving safety are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults#H364808752\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of narcolepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Driving safety'</a>.)</p><p>Alcohol should be strictly avoided due to potential adverse interactions with medications and its potential to worsen sleep quality.</p><p>Young people with narcolepsy may also benefit from advice regarding the choice of a career. In general, individuals with narcolepsy may be more at ease in jobs that allow for standing and moving about, such as a school teacher or physical therapist, than those that require long periods of quiet sitting or reading.

Nonpharmacologic strategies are only partially effective, and drug therapy is required in nearly all children.</p><p>The choice of first-line pharmacotherapy should be individualized according to the symptom that is most bothersome to the patient (eg, sleepiness or cataplexy), consideration of side effect profiles and risks, and patient and clinician preferences. Once the most significant symptom has been controlled, other symptoms can then be treated with additional medication, if necessary. Monotherapy is preferred but not always possible. All children on drug therapy require careful and periodic monitoring to determine efficacy and adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>Medications used to treat narcolepsy are listed in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104801\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104801 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104803\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104803 \">table 6</a>).

There have been no head-to-head studies comparing various medications in children with narcolepsy, and both classes of medications have similar effects on alertness and daytime function in children with narcolepsy.</p><p>We generally start with a central nervous system stimulant to target sleepiness, and then use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">modafinil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=armodafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">armodafinil</a> as second-line therapy if there is an inadequate response to stimulants. Our preference for starting with a stimulant rather than a wake-promoting agent is based primarily on the extensive experience with the safety and tolerability of stimulants in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the more limited experience with modafinil or armodafinil in children. Cost of medications and insurance coverage may also influence the choice of first-line therapy. If cataplexy and daytime sleepiness are equally bothersome, we typically start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium oxybate</a> rather than a stimulant. (See <a href=\"#H162878004\" class=\"local\">'Cataplexy'</a> below.)</p><p>The choice among various stimulants depends largely on individual preferences of the clinician and family as well as considerations of duration of action and whether or not the child can swallow pills. Recommended starting and maximum doses of stimulants for children with narcolepsy are the same as for more common indications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104801\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104801 \">table 5</a>). Stimulant medications are typically started at the lowest dose that may produce an effect and increased gradually (every three to seven days) until target symptoms improve. Since optimizing daytime alertness for attendance at school is important, a morning dose of a short-acting agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylphenidate</a> may need to be combined with a sustained-release formulation. An additional dose of methylphenidate (regular formulation or sustained release) may also be required in the early afternoon at school, followed by a low-dose, regular formulation upon return home from school. The same concept applies to the titration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextroamphetamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dextroamphetamine</a>.</p><p>Relatively common side effects of all stimulants include anorexia, poor growth or weight loss, sleep disturbance, jitteriness, emotional lability, and the development of tics.

The rationale for sodium oxybate as the initial agent is that it targets both cataplexy and daytime sleepiness, and it is the most potent anticataplectic therapy available.

There are no detailed studies of sodium oxybate in children with narcolepsy type 2, and other medications for sleepiness may be adequate, better tolerated, and less costly.

It stabilizes nocturnal sleep architecture, which is often disrupted in patients with narcolepsy. Randomized trials in adults with narcolepsy type 1 have shown that sodium oxybate reduces the number of cataplexy attacks, improves daytime wakefulness, and reduces sleep attacks compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/narcolepsy-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Most cases appear to be sporadic in individuals with an underlying genetic susceptibility. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 2, or narcolepsy without cataplexy, is not well understood. (See <a href=\"#H31532807\" class=\"local\">'Forms of narcolepsy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H31532819\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-third of all cases of narcolepsy present before the age of 15 years. Narcolepsy very rarely presents in children younger than five or six years of age. (See <a href=\"#H31532813\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is an essential clinical feature of narcolepsy and the most common presenting symptom in both children and adults. The severity of daytime sleepiness ranges from waxing and waning drowsiness to irresistible, unintended lapses into sleep (sleep attacks). In younger children, EDS sometimes manifests as habitual napping that occurs beyond the age when a child typically grows out of the need for daily naps. When sleepiness is mild or subtle, parents may instead report a history of irritability, poor concentration, or memory impairment. (See <a href=\"#H182340970\" class=\"local\">'Daytime sleepiness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cataplexy in young children can manifest predominantly in the buccofacial muscles, with jaw opening, eyelid drooping (ptosis), head rolling, or tongue thrusting movements. Additional clinical features of narcolepsy, such as hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis, may be absent or difficult to elicit in young children. (See <a href=\"#H31532831\" class=\"local\">'Cataplexy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H182340976\" class=\"local\">'Hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity is common in children with narcolepsy and tends to happen suddenly near the onset of other symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H182340989\" class=\"local\">'Obesity and precocious puberty'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative causes of daytime sleepiness in children include insufficient sleep due to poor sleep hygiene and fragmented sleep due to disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104798\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104798 \">table 2</a>). Other causes of sleepiness to consider are medication side effects, substance abuse, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (in teenagers), depression, and underlying medical conditions. The differential diagnosis also includes more rare central disorders of hypersomnolence, such as idiopathic hypersomnia and Kleine-Levin syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H31532837\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of narcolepsy is established on the basis of characteristic clinical features combined with nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In the proper clinical context, the presence of two or more sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMPs) and a mean sleep latency of &lt;8 minutes on MSLT is diagnostic of narcolepsy. Cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 testing is only indicated in selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H376541811\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narcolepsy is a lifelong disorder. There are no curative therapies currently available, and management is symptomatic. Maintenance of regular sleep-wake schedules and planned naps are the cornerstones of behavioral therapy. Psychosocial support is critical in children, as the disorder commonly affects behavior, mental health, peer relationships, and school performance. (See <a href=\"#H31532857\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral and lifestyle modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to behavioral and lifestyle modifications, we recommend pharmacotherapy in nearly all children with narcolepsy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Selection of initial pharmacotherapy should be individualized based on the symptom that is most bothersome to the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104801\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104801 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104803\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104803 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H31532863\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children whose predominant symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness, we suggest initial therapy with a stimulant medication such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylphenidate</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Wake-promoting agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">modafinil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=armodafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">armodafinil</a> are a reasonable alternative to stimulants, although experience with these drugs in children is more limited and rare severe adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and severe psychiatric events, have been reported. (See <a href=\"#H162877997\" class=\"local\">'Daytime sleepiness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children whose predominant symptom is cataplexy or patients with equally bothersome cataplexy and sleepiness, we suggest initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium oxybate</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Sodium oxybate is not indicated for children with narcolepsy type 2 (narcolepsy without cataplexy). Tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors may also be useful for cataplexy, particularly in children with comorbid depression.
