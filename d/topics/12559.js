Exercise two-dimensional (2D) imaging is used primarily to detect the presence and extent of coronary artery disease by provoking regional ischemia with resulting wall motion abnormalities. The addition of exercise Doppler permits evaluation of valvular function, pulmonary artery pressure, left ventricular outflow tract gradients, and global ventricular systolic and diastolic function.</p><p>Stress echocardiography can be accomplished using either exercise (treadmill or bicycle) or pharmacologic agents (predominantly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>) as the stress mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Echocardiographic contrast agents may be useful in enhancing endocardial border definition when two or more segments of the left ventricle are not well visualized.

However, there is evidence that such stress testing can be safely performed in these patients. In a review of 262 patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter &gt;4 cm (average 5.5 cm), one patient (0.4 percent) with a 6.1 cm aneurysm had a contained rupture 12 hours after exercise, which was successfully repaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In 98 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms &ge;4 cm who underwent dobutamine stress echocardiograms, there were no vascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406169622\"><span class=\"h1\">STRESS TECHNIQUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise two-dimensional echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise stress is preferable to pharmacologic stress for patients who are capable of performing an exercise test, as exercise capacity is an important predictor of outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

These guidelines note that if evaluation of wall motion is the main purpose of the test, then treadmill exercise is usually used, whereas if stress Doppler information is desired, bicycle exercise should be considered because it enables Doppler as well as wall motion evaluation during each stage of exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As with any exercise stress test, exercise should be performed until the patient feels that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> cannot exercise further due to fatigue or symptoms, although in some instances there may be appropriate endpoints determined by the provider or the protocol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results&quot;, section on 'Test endpoints'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h4\">Treadmill</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise echocardiography is most commonly performed using a treadmill protocol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70044\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70044 \">table 1</a>). Echocardiographic images are acquired prior to and immediately after completion of exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. This method requires that the patient transfer from the treadmill into a recumbent position for imaging within a few seconds so that a complete set of images can be obtained as rapidly as possible, usually within 60 seconds after cessation of exercise. Use of digitized images permits review of multiple cardiac cycles, as well as side-by-side comparison of these images. This approach maximizes accuracy of interpretation. Continuous recording of images is also recommended as backup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>For maximal diagnostic accuracy, images should be obtained prior to the heart rate decreasing toward baseline. Early image acquisition is necessary since ischemia-induced wall motion abnormalities may resolve rapidly as the heart rate slows, causing a decrease in the sensitivity of the test, especially for single vessel disease. The experience and competence of a laboratory's <span class=\"nowrap\">clinician/sonographer</span> team influence the reliability of this test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Bicycle ergometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some laboratories perform stress echocardiography using supine or upright bicycle ergometry. A typical symptom-limited supine bicycle protocol starts at a workload of 25 watts and increases by 25 watt increments every three minutes until an endpoint is achieved.</p><p>A major advantage of supine bicycle ergometry is that it allows continuous monitoring of wall motion during exercise. Imaging throughout the study may permit detection of the onset of wall motion abnormalities and improve sensitivity of detection of coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Moreover, acquisition of Doppler imaging during each stage of exercise is also feasible during supine bicycle exercise. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic stress echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic stress is employed in patients who are unable to perform exercise testing. In addition, it may be preferable to exercise testing for preoperative risk and myocardial viability assessment since the majority of data validating stress echocardiography for myocardial viability involved pharmacologic (largely <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>) stress. </p><p>Pharmacologic stress testing most commonly involves the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> with the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> as needed to achieve the target heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. The American Society of Echocardiography guidelines recommend dobutamine as preferable to vasodilators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regadenoson-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regadenoson</a>) as there is greater experience using dobutamine for stress echocardiography in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, dobutamine and vasodilators are equally potent ischemic stressors for inducing wall abnormalities in the presence of a critical epicardial coronary artery stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. As such, dipyridamole is a popular pharmacologic regimen for stress echocardiography in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Dobutamine stress echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress test components are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Graded <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> infusion in five three-minute stages starting at 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute,</span> followed by 10, 20, 30, and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80855 \">figure 1</a>). <br/><br/>An initial dose of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute</span> may be used in tests evaluating viability. Low-dose stages facilitate recognition of viability in segments with abnormal function at rest, even when viability evaluation is not the main focus of the test.

Some laboratories also use a sustained isometric hand grip or a low-level dynamic foot exercise (with or without atropine) in the late stages of the dobutamine protocol as a supplemental maneuver to achieve peak heart rate. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Handgrip exercise'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>During <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> echocardiography, echocardiographic images are acquired prior to the start of the dobutamine infusion, at the completion of each stage, and during recovery. </p><p>Variations from the standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> protocol have been proposed. Some laboratories use a sixth dose of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute;</span> others, based on pharmacokinetic data, extend the 40 mcg infusion to five minutes. Some omit the first low-dose stage when no viability evaluation is sought. If only viability assessment is performed, it is generally not necessary to administer doses higher than 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute</span>. Accelerated dobutamine protocols have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>The standard endpoint for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography is the achievement of target heart rate, defined as at least 85 percent of the age-predicted maximum heart rate. However, the test may also be terminated following the development of significant symptoms, new or worsening wall motion abnormalities of moderate degree, significant arrhythmias, hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg), or severe hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results&quot;, section on 'Test endpoints'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6715897\"><span class=\"h4\">Effect of beta blocker therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of beta-blockers may attenuate heart rate response as well as evidence of myocardial ischemia during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23</a>]. However, the effect of beta-blockers on heart rate response to dobutamine can usually be overcome by the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Moreover, performing the stress echocardiogram while the patient stays on all medications, including beta-blockers, may be useful for assessment of treatment efficacy. Some stress echocardiography laboratories recommend withholding beta-blockers prior to the test while others typically recommend continuation of beta-blockers and all cardiac medications prior to stress echocardiograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. While the safety and prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography for patients who continue taking their home medication is well established, the referring care provider may decide to withhold beta-blockers in certain circumstances (eg, to maximize the sensitivity of the test for the initial diagnosis of coronary heart disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Vasodilator stress echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dipyridamole</a> is administered at up to 0.84 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in two separate infusions: 0.56 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> over four minutes (&quot;standard dose&quot;), followed by four minutes of no dose and, if an adequate physiologic response is not achieved, then an additional 0.28 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is given over two minutes.

Imaging is performed prior to and after starting adenosine infusion. Adenosine is a shorter-acting agent employed for myocardial perfusion contrast echocardiography and, to a lesser extent, to detect stress-induced changes in wall motion, but this method has not been in wide clinical use. Vasodilator stress may be better suited for perfusion than wall motion analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a> are contraindicated in patients with reactive airway obstruction or significant conduction defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporary pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tachycardia induced by a pacemaker is an alternative to pharmacologic stress in patients who are not able to exercise.

Baseline and stress images are acquired in a variety of standard echocardiographic windows, including apical (four-chamber, long axis and two-chamber), parasternal (long axis and short axis), and subcostal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-36</a>].

Images are also compared with pre-peak and peak stress, during pharmacologic stress or with bicycle exercise. With stress, the normal left ventricle becomes hypercontractile, cavity size is smaller, and ejection fraction increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Various professional society recommendations for chamber quantification have suggested either a 16- or 17-segment model for left ventricular regional wall motion analysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55855 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64968\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64968 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37,38</a>]. Function in each segment is graded (normal, hyperdynamic, hypokinetic, akinetic, dyskinetic, or aneurysmal) at rest and with stress. In addition, global left ventricular systolic function and cavity size are evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transthoracic-echocardiography-normal-cardiac-anatomy-and-tomographic-views\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transthoracic echocardiography: Normal cardiac anatomy and tomographic views&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Detection of segmental left ventricular dysfunction is useful in diagnosing and localizing obstructive coronary artery disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55855 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61847\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61847 \">figure 4</a>). The development of new or worsening segmental wall motion with stress suggests presence of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenoses supplying the abnormal segments. Decrease of global left ventricular ejection fraction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased left ventricular end-systolic volume, suggest presence of severe obstructive coronary arterial disease such as flow-limiting left main stenosis or severe multivessel coronary artery disease. </p><p>Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography enables identification of dysfunctional but viable myocardial segments. In segments that have resting dysfunction but are viable (hibernating or stunned), low-dose dobutamine infusion (2.5 or 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute)</span> leads to improved contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As the dobutamine dose is increased, a biphasic response is detected with the segmental motion improving at low-dose and then deteriorating at a higher dose to a level of dysfunction that is worse than it was at rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-echocardiography/abstract/11,12,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,39-41</a>]. Such a response is highly specific for identifying a dysfunctional hibernating segment that is served by a stenotic coronary artery. The highest sensitivity for viability detection is obtained by identification of improvement with low-dose dobutamine; highest specificity is achieved when a biphasic response occurs.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar to other modalities of stress testing (eg, exercise treadmill testing without imaging, radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging, etc), the majority of stress echocardiograms are performed to evaluate for known or suspected coronary heart disease (CHD). In addition, because of its ability to assess hemodynamics, stress echocardiography can be useful in a variety of other non-CHD conditions (eg, valvular heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, etc). (See <a href=\"#H406169795\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise stress is preferred to pharmacologic stress for patients who can perform an exercise test. Exercise echocardiography is most commonly performed using a treadmill protocol, with echocardiographic images acquired prior to and immediately after the peak treadmill exercise. However, supine and upright bicycle ergometry are other well validated methods of exercise echocardiography, with the major advantage of allowing for monitoring of wall motion and Doppler parameters during exercise. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Exercise two-dimensional echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic stress is employed in patients who are unable to perform exercise testing. In addition, it may be preferred to exercise testing for preoperative risk and myocardial viability assessment since the majority of data validating stress echocardiography for this indication involved pharmacologic (largely <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>) stress. During dobutamine echocardiography, echocardiographic images are acquired prior to the start of the dobutamine infusion, at the completion of each stage, at peak stress, and during recovery. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic stress echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of beta-blockers may attenuate heart rate response as well as evidence of myocardial ischemia during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography. However, the effect of beta-blockers on heart rate response to dobutamine can usually be overcome by the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H6715897\" class=\"local\">'Effect of beta blocker therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baseline (resting) echocardiogram obtained prior to stress testing should include a screening assessment of ventricular function, chamber sizes, wall thicknesses, aortic root diameter, pericardial effusion, and gross valvular structure and function. The echocardiographic imaging protocol that is chosen for stress imaging should be tailored to the indication for the test. (See <a href=\"#H406171424\" class=\"local\">'Imaging techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no known adverse effects from diagnostic ultrasound at clinical imaging frequencies, so the addition of echocardiographic imaging to stress testing (either exercise or pharmacologic) does not alter the underlying risk of the stress test.
