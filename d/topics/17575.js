Posttraumatic osteomyelitis can occur in up to 25 percent of open fractures; the risk depends upon the following factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of soft tissue injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degree of bacterial contamination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of underlying vascular insufficiency (eg, peripheral vascular disease or diabetes)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequacy of surgical debridement</p><p/><p>Classification to assess the risk of infection with regard to wound severity and patient comorbidities are discussed separately.

Hematogenous osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microorganisms can be introduced directly into bone in the setting of trauma or via contiguous spread from injury to overlying soft tissue. They proliferate in the presence of devitalized tissues containing clotted blood and necrotic bone.</p><p>Posttraumatic osteomyelitis pathogens in adults may include skin flora, soil organisms, or nosocomial pathogens acquired in the hospital before, during, or after surgical intervention. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and aerobic gram-negative bacilli are the most common organisms; other pathogens, including enterococci, anaerobes, fungi, and mycobacteria, have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/5,9-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9-15</a>]. Similar microbiology is seen in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Wound infections among combat casualties with tibial fractures have been associated with drug-resistant aerobic gram-negative organisms, including <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Cultures obtained at the time of initial debridement do not always reflect the pathogens involved once osteomyelitis has developed; the correlation is about 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The reason for this observation is likely multifactorial; not all microbes colonizing the wound at the time of injury cause sustained infection in the bone, and pathogens not present at the initial injury may colonize and infect wounds subsequently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hallmarks of posttraumatic osteomyelitis are nonunion of the fracture site and poor wound healing after wound closure. Other symptoms may include fever and local wound drainage, erythema, warmth, swelling, and pain.</p><p>The tibia is the bone most frequently involved by posttraumatic osteomyelitis, likely because it is the most common site of open fracture given its lack of muscle covering and limited anastomotic blood supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/10,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Establishing an accurate diagnosis of osteomyelitis is critical, since the infection can require prolonged antibiotic therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aggressive surgical intervention. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is discussed in detail separately.

There is no need for obtaining routine cultures of bone biopsies or fluid collections obtained in the setting of superficial debridement of necrotic tissue. If subsequent debridement is performed for suspected infection, culture collection (aerobic and anaerobic) is warranted at this time.</p><p>Administration of antibiotics (as discussed below) and tetanus immunization are also warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The decision to use internal or external fixation for stabilization and union is made on a case-by-case basis. Once union is achieved, fixation hardware should be removed (if possible) and additional debridement performed. Final steps include bone grafting (if needed) and wound closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/23-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-33</a>].</p><p>Delay in wound closure is generally appropriate in Gustilo type II or III fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F113281\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113281 \">table 1</a>). One review of wound closure in open fractures suggests primary closure as an option for a specific subset of wounds with no contamination, debrided within 12 hours, with good residual soft tissue that is easily approximated, and good vascular supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of parenteral antibiotics as soon as possible (ideally within six hours) after open trauma is warranted to reduce the risk of soft tissue infection or osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,21,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21,35,36</a>]. The efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics was demonstrated in a meta-analysis including 913 patients with open fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]; use of prophylactic antibiotics was associated with an absolute reduction in infection of 0.08 (95% CI 0.04-0.12) with a number needed to treat of 13.</p><p>In general, prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be directed against gram-positive organisms; for type III fractures, additional gram-negative coverage should be added (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F113281\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113281 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37</a>]. In the setting of fecal or potential clostridial contamination (eg, farm-related injuries), high-dose penicillin should be added. For open fractures associated with water exposure, antibiotic therapy to cover pathogens such as <em>Aeromonas</em> and <em>Pseudomonas</em> may be warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-following-water-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections following water exposure&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cefazolin</a> is a reasonable agent for gram-positive coverage; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> is an acceptable alternative. For patients at risk for methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53504 \">table 2</a>), prophylactic antibiotics should include an agent with activity against MRSA such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>. Reasonable agents for gram-negative coverage include cephalosporins (late generation), extended-spectrum penicillins, or aminoglycosides (once-daily dosing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Fluoroquinolones may have a detrimental effect on fracture healing and may be associated with higher infection rates in type III open fractures when used as a single agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36</a>].</p><p>Antibiotic-impregnated beads placed in and around the fracture site may be useful as an adjunct to systemic antibiotics for prevention or treatment of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>]. Data are most robust for polymethylmethacrylate beads; these are typically removed within two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/11,45-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,45-51</a>]. Antibiotic-impregnated calcium sulfate beads are absorbable; this approach has been used as a bone substitute and delivery system for antibiotics repairing bony defects in open fractures caused by combat-related injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/44,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,52</a>].</p><p>The duration of prophylactic antibiotic therapy depends on the classification of the fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F113281\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113281 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,2,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,53,54</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For closed fractures, a single dose of antibiotics at the time of surgical repair is sufficient.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For Gustilo type I and II open fractures, antibiotics may be discontinued after 24 hours.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For Gustilo type III open fractures, antibiotics may be discontinued after 72 hours or within a day after soft tissue injuries have been closed.</p><p/><p>Prolonged administration of prophylactic antibiotics does not reduce the risk of infection and can lead to the development of resistant organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/2,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Established osteomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of established osteomyelitis or infected nonunion after an open fracture requires debridement, bone biopsy culture to identify the causative microorganism(s), fracture fixation (if needed), and antimicrobial therapy tailored to culture and susceptibility results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-osteomyelitis-following-trauma-in-adults/abstract/12,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,56,57</a>].
