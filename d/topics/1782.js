(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Endoscopic surveillance is recommended for patients with BE because of its malignant potential in the hope of detecting dysplasia before it progresses to adenocarcinoma. Esophagectomy has traditionally been recommended for patients found to have high-grade dysplasia or early cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Endoscopic therapy has been proven to be a safe, effective, and less invasive alternative to surgery for treating such patients.</p><p>Endoscopic resection (ER) is an endoscopic approach in which the neoplastic epithelium is excised, thus allowing for a definitive histologic diagnosis while also potentially being curative. ER has been applied not only to BE with high-grade dysplasia but also to early cancer in which the risk of lymph node involvement or hematogenous dissemination is low enough to justify a relatively conservative approach compared with esophagectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several studies have demonstrated that ER is safe and effective for complete resection of superficial lesions and offers the advantage of histopathologic verification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior ER does not impair subsequent ablative therapy (eg, photodynamic therapy, argon plasma coagulation, or radiofrequency ablation) for treatment of larger areas of residual Barrett's mucosa.

Photodynamic therapy, radiofrequency ablation, a general approach to BE, and other treatment options for superficial esophageal cancer are presented separately.

The Vienna classification is based upon the histopathologic evaluation of endoscopically acquired biopsies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 1: No dysplasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 2: Indefinite for dysplasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 3: Low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (low-grade <span class=\"nowrap\">adenoma/dysplasia)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 4: High-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (high-grade <span class=\"nowrap\">adenoma/dysplasia,</span> noninvasive carcinoma or suspicion of invasive carcinoma)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 5: Invasive epithelial neoplasia (intramucosal carcinoma, submucosal carcinoma, or beyond)</p><p/><p>The distinction between categories 4 and 5 can be difficult since it depends in part upon the size, location, depth, and number of biopsies. In category 4, there is no obvious invasion beyond the epithelial basal membrane. Category 5 is subdivided based upon whether there is invasion into the lamina propria or muscularis mucosa (category 5.1, also referred to as intramucosal cancer) or into the submucosa (category 5.2, also referred to as submucosal cancer).</p><p>Another problem with the diagnosis of dysplasia in Barrett's epithelium is the interobserver reliability among pathologists. As a result, it is helpful to achieve a consensus (ie, from more than one pathologist) in categorizing such specimens. A consensus diagnosis has better predictive value regarding prognosis and may revise the original diagnosis, which can have implications for subsequent management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. These observations underlie the recommendation that a second, experienced pathologist should confirm the diagnosis of HGD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients diagnosed with HGD or early cancer in BE should undergo an endoscopic work-up in a center with expertise in evaluating such patients. The reasons for this are threefold:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation at a specialized center helps assure that a second, experienced endoscopist can confirm the findings of the initial endoscopy, making a false positive diagnosis less likely. Up to 40 percent of patients who are diagnosed with HGD have no dysplasia at follow-up endoscopies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If the diagnosis of HGD is confirmed in biopsies obtained on a separate occasion, the chance of over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment should be reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation at a specialized center permits detection of synchronous lesions elsewhere in the BE that might otherwise be left untreated. This is especially important if endoscopic therapy is being considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specialized centers often have integrated expertise in gastrointestinal pathology, endoscopy, and surgery, and the experience to offer advanced endoscopic techniques such as ER.</p><p/><p>Early neoplastic lesions in BE are often difficult to detect with standard video endoscopy. Although a number of techniques have been proposed to increase the accuracy of endoscopic imaging (such as chromoendoscopy, magnification endoscopy, and optical coherence tomography), none is used routinely in clinical practice.

Because early BE neoplasia often presents as flat lesions with only subtle mucosal abnormalities, most experts agree that high-resolution endoscopy is the preferred method for the endoscopic evaluation of BE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Have a vigilant eye</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 80 percent of patients referred for evaluation of HGD or early cancer without visible abnormalities will have at least one visible abnormality detected in their BE upon endoscopic inspection by expert endoscopists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>]. Although early BE neoplasia generally presents as subtle, flat lesions that can be difficult to detect, most state-of-the-art endoscopes are capable of revealing these abnormalities when viewed by highly experienced endoscopists. Thus, familiarity with the endoscopic appearance of early Barrett's neoplasia is essential for its diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Perform a systematic endoscopic inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The detection of gross mucosal abnormalities such as elevations, ulcerations, and nodularities is relatively easy. By comparison, the detection of subtle abnormalities requires a more careful and thorough inspection, making a systematic approach imperative.</p><p>After intubation of the esophagus, the esophagus should be carefully cleaned to remove any mucus or saliva. Simple water flushes usually are sufficient, but spraying <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetylcysteine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetylcysteine</a> (1 percent) can be helpful if there is excessive or viscous mucus. It is important to suction all gastric secretions to prevent reflux into the esophagus that could interfere with inspection.</p><p>The endoscope should be gradually withdrawn to examine the BE segment for mucosal irregularities and to describe the extent of BE. One system for doing so uses the validated Prague C &amp; M criteria, which assess the circumferential and maximum extent of the visualized BE segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. After initial inspection, the inflated esophagus should be gradually deflated to reveal any irregularities that may have flattened during inflation, making them more difficult to see. Special attention should be paid to the area between 12 and 6 o'clock in the endoscopic view, where the majority of neoplastic lesions are found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, if a hiatal hernia is present, it is important to inspect the transition of the BE into the hiatal hernia in the retroflexed position since abnormalities in this area are easily overlooked in the antegrade view.</p><p>The Seattle biopsy protocol is recommended for mapping BE with HGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Targeted biopsies are obtained from all visible abnormalities, and random four-quadrant biopsies are taken every 1 cm starting from the top of the gastric folds up to the most proximal extent of the BE (squamocolumnar junction).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The importance of random biopsies every 1 cm rather than every 2 cm was demonstrated in a study in 45 patients with BE and HGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The authors calculated that using a standard protocol would have missed 50 percent of cancers that were detected by the 1 cm protocol.</p><p/><p>Based upon the above observations, inspection and classification of all visible lesions should be followed by biopsies from each visible abnormality and then random four-quadrant biopsies. The biopsies should always start distally, working upwards to minimize bleeding that obscures visualization. We follow the rule &quot;look longer, biopsy less&quot; since, in our experience, the diagnosis of HGD or early cancer can be made in 80 to 90 percent of patients with these lesions by targeted biopsies after a thorough inspection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, random four-quadrant biopsies are still required since 10 to 20 percent of lesions are missed with targeted biopsies alone.</p><p>In addition, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) has issued guidelines that recommend ER for the treatment and staging of nodular BE and suspected intramucosal adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20326286\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic resection as staging procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We consider ER to be both a reasonable treatment option and also the final step in the diagnostic work-up of patients with HGD or early cancer in BE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. In one study, interobserver agreement about the presence of neoplasia was significantly better on ER specimens than biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This approach is consistent with 2013 guidelines from the ASGE that recommend ER for the treatment and staging of nodular BE and suspected intramucosal adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

However, EUS is less reliable for T- and N-staging in patients with HGD and early cancer than in patients with more advanced esophageal cancer. In addition, accuracy is influenced by the experience of the endosonographer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

The target lesion is first lifted by injection of a fluid, which may be saline or diluted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (1:100,000), into the submucosal layer. Subsequently, a transparent cap is attached to the endoscope. The cap has a distal ridge that allows positioning of a crescent-shaped ER-snare. The lesion is sucked into the cap, thus creating a pseudopolyp that is immediately captured by forcefully closing the pre-positioned ER-snare. The lesion is then removed using electrocoagulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ER-caps are available with different diameters and have either a straight or an oblique shape. The largest en bloc resections are achieved with a large caliber flexible cap that, despite its large outer diameter of 18 mm, can be relatively easily introduced into the esophagus due to its flexibility. Using this technique, lesions with a diameter of more than 2 cm can be removed en bloc.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Multiband mucosectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiband mucosectomy (MBM) uses a modified variceal band ligator with six bands and a handle that allows passage of a hexagonal snare alongside the releasing wires for the bands. Suction is used to draw the lesion into the cap, a rubber band is deployed, and a polypoid lesion is created. The &quot;polyp&quot; can then be removed using a snare that is inserted through the biopsy channel. Multiple specimens can be removed during the procedure using this device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53386\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53386 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p>This MBM technique has several advantages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a modification of the &quot;suck-band-and-ligate&quot; technique, it does not require submucosal injection as with the ER-cap technique. The reason is that the esophageal muscle layer will immediately retract when captured within a rubber band, whereas with the standard ER-cap technique it will remain captured in the forcefully closed ER-snare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple resections can be performed with the same snare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-looping the ER-snare in the ridge of the cap is not necessary. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MBM does not require withdrawal of the endoscope between resections as is needed with the &quot;conventional&quot; suck-band-and-ligate technique. Since the instrument holds six rubber bands, up to six consecutive resections can be performed. This reduces the time and cost required for the procedure while also reducing patient discomfort.</p><p/><p>A prospective<strong> </strong>registration of 243 MBM procedures in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) demonstrated that the technique is safe and effective. Complications occurring during the procedure (acute complications) were observed in 3 percent. Bleeding was the only acute complication, and in all cases it was managed endoscopically. No perforations occurred. Complications within 30 days of the procedure (early complications) included delayed bleeding (2 percent of procedures) that was managed endoscopically and stenosis (48 percent).

The study showed that MBM was safe and effective for widespread ER in BE. MBM appeared to be quicker than ER-cap, but the specimens removed with MBM were significantly smaller than with the ER-cap technique.</p><p>Following this case-control study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial was initiated to compare the ER-cap technique and MBM for piecemeal resection of early neoplasia in BE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The trial included 84 patients (42 assigned to MBM and 42 to ER-cap) and found that procedure times and costs were significantly less with MBM versus ER-cap (34 versus 50 minutes and 240 versus 322 euro, respectively). MBM resulted in smaller specimens than ER-cap (18 versus 20 mm in longest dimension). There were no significant differences in maximum specimen thickness or the amount of submucosa resected. There were three perforations in the ER-cap group and one perforation in the MBM group. The perforations in the ER-cap group were treated endoscopically, whereas the perforation in the MBM group required surgical repair because of periesophageal scarring that prevented endoscopic closure.</p><p>MBM appears to be safe and fast for widespread ER in BE. Time and costs appear to be saved compared with ER-cap since submucosal lifting is not required and a single snare can be used for all resections. MBM does not appear to be associated with more complications than ER-cap despite the lack of submucosal lifting. MBM results in significantly smaller-sized resections, but the clinical relevance of this finding may be questioned since there was no significant difference in the depth of resection between the two techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic submucosal dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopists have used specially designed needle knives for en bloc dissection of large esophageal lesions, a technique known as endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>]. The main advantage of ESD is that it allows for en bloc resection of lesions, but it is associated with a longer procedure time and a higher risk of complications compared with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). A randomized trial comparing ESD (n = 20) with EMR (n = 20) for patients with BE with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or early adenocarcinoma demonstrated a higher radical resection rate after ESD (10 of 17 versus 2 of 17; p = 0.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, there appeared to be few clinical benefits from the higher radical resection rate; there was no difference in complete remission from neoplasia at three months (15 of 16 for ESD versus 16 of 17 for EMR) and, during a mean follow-up period of 23 months, recurrent early adenocarcinoma was observed in one patient in the ESD group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In addition, ESD was associated with a perforation in two patients and a significantly longer procedure time (mean 54 versus 22 minutes; p = 0.0002). </p><p>The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines recommend piecemeal EMR over ESD in most cases of Barrett's early neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. We reserve ESD for patients with a strong suspicion of submucosal invasion and for the resection of lesions with a large intraluminal component prohibiting a cap-based resection (ie, the intraluminal part of the lesion would fill the cap upon suctioning, and resection of the basal mucosal layers might be incomplete despite the absence of deep submucosal invasion). We perform ESD for less than 10 percent of all early Barrett's neoplasia cases.

The training program of six teams (consisting of an endoscopist, an endoscopy nurse, and a pathologist) is aimed at controlled implementation and centralization of ER procedures in the Netherlands. Training resulted in a high success rate of complete ER of lesions, although the observed perforation rate of 5 percent suggested that performing 20 ER procedures is insufficient to reach the peak of the learning curve in ER for a single endoscopist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>ER should only be performed by trained endoscopists with experience in screening, imaging, and treatment of patients with early Barrett's neoplasia.

The tissue architecture with crypts and villi differs from the layered architecture in squamous mucosa, making it more difficult to discern a clear transition between wall layers. This problem is further increased by the presence of a double muscularis mucosae in many patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Because the deeper muscle layer represents the true muscularis mucosae, lesions infiltrating through the superficial muscularis mucosae should <strong>not</strong> be considered as submucosal invading cancers.</p><p>Many early lesions in BE are associated with severe inflammation that is due to the accompanying reflux disease and may hamper histological assessment. Similarly, because ER involves the use of electrocoagulation, the deep and especially the lateral resection margins may have coagulation artifacts, complicating histologic evaluation compared with surgical resection specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The ability to treat early cancer with ER underscores the important nuances of histopathologic assessment. However, making important distinctions between high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and invasive cancer (and its depth of invasion) may not be straightforward. In an illustrative report, the interobserver reliability for distinguishing BE with HGD from intramucosal cancer in surgical specimens was poor (kappa statistic 0.42) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. It was somewhat better for distinguishing intramucosal and submucosal cancer (kappa statistic of 0.71). Currently, the distinction between HGD and mucosal cancer is not considered clinically relevant. The two conditions are difficult to distinguish histologically, and both carry a virtually absent risk of local lymph node metastases. For clinical decision-making, the distinction between mucosal cancer and submucosal cancer is much more relevant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic subclassification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terminology and classification of early esophageal cancers have evolved and are outlined in the 2010 tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system of the combined American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for international Cancer Control (UICC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Early esophageal cancers are those that are classified as Tis (HGD, which includes all noninvasive neoplastic epithelial that was formerly called carcinoma in situ) or T1 tumors.

However, this classification by itself is inadequate to distinguish differences in lymph node involvement among T1a and T1b esophageal cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer&quot;, section on 'TNM staging criteria'</a>.)</p><p>A more comprehensive subclassification scheme has been proposed for early esophageal cancers and is useful for determining prognosis and selecting treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

There is less consensus, however, with regard to lesions that extend to the muscularis mucosa (M3 tumors), yet most centers consider this an accepted indication for endoscopic treatment of early Barrett's neoplasia, whereas for squamous neoplasia M3 lesions are a relative indication.</p><p>Esophagectomy is generally preferred for lesions that invade the submucosa (SM1, SM2, and SM3 tumors) given the significantly higher rates of lymph node metastasis associated with these lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59638\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59638 \">table 2</a>). Studies have suggested that ER may be appropriate for lesions that penetrate into the superficial submucosal (SM1 tumors with submucosal penetration &lt;500 microns). The reason ER may be an option is that these lesions may have a low risk of positive lymph nodes, provided that they do not show poorly differentiated cancer or lymphovascular invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].

Complete eradication of all neoplasia (CE-neo) and all intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) at the end of the treatment phase was similar in both groups (CE-neo 100 versus 96 percent, and CE-IM 92 versus 96 percent, respectively). The stenosis rate was higher in the SRER group than in the ER plus RFA group (88 versus 14 percent), which resulted in significantly more therapeutic sessions in the SRER group (six versus three procedures), mainly due to dilations. After a median follow-up of 24 months (interquartile range 18 to 29 months), a single patient in the SRER group had a recurrent cancer at the neosquamocolumnar junction, which could be removed with ER [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p/><p>The role of the SRER technique seems limited to select patients in the treatment of HGD or EC in BE.

ER should only be performed by trained endoscopists with experience in screening, imaging, and treatment of patients with early Barrett's neoplasia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for eligibility'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20326359\" class=\"local\">'Learning curve'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ER is particularly useful in patients with nodular lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ER aids in histopathologic diagnosis since it permits assessment of depth of infiltration and estimation of the risk for local lymph node metastasis. However, histopathologic interpretation of ER specimens may not be straightforward. (See <a href=\"#H20326286\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic resection as staging procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with HGD or early cancer should be referred to specialized centers that have integrated expertise in gastrointestinal endoscopy, imaging, surgery, and histopathology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients treated with ER require regular follow-up to detect recurrent lesions. In most studies, patients are followed every three months during the first year and annually thereafter. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal techniques for performing ER alone or in conjunction with other endoscopic approaches are evolving. Combined with radiofrequency ablation, excellent eradication rates have been reported. Stepwise radical ER is associated with a higher rate of stenosis, and its use should be limited to patients with more extensive lesions. (See <a href=\"#H20326484\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic resection as part of endoscopic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common complications from ER are bleeding and esophageal stricture formation, both of which can generally be addressed endoscopically.
