An initial survey of seven nephrology centers in Brussels identified 14 women under the age of 50 years who had presented with advanced renal failure due to biopsy-proven chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis over a three-year period; nine of these patients had been exposed to the same slimming regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A total of more than 300 cases have been identified, a third of whom have already undergone renal transplantation.</p><p>The epidemiology is unknown, as is the risk for development of severe renal damage. However, the publication of case reports from several countries in Europe and Asia, particularly in China, indicate that the incidence of herbal medicine-induced nephrotoxicity is more common than previously thought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major lesion, which is located principally in the cortex, is extensive interstitial fibrosis with atrophy and loss of the tubules. Cellular infiltration of the interstitium is scarce. Thickening of the walls of the interlobular and afferent arterioles results from endothelial cell swelling. The glomeruli are relatively spared, and immune deposits are not observed. These findings suggest that the primary lesions may be centered in the vessel walls, thereby leading to ischemia and interstitial fibrosis.</p><p>An extremely high incidence of cellular atypia and urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the renal pelvis, ureter, and bladder has been associated with AA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AA nephropathy is caused by exposure to AA, a family of compounds found in the plant genus&nbsp;Aristolochiaceae, including the&nbsp;<em>Aristolochia</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Asarum</em>&nbsp;species (also known as birthwort or Dutchman&rsquo;s pipe). AA also causes urothelial malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and was classified a human (class I) carcinogen by the World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer.</p><p>Support for AA as the major nephrotoxin is provided by findings in animal models (rabbit, rat, and mice) of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. In one study, for example, rabbits were given intraperitoneal injections of AA (0.1 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">AA/kg</span> five days a week for 17 to 21 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Histologic examination of the kidneys and genitourinary tract revealed renal hypocellular interstitial fibrosis and atypical and malignant uroepithelial cells.</p><p>However, it is not clear if AA has been part of the herbal preparations used by all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, AA (0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/tablet)</span> has been used as an immunomodulatory drug for 20 years in Germany by thousands of patients, sometimes in doses comparable with that found in AA-containing slimming regimens; despite this exposure, there is no report relating chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis to AA in Germany.</p><p>The necessity to stimulate the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (salt deprivation) to obtain fibro-interstitial lesions is consistent with the combined exposure concept observed with several potential nephrotoxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, however, does not prevent renal interstitial fibrosis by AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. How far transdifferentiation and apoptosis play an important role in this fast-developing type of chronic tubulointerstitial disease of the kidneys is still not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One study suggests that AA induces tubular epithelial cell death via apoptosis by dephosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and posttranslational activation of p53, supporting the hypothesis that p53 promotes renal injury in AA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Another uncertain factor is why only some patients exposed to the same herbal preparations develop renal disease. Women appear to be at greater risk than men. Other possibly important factors include toxin dose, batch-to-batch variability in toxin content, individual differences in toxin metabolism, and a genetically determined predisposition toward nephrotoxicity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> carcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In one of the two studies showing a link between AA and carcinogenesis, an increased dose of AA was associated with an enhanced risk of carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Tissue samples revealed AA-related DNA adducts, indicating a possible mechanism underlying the development of malignancy. The presence of these adducts was noted in another report of two patients with urothelial malignancy and AA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The demonstration of AA-derived DNA adducts in renal cortical and urothelial tumor tissue of patients with documented Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) associated with the dominance of the A:T<em>&rarr;</em>T:A transversions in the p53 tumor suppressor gene mutational spectrum helped identify AA as an etiological agent of the upper tract malignancy spectra in urothelial cancers among BEN patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In addition, molecular epidemiological evidence associated urothelial-cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract to dietary exposure to AA through the contamination of flour prepared from locally grown wheat grain in the endemic cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In this study, aristolactam-DNA adducts were present in 70 percent of the endemic cohort (n = 67) and in 94 percent of subjects with A:T<em>&rarr;</em>T:A mutations in <em>TP53</em>. In contrast, neither aristolactam-DNA adducts nor A:T<em>&rarr;</em>T:A mutations were detected in tumors of upper urinary tract carcinoma patients (n =10) residing in nonendemic regions (ie, regions not exposed to AA). The authors proposed a molecular epidemiological approach using deoxyadenosine-aristolactam adducts and <em>TP53 </em>mutational spectra as biomarkers of exposure to and carcinogenic effects of AA in the evaluation of the disease in countries where <em>Aristolochia </em>species have been used for medicinal purposes.</p><p>The etiology of herbal medicine-induced nephrotoxicity and BEN is exposure to AA, a toxic component of all <em>Aristolochia </em>species. The slower progression toward end-stage renal disease (ESRD) of patients with BEN has to do with lower doses of AA ingested during the consumption of contaminated bread as compared with the high dose of AA found in the herbal mixtures used by patients in the &quot;slimming&quot; clinic. The higher prevalence of women in the herbal medicine-induced nephrotoxicity cohorts can be attributed to the fact that young women are more likely to attend such clinics. The exact mechanism, however, by which exposure to AA results in chronic renal damage remains uncertain.</p><p>In a study in mice, chronic administration of AA resulted in progressive renal damage. AA activated Smad signaling, mediating epithelial&ndash;mesenchymal transition and renal fibrosis via both transforming growth factor-beta-dependent and <span class=\"nowrap\">JNK/MAP</span> kinase-dependent mechanisms. The blockade of JNK and specific knock-down of Smad3, but not Smad2, were able to attenuate AA-stimulated collagen matrix expression and epithelial&ndash;mesenchymal transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. AA was shown to be involved in the early proximal tubular dysfunction, manifested by low-molecular-weight proteinuria, as is found in herbal medicine-induced nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A causal relationship was proposed among DNA adduct formation, decreased megalin expression, and inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis of low-molecular-weight proteinuria.</p><p>In acute AA nephropathy in mice, AA adducts formed with DNA were associated with tubular epithelial cell apoptosis via p53-mediated signaling. AA induced dephosphorylation of STAT3 with subsequent activation of p53 and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis.</p><p>In contrast, overexpression of STAT3, p53 inhibition, or p53 knock-down with small interfering RNA attenuated AA-induced tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. This supports the hypothesis that p53 promotes renal injury in acute AA nephropathy. These results have to be interpreted with caution with regard to humans in view of the slowly progressive character of the disease in patients. On the other hand, experiments conducted on tissue from patients with BEN indicate that p53 is also activated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Affected patients typically present with renal insufficiency, with other findings that are typical of a primary tubulointerstitial disease. The blood pressure is either normal or only mildly elevated, protein excretion is only moderately increased (less than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> and the urine sediment reveals only a few red and white cells. The elevation in protein excretion consists of both albumin and low-molecular-weight proteins that are normally filtered and reabsorbed by proximal tubular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, tubular dysfunction contributes to the proteinuria.</p><p>The plasma creatinine concentration at presentation has ranged from 1.4 to 12.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (123 to 1122 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Renal function tends to decline more rapidly than in other forms of interstitial nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As an example, in one study, among patients with AA nephropathy, compared with a control group of patients of similar age range and baseline serum creatinine, the creatinine doubling time was shorter (13 versus 52 months, respectively), and the two-year renal survival time was worse (17 versus 74 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, most patients who present with an initial plasma creatinine concentration below 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (176 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> appear to have relatively stable renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Progressive renal failure resulting in eventual dialysis or transplantation may ensue in patients with more severe disease, even if further exposure to AA is prevented. The risk for progressive disease increases with the duration of exposure.</p><p>An extremely similar clinical and pathologic process has been reported in a group of patients from Taiwan who had ingested a selection of uncontrolled traditional AA that differed from those of the slimming regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Despite discontinuation of these remedies, progressive renal failure was common. Although the exact correlation between this disorder and traditional AA nephropathy associated with the slimming regimen is unclear, toxins common to different herbal remedies may cause interstitial renal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no proven, effective therapy for this disorder, which typically presents with marked interstitial fibrosis, but not prominent inflammation.

Whether more aggressive management strategies, such as bilateral native nephroureterectomies (particularly in those undergoing renal transplantation), are required is unclear. Findings from one report support the more aggressive option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephropathy-induced-by-aristolochic-acid-aa-containing-herbs/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Renal transplantation is an effective modality for those who progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
