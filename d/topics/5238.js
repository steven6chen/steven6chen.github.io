The approach to making the diagnosis should consist of obtaining one or more definitive diagnostic tests in combination with serologic testing. Depending on the patient's clinical presentation, tests used to make a definitive diagnostic tests may include culture of a tissue or blood sample, <em>Bartonella</em> polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on a tissue or blood sample, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tissue biopsy with histopathologic examination and appropriate staining. </p><p>A positive result from more than one type of definitive test provides the strongest evidence for a diagnosis of <em>Bartonella</em> infection. However, since each of the definitive tests has limitations, serologic testing for <em>Bartonella</em> is often used as supportive evidence for infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28105036\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Bartonella</em> species are fastidious gram-negative bacteria that require specific laboratory conditions to enhance the yield. The likelihood of isolating of the organism from blood increases if the blood sample is collected in pediatric or adult isolator tubes (Wampole, Cranbury, New Jersey), or in tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). <em>Bartonella</em> species have occasionally been isolated from BACTEC (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Instrument Systems, Sparks, Maryland) bottles.</p><p>Plating blood or tissue samples onto either chocolate agar or heart infusion agar supplemented with 5 percent rabbit blood enhances the yield of isolating organisms in subcultures. Optimally, the microbiology lab should use fresh agar plates and incubate them in 5 percent CO<sub>2</sub> at 35 to 37&ordm;C for a minimum of 21 days. Isolation of <em>Bartonella</em> from tissue samples remains very difficult, but some have successfully accomplished this by directly plating tissue homogenates onto agar and cocultivating with a bovine endothelial cell monolayer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1386672616\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of PCR-based tests have increasingly played an important role in the diagnosis of <em>Bartonella</em>-associated infections, especially since isolating <em>Bartonella</em> species from blood or tissue samples is very difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. For patients with suspected bacteremia, <em>Bartonella</em> PCR testing can be performed on whole blood, plasma, or serum samples. Qualitative <em>Bartonella</em> PCR testing on tissue or blood is available commercially through several laboratories, but not all of the laboratories offer a PCR test that differentiates <em>Bartonella</em> <em>quintana</em> from <em>Bartonella</em> <em>henselae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28105043\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard hematoxylin and eosin staining of bacillary angiomatosis (BA) lesions from any site characteristically shows lobular vascular proliferations composed of rounded vessels lined by variably protuberant plump endothelial cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54383\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54383 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

It is not clear whether HIV-infected patients develop antibodies to the <em>Bartonella</em> organisms in the same fashion as immunocompetent individuals. In one <em>Bartonella</em> serology study that involved injection drug users in Baltimore, HIV infection and low CD4 counts were associated with a decreased probability of seropositivity to <em>Bartonella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Although both the IFA and EIA serologic tests have undergone study, most commercially available assays use the IFA test, and most offer testing for both IgM and IgG. The <em>Bartonella</em> IFA tests report separate results for <em>B</em>. <em>quintana</em> and<em> B</em>. <em>henselae</em>, but the significant cross-reactivity limits the value of species specific results.</p><p>In general, IFA IgG titers &lt;1:64 suggest the patient does not have a current <em>Bartonella</em> infection, but up to 25 percent of HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression may never develop a positive serologic test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Titers &lt;1:64 could represent past infection. Titers &gt;1:64 but &lt;1:256 represent possible <em>Bartonella</em> infection, and repeat testing in 10 to 14 days is generally recommended. Titers &gt;1:256 strongly suggest active or recent infection.</p><p>Since data about <em>Bartonella</em> serologic testing in HIV-infected patients are sparse, these tests should not stand alone as a means to diagnose <em>Bartonella</em> infections. A positive serology can be used as supportive information in the appropriate clinical setting. However, a convincing diagnosis of <em>Bartonella</em> infection in HIV-infected patients generally requires a positive culture or PCR test, or a biopsy showing histopathologic findings consistent with <em>Bartonella</em> infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28105064\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All HIV-infected individuals diagnosed with <em>Bartonella</em> infection should receive antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>].

When selecting a regimen, it is important to assess for drug interactions, particularly if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> is used.

We agree with guidelines that suggest deferring ART two to four weeks after starting antimicrobial treatment for <em>Bartonella</em> in patients who have central nervous system or ophthalmic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The rationale for this approach is based on a theoretical concern that an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) could lead to serious complications. Although there are no reports describing IRIS in patients with <em>Bartonella</em> infection, poor clinical outcomes related to IRIS have been demonstrated in patients with other opportunistic infections that affect the central nervous system and the eye, such as cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis&quot;, section on 'CMV immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients#H10923597\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Toxoplasmosis and immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS)'</a>.) </p><p>We do not delay the initiation of ART in patients presenting with other manifestations of <em>Bartonella</em> (eg, skin lesions, endocarditis) since the risks associated with an IRIS-like syndrome would be less severe in these conditions.
