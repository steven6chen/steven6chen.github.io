The use of a trephine biopsy for all patients is controversial. A trephine biopsy is required if the marrow is inaspirable and may add useful diagnostic information above that obtained from a bone marrow aspiration alone in other patients. This sample should be sent for pathologic review, immunophenotyping, cytochemistry, and cytogenetics. Mutation analysis for <em>CEBPA, FLT3, TP53, RUNX1, ASXL1, <span class=\"nowrap\">IDH1/2,</span> </em>and<em> NPM1</em> mutations should be performed, if available, even if they were performed at the time of initial diagnosis since they may have changed at the time of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. These mutations provide prognostic information and may identify targets for novel agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F111588\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111588 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Gene mutations'</a>.) </p><p>Once relapsed or refractory disease is identified, further evaluation should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An assessment of performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 4</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing should be performed for patients who are candidates for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). If no sibling donor can be identified, an alternative donor search (including unrelated volunteer donors and cord blood stem cells) should be initiated. This is extremely important since HCT is the most likely method for curing patients with relapsed AML. (See <a href=\"#H70422874\" class=\"local\">'Determining transplant eligibility'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, albumin and total protein, serum lysozyme, and serology for hepatitis B, HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. An elevation in serum or urinary lysozyme levels may explain renal dysfunction in monocytic and myelomonocytic leukemia. Women of childbearing age should undergo a pregnancy test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest x-ray, pulmonary function tests, an electrocardiogram (EKG) and a study of cardiac function (eg, ejection fraction measured by echocardiogram or MUGA) should be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dental evaluation with x-rays for possible infection foci is warranted. CT scans of the sinuses and chest may detect clinically occult sites of infection, although the yield in asymptomatic patients is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with neurologic signs or symptoms should undergo imaging studies to evaluate for meningeal disease, or central nervous system bleeding. Lumbar puncture is indicated in patients with neurologic signs or symptoms to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for leukemic involvement. Care must be taken to avoid contaminating the CSF specimen with peripheral blood if blasts were present. CSF should be sent for both cytology (examination of stained cytospin slides) and flow cytometry for detection of AML blasts.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261041554\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTION OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapy that provides the best chance to cure a patient with relapsed or refractory AML is an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The best outcomes appear to be with myeloablative preparative regimens administered after attaining a complete remission (CR). However, some patients may be cured with myeloablative HCT despite residual disease at the time of HCT. In addition, nonmyeloablative preparative regimens may be considered for patients who are not candidates for myeloablative HCT, but have attained a CR. Autologous marrow transplantation is an option for those patients who achieve a second CR. A physician who specializes in transplantation should be consulted at the time relapsed or refractory disease is identified to help guide this decision process. </p><p>The decision of whether to attempt a second remission induction prior to HCT depends upon several factors, such as age, comorbidities, duration of first remission, cytogenetic features, access to an experienced transplant center, resources for home care, and of course, the patient's own wishes. Important questions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How likely is the patient to attain a CR? Patients who undergo HCT in CR appear to have better outcomes. Patients who previously attained a CR that lasted longer than six months have a greater than 50 percent chance of attaining a second CR with further chemotherapy. In contrast, of patients with initially refractory disease and those with an initial CR lasting less than six months, 20 percent or fewer will attain a second CR with chemotherapy alone. (See <a href=\"#H21583133\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic indices'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is an HLA-matched donor immediately available? If a matched donor is not available for immediate collection, chemotherapy administered in the attempt to achieve a CR may control the disease while a search for a compatible donor is undertaken. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient a candidate for a myeloablative preparative regimen? Myeloablative HCT eradicates tumor cells through both a direct cytotoxic effect and a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. In contrast, nonmyeloablative preparative regimens rely in large part upon an immunological GVL effect alone. Nonmyeloablative HCT is not appropriate for patients with refractory or rapidly progressive AML because it can take several months for a GVL effect to develop post-transplant. (See <a href=\"#H2094351828\" class=\"local\">'Nonmyeloablative (reduced intensity) HCT'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How did the patient tolerate induction therapy before? Attempts at a second induction may result in toxicity that limits the ability to proceed with a potentially curative HCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have active infections (ie, aspergillosis) that are associated with a high mortality rate at HCT? (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-for-infection-before-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation for infection before hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>There have been no randomized trials of HCT preceded or not by chemotherapy administered in an attempt at inducing a second remission; as such, clinical practice varies. HCT outcomes are better if no detectable leukemia is present at the time of transplantation. </p><p>Some experts choose to administer or not administer re-induction chemotherapy prior to myeloablative HCT based upon the likelihood of achieving a second CR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. With this approach, a young patient who had an initial prolonged CR may be given further chemotherapy prior to HCT because more than half of such patients would be expected to attain a second CR. In contrast, further chemotherapy may be deferred for a patient with an initial CR lasting less than six months since it may only prove to worsen the functional status and decrease the chance of a successful HCT. Instead, it may be reasonable to proceed to HCT without prior chemotherapy if the patient is a good candidate for a myeloablative HCT and a donor is available. If the patient is not a candidate for a myeloablative HCT, then a CR should be attained prior to nonmyeloablative HCT. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Myeloablative HCT'</a> below.) </p><p>A pretransplant scoring system has been devised to predict the survival of patients not in CR who undergo myeloablative HCT based upon the assessment of five criteria (maximum score 6 points) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of CR: First CR &le;6 months = 1 point</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytogenetics prior to HCT: Poor risk = 1 point</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donor: Mismatched unrelated donor = 1 point; related donor other than HLA identical sibling = 2 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circulating blasts: Present = 1 point</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Karnofsky performance status: &lt;90 = 1 point</p><p/><p>Total score predicted long-term survival when applied to 1673 patients with relapsed or refractory AML not in CR at the time of myeloablative HCT. Rates of three-year overall survival were 42, 28, 15, and 6 percent for patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3 points, respectively. Given these data, some clinicians may choose to proceed with myeloablative HCT without further induction chemotherapy if the patient has a score &le;2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For patients with a score of &ge;3, myeloablative HCT is unlikely to be of benefit; further induction chemotherapy may be administered to these patients in an attempt to decrease the tumor burden and improve the performance status prior to reconsideration of HCT. Alternatively, such patients may be considered for a clinical trial of an investigational agent. (See <a href=\"#H70421931\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">REMISSION RE-INDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, not all patients will require remission induction therapy prior to myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, all patients undergoing a <strong>non</strong>myeloablative HCT should undergo re-induction therapy with the goal of achieving complete remission (CR) prior to HCT. Consultation with a physician who specializes in HCT can help with the decision process. </p><p>Remission induction therapy for relapsed or refractory AML generally utilizes intensive chemotherapy; such intensive therapy may not be suitable for older or frail individuals.</p><p>For patients whose relapsed or refractory AML has a mutation of <em>IDH2</em> (isocitrate dehydrogenase-2), treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enasidenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enasidenib</a> is an acceptable alternative to intensive chemotherapy. Enasidenib is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of relapsed or refractory AML with an <em>IDH2</em> mutation (eg, detected by the companion diagnostic, the RealTime IDH2 Assay) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Prescribing information includes a boxed warning and instructions on the risk of differentiation syndrome and need for prompt intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiation (retinoic acid) syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approval was based on a multicenter trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enasidenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enasidenib</a> (100 mg daily by mouth) in 176 adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML with an <em>IDH2</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. After a median follow-up of 10 months, the following findings were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall response rate was 40 percent (nine month median survival and six month median duration of response), including CR in 19 percent (20 month median survival).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Responses were associated with differentiation of myeloblasts rather than bone marrow aplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; median time to first response was two months and one-third of CRs were not achieved until &ge;5 months of treatment. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differentiation syndrome (akin to that associated with treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a>) was reported as grade 3 to 4 in &lt;10 percent of patients, but two deaths may have resulted from this condition; careful monitoring and prompt intervention is required, as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiation (retinoic acid) syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other severe (grade 3 to 4) treatment-related adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;20 percent of patients included elevated bilirubin and nausea, but severe hematologic toxicities and infections occurred in 10 percent and 1 percent of patients, respectively. </p><p/><p>Patients who are not candidates for a myeloablative HCT whose relapsed AML demonstrates a highly unfavorable genotype (eg, monosomal karyotype) are unlikely to respond to standard chemotherapy regimens and should be considered for investigational agents. (See <a href=\"#H70421931\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below.)</p><p>A number of chemotherapy regimens have been used for patients with resistant or relapsed disease. Many of these combinations are dose-intensive and cannot easily be applied in older patients. Since these regimens have not been directly compared, a choice is primarily based upon clinical experience. Although response rates are presented for some of these regimens, an individual's chance of responding to a particular regimen is influenced not only by prior exposure to chemotherapy but also by other patient- and leukemia-associated factors. In theory, the preferred regimen would exclude agents at dose levels for salvage which the patient has been exposed to recently. (See <a href=\"#H21583133\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic indices'</a> below.)</p><p>While treatment centers and clinicians may have a preferred approach, there is no regimen that stands out as clearly more beneficial than another. This was illustrated in an international randomized phase III study of elacytarabine versus investigator choice in 381 patients with relapsed or refractory AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In the control arm, investigators were able to choose among seven regimens prior to randomization. When compared with other therapies, elacytarabine provided no additional benefit in terms of overall survival (3.5 months), response rate (23 percent), or relapse-free survival (5 months). Importantly, there was no evidence in favor of any of the variations of chemotherapy schedules in the control arm. The only long-term survivors were the few patients who achieved a response and proceeded with allogeneic HCT. This supports our aim to administer the quickest and least toxic regimen to induce cytoreduction and allow the patient to proceed to an allogeneic HCT quickly and in good physical shape.</p><p>The most commonly used regimens are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82823\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82823 \">table 5</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> (HiDAC; eg, 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> every 12 hours for 8 to 12 doses) may be effective in 35 to 40 percent of patients resistant to conventional dose cytarabine regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. If HiDAC was used in the initial induction therapy, an alternative regimen should be selected. An anthracycline (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daunorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daunorubicin</a>) may be added if it was not used during initial induction, or if the cumulative anthracycline dose would not exceed that likely to be associated with cardiotoxicity.

Ongoing studies are evaluating novel approaches to induce graft-versus-tumor activity and decrease graft-versus-host disease in recipients of haploidentical grafts. As with nonmyeloablative HCT and cord blood HCT, successful outcomes are largely dependent upon the attainment of a CR prior to HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. Experimental approaches have also combined cord blood transplantation with infusion of CD34+ selected stem cells from a haploidentical family member [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>].
