However, up to 50 percent of young, healthy couples that fail to conceive in the first 12 months will conceive in the subsequent 12 months with no specific treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-male-with-infertility/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, in some circumstances, delay in extensive evaluation and treatment is reasonable. In approximately 35 percent of couples with infertility, a male factor is identified along with a female factor; in approximately 10 percent, a male factor is the only identifiable cause.</p><p>While many men with male infertility have oligozoospermia (a low number of sperm cells in the ejaculate compared with reference ranges) or azoospermia (no sperm cells in the ejaculate), some infertile men have normal sperm counts. Over 80 percent of infertile men have low sperm concentrations associated with a decrease in sperm motility (asthenozoospermia) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an increase in spermatozoa with abnormal morphology (teratozoospermia). A small percentage of infertile men have normal sperm concentrations but poor sperm quality, reflected by a decrease in sperm motility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormal sperm morphology, and another small percentage of infertile men have normal sperm concentrations and normal motility and morphology.</p><p>This topic will review the evaluation of male infertility. The causes and management of male infertility and an overview of infertility are reviewed separately.

Idiopathic male infertility should be distinguished from idiopathic dysspermatogenesis. Idiopathic male infertility describes an infertile man with a normal semen analysis and no apparent cause for infertility, whereas infertile men with idiopathic dysspermatogenesis have abnormal semen analyses.</p><p/><p>The precise epidemiology of prevalence and causes of male infertility has never been accurately assessed for several reasons, including underreporting and lack of systematic data gathering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-male-with-infertility/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The noted frequencies represent an estimate of the approximate proportion of men in each category presenting to a tertiary referral center and likely do not represent the prevalence in the broader community in industrialized countries, nor do these estimations reflect likely regional variations around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-male-with-infertility/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4168872994\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of the male with infertility is focused on detecting the small percentage of causes that can be treated to restore normal fertility. The remainder of the evaluation of male infertility is focused on determining which couples with male factor infertility might benefit from assisted reproductive technologies (ART).</p><p>Molecular biology techniques have increased the ability to identify more genetic causes of male infertility, but only a minority of infertile men have an identifiable cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-male-with-infertility/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of male infertility&quot;</a>). The disorders in many infertile men are characterized primarily by descriptions of observed abnormalities, such as decreased sperm number, movement, or egg-penetrating and fusion capabilities.

A detailed history of the female partner should also be obtained, including history of previous fertility (or infertility) and any prior evaluation or treatment. For the male partner, the clinician should inquire about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual developmental history, including testicular descent, pubertal development, loss of body hair, or decrease in shaving frequency</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic severe systemic illness and history of major head or pelvic trauma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections, such as mumps orchitis, sinopulmonary symptoms, sexually transmitted infections, and genitourinary tract infections (including prostatitis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical procedures involving the inguinal and scrotal areas, such as vasectomy or orchiectomy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs and environmental exposures, including alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, opioids, radiation therapy, anabolic steroids, corticosteroids, cytotoxic chemotherapy (current or past), drugs that cause hyperprolactinemia, and exposure to toxic chemicals (eg, pesticides)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual history, including libido, frequency of intercourse, and previous fertility assessments of the man and his partner</p><p/><p>The physical examination should include a general medical examination to determine overall health, obesity, and overt signs of endocrinopathies that are uncommon causes of male infertility (eg, thyroid dysfunction or Cushing's syndrome).</p><p>Because some infertile men have combined defects in testosterone and sperm production, the examination should also focus on findings suggestive of androgen deficiency. The clinical manifestations of androgen deficiency depend upon the age of onset. Androgen deficiency during early gestation presents as atypical genitalia; in late gestation as micropenis; in childhood as delayed pubertal development; and in adulthood as decreased sexual function, infertility, and, eventually, loss of secondary sex characteristics. The examination of the man should include the following components. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of male hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin &ndash; Men with iron overload syndromes as the cause of infertility may have diffuse or patchy hyperpigmentation. Men with Cushing's syndrome may have thin skin, ecchymoses, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> broad purple striae. Loss of pubic, axillary, and facial hair, decreased oiliness of the skin, and fine facial wrinkling suggest longstanding testosterone deficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External genitalia &ndash; Several abnormalities that affect fertility can be recognized by examination of the external genitalia:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Incomplete sexual development can be recognized by examining the phallus and testes and finding small testes and other findings of incomplete pubertal development (Tanner stage less than 5).

The Prader orchidometer consists of a series of plastic ellipsoids with a volume from 1 to 35 mL. In an adult man, a testicular volume below 15 mL or a testicular length (measured on the longest axis) less than 3.6 cm are considered small.</p><p/><p>The Prader orchidometer has been reported to estimate greater testicular volumes than those by ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-male-with-infertility/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The difference between the two methods is greater for smaller than larger volumes, eg, approximately 5 mL difference for testicular volumes 5 to 15 mL but only 1 to 3 mL for volumes 20 to 25 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-male-with-infertility/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A systematic review showed that ultrasound is more accurate than the Prader orchidometer to assess testicular volume, but the measurements by both methods are closely related, indicating that the Prader orchidometer is adequate for assessment of the infertile man in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-male-with-infertility/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2564207924\"><span class=\"h3\">Semen analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Semen analysis is the key laboratory assessment of the male partner of an infertile couple.

If possible, the patient should collect the sample by masturbation at the doctor's office. If not possible, then the sample may be collected at home and delivered to the laboratory within an hour of collection.</p><p>Because of the marked inherent variability of sperm concentrations in semen samples, <strong>at least two samples</strong> should be collected at least one week apart. The semen analysis should be performed using standardized methods, preferably those described in the World Health Organization (WHO) Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-male-with-infertility/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, the laboratory should employ internal quality control measures and participate in external quality control programs available from national andrology, clinical chemistry, and pathology societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-male-with-infertility/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3716837543\"><span class=\"h4\">Reference limits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WHO has published lower reference limits for semen analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-male-with-infertility/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].
