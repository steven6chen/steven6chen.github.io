These arrhythmias fall into two broad categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant or potentially lethal arrhythmias, including sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and VF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsustained or hemodynamically tolerated arrhythmias, including VPBs, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR). The clinical significance of these arrhythmias is largely based upon whether or not they predict future malignant arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD).</p><p/><p>The prognostic significance of VPBs and NSVT varies with the etiology of the cardiomyopathy. In patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction due to prior myocardial infarction (MI), VPBs and NSVT are associated with an increased risk of SCD. In contrast, in most other forms of cardiomyopathy (eg, nonischemic cardiomyopathy or valve disease), these arrhythmias do not appear to predict SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The secondary and primary prevention of SCD in these patients, including a review of the causes of death in HF, and the importance of ventricular arrhythmias in other causes of cardiomyopathy, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, are discussed separately.

Among patients with cardiomyopathy, VPBs may be clinically significant for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VPBs may be predictors of more malignant arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). In patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI), VPBs are associated with an increased risk of death. In contrast, VPBs do not appear to be associated with a worse prognosis in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, although data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Regardless of the etiology of the cardiomyopathy, there is no role for pharmacologic suppression of VPBs for the purpose of reducing the risk of malignant arrhythmias or SCD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylaxis against ventricular arrhythmias during and after acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-premature-beats#H15573441\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular premature beats&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VPBs can cause symptoms, usually palpitations. Symptoms are generally mild, and most patients require no specific therapy. Beta blockers can help to control symptoms (particularly palpitations related to the post-extrasystolic potentiation of myocardial contractility), but most patients with HF and cardiomyopathy already have an indication for a beta blocker. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because of the proarrhythmic risks of antiarrhythmic drugs (which is particularly increased in patient with HF) other than beta blockers, these medications are not used in the routine treatment of VPBs. In the rare circumstance in which a patient is severely symptomatic despite beta blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a> appear to be safe in patients with HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-premature-beats#H15573441\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular premature beats&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In rare cases, very frequent VPBs cause or exacerbate LV dysfunction. This was illustrated in a report of 14 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &le;40 percent, and more than 20,000 VPBs in 24 hours (14 <span class=\"nowrap\">VPBs/min)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. All patients had been treated with standard medical therapy for HF. Seven patients received additional medical therapy (mostly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>), five of whom, all with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, had at least a 75 percent reduction in VPB frequency (baseline value 37,334 VPBs in 24 hours or 26 <span class=\"nowrap\">VPBs/min)</span>. These patients had a significant and marked improvement in LVEF at six months (49 versus 27 percent at baseline). In contrast, an increase in LVEF was not noted in the remaining patients who did not have such a reduction in VPB frequency (9 percent increase to 37 percent reduction).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among the five responders, only one received a new medical therapy (a beta blocker) that might have improved left ventricular function. This makes it less likely that the improvement in LVEF was the primary event, leading to a secondary reduction in VPBs. Thus, in some patients with <strong>very frequent</strong> VPBs, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> to assess possible improvement in LVEF may be beneficial as an addition to routine beta blocker therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, catheter ablation of very frequent VPBs may improve left ventricular function in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. This was illustrated in a nonrandomized study in which VPBs (mean 21 percent of QRS complexes) were successfully ablated in 18 of 22 patients with reduced LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In these patients, mean LVEF increased from 34 to 59 percent. The four patients in whom ablation was unsuccessful experienced further deterioration in LVEF, from 34 to 25 percent, during follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) have been observed on ambulatory monitoring in 50 to 80 percent of patients with HF or cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/5,8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,11</a>]. We define NSVT as three or more consecutive ventricular beats at a rate of greater than 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> with a duration of less than 30 seconds and no associated hemodynamic collapse. There is, however, great variability in the literature in the definition of this arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Some definitions allow a rate as low as 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> or as high as 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute;</span> others require five complexes, limit NSVT to fewer than 15 beats or to as many as 99 beats, and vary the duration from as short as 15 seconds or as high as one minute.</p><p>The clinical significance of NSVT can be considered in a similar manner to that of VPBs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSVT may be predictive of future malignant arrhythmias and mortality. An association between NSVT and mortality has been shown in patients with ischemic and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but not in most other forms of cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incidence of and risk stratification for sudden cardiac death after acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Assessment and management of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PROMISE study of 1080 patients with class III and IV heart failure found that, although the frequency of NSVT was a significant independent predictor of both sudden and nonsudden death mortality, multiple logistic analysis did not specifically define a group at high risk for sudden death and showed that NSVT did not provide incremental prognostic information beyond that from readily available clinical variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is generally no role for the pharmacologic suppression of NSVT for the purpose of reducing the risk of malignant arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. However, NSVT can be an indication for electrophysiology study and possible implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in selected patients with a prior MI and ischemic cardiomyopathy, and for an ICD in selected patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy#H547145918\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'SCD risk prediction post-MI'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk#H360925449\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Assessment and management of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death risk&quot;, section on 'Established high-risk clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsustained-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia: Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSVT is often asymptomatic, but some patients experience palpitations, lightheadedness, presyncope, or dyspnea. Because many of the symptoms that may be attributed to NSVT are vague and nonspecific, it is important to try to correlate symptoms to episodes of NSVT before initiating therapy. In patients with symptoms due to NSVT, options include beta blockers, for which most patients already have an indication, catheter ablation, and, in rare cases of severe and refractory symptoms, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>. Importantly, an ICD that is useful for terminating a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia is not useful for suppressing NSVT and treating symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsustained-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia: Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In rare cases, very frequent NSVT can contribute to or exacerbate LV dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Accelerated idioventricular rhythm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR), which has also been called &quot;slow VT,&quot; arises below the atrioventricular node and has, by definition, a rate between 50 and 100 or 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52385\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef52385 \">waveform 1</a>). When the AIVR is an accelerated rhythm, there is AV dissociation present, but the rate of the QRS complexes is faster than the atrial rate. In contrast, when associated with complete heart block, there is AV dissociation present, but the atrial rate is faster than the rate of the QRS complexes. In patients with sinus node dysfunction, AIVR can be an escape rhythm, while in other cases it reflects an abnormal ectopic focus in the ventricle that competes with the sinus node. In either case, AIVR is accelerated by sympathetic stimulation and circulating catecholamines.</p><p>AIVR occurs in approximately 8 percent of patients with HF or cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It also occurs in up to 50 percent of patients during an acute MI, most commonly in patients undergoing revascularization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Accelerated idioventricular rhythm'</a>.)</p><p>Most episodes of AIVR are transient and require no treatment. Furthermore, pharmacologic treatment is CONTRAINDICATED if AIVR is an escape rhythm (ie, complete heart block in which the atrial rate is faster than the ventricular rate or if there is sinus node dysfunction), since suppression of the pacemaker focus can result in asystole. Patients with symptomatic AIVR due to sinus node dysfunction may benefit from atrial pacing. There are no convincing data linking AIVR to sustained VT or VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Sustained VT or VF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the high prevalence of VPBs and NSVT in patients with HF or cardiomyopathy, sustained VT is unusual, occurring in &le;5 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/5,8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,11</a>].

Antiarrhythmic drugs, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, are alternative therapies for patients who refuse an ICD or who have comorbidities.

This is a relatively rare phenomenon, and both terminology and definitions vary. Electrical storm is most commonly associated with acute MI and coronary artery disease, but can also develop in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.</p><p>The incidence of electrical storm appears to be higher among patients receiving ICDs for secondary prevention than among those receiving ICDs for primary prevention. Implications and treatment of electrical storm are discussed separately.

This evaluation often includes an electrophysiology study, both to exclude the possibility of a bradyarrhythmic cause and to attempt to induce ventricular arrhythmias. Patients in whom no etiology of syncope is found are said to have unexplained syncope. Extended ambulatory monitoring is often used to establish the etiology for unexplained syncope.
