An allergic reaction may be defined as an idiosyncratic reaction that is caused by an immunologic mechanism.</p><p>The World Allergy Organization (WAO) has recommended categorizing immunologic reactions to drugs (including vaccines) based upon the timing of the appearance of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This system defines two general types of reactions: immediate and delayed. This approach is intended to distinguish immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated (type I immunologic reactions), which account for many immediate reactions, from other types, because these reactions carry the risk of life-threatening anaphylaxis if the patient is reexposed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate reactions begin within one hour of administration and may begin within minutes. IgE-mediated reactions are most likely to present within this time period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed reactions appear several hours to days after administration. These reactions may be caused by several different mechanisms, but they are rarely IgE-mediated.</p><p/><p>This topic review focuses on immediate-type allergic reactions to vaccines, although delayed reactions are also discussed briefly. Of note, the administration of influenza vaccine to egg-allergic patients is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Influenza vaccination in individuals with egg allergy&quot;</a>). Additional information about other types of adverse reactions to immunization, including unsubstantiated concerns about autism, is found in reviews of specific vaccines, elsewhere within UpToDate.

Anaphylaxis is defined as a systemic allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are rare, with rates from active surveillance studies ranging from 0.65 to 1.31 per million vaccine doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis have been proposed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious <span class=\"nowrap\">Disease/Food</span> Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network symposium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h4\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When anaphylaxis occurs after administration of a vaccine, patients generally develop symptoms within 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], although the onset may occasionally be delayed up to several hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The later onset reactions tend to be less severe. Reactions that occur hours to days after vaccine administration could be due to delayed absorption of the allergenic component. Alternatively, some of these late reactions may not be causally related to vaccination, but rather due to exposure to another allergen after vaccination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed vaccine reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several types of delayed reactions to vaccines have been noted, including common reactions like fever or local swelling, and various rare reactions. These may be immunologic or nonimmunologic in nature.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fever</strong> &ndash; Fever and irritability are common after vaccination and should not preclude additional doses of the same vaccine in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Local reactions</strong> &ndash; Local reactions to vaccination, such as swelling and redness at the injection site, are common and self-limited. These should not be considered reasons for avoiding administration of further doses of the vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Local reactions can be treated with cool compresses for the first hours after symptoms appear or with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if pain or swelling is troublesome. However, antipyretics should not be administered empirically or prophylactically, as a few studies have found that these medications may reduce the immune response to vaccination. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-immunizations-for-children-and-adolescents-overview#H3846494390\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic medications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It was believed that shorter intervals between vaccine doses were associated with increased rates of local reactions, although studies have now shown that this is not the case. The recommended interval between doses of tetanus-containing vaccines had been 10 years. New vaccines were recommended in 2006 to provide not only booster doses for tetanus and diphtheria (Td), but also to pertussis (Tdap) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Two subsequent studies reported rates of local reactions in patients given the new vaccine. In one, the rates of injection site reactions to Tdap were no different among subjects who had received Td within the past two years, compared with those vaccinated with Td more than two years before [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Another study found no higher rates of injection site reactions whether a Tdap-containing vaccine was administered one month after a Td-containing vaccine or after placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is now recommended that Tdap be given to all adolescents and adults regardless of interval since the last Td [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions</strong> &ndash; Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions involve rash, fever, malaise, and polyarthralgias or polyarthritis, occurring one to two weeks after vaccination or sooner if the patient has received the vaccine more than once. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other rare reactions</strong> &ndash; Delayed immunologic reactions include rare cases of persistent itchy injection site nodules to aluminum-containing vaccines that may be related to delayed-type hypersensitivity to aluminum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Another rare reaction is encephalopathy. Some of these more severe reactions may constitute contraindications to further doses of specific vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4744967\"><span class=\"h2\">Vasovagal reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccine administration may elicit vasovagal reactions (fainting), particularly in patients who are prone to this response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Vasovagal reactions are characterized by hypotension, pallor, diaphoresis, weakness, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, and if severe, by loss of consciousness.</p><p>Vasovagal reactions can mimic anaphylaxis, because both may involve hypotension and collapse. However, the cutaneous signs and symptoms are usually quite different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Fainting is usually preceded by pallor, whereas anaphylaxis often begins with flushing and may also include itching, urticaria, and angioedema. In anaphylaxis, tachycardia is more common than bradycardia.</p><p>In patients who report past fainting in response to vaccinations, it is prudent to administer future vaccines while the patient is lying supine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">REACTIONS TO VACCINE CONSTITUENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many different nonmicrobial constituents of vaccines could potentially result in systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.

Anaphylaxis from gelatin in influenza and zoster vaccines has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Reactions to zoster vaccine have been described in patients sensitized to alpha-gal, a carbohydrate allergen that also causes allergy to mammalian meats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Some patients had clinical allergy to beef and pork. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-to-meats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy to meats&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A history of allergy to the ingestion of gelatin and gelatin-containing foods (eg, marshmallows and &quot;gummi&quot; candies) should be sought prior to the administration of any gelatin-containing vaccine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63833 \">table 4</a>). However, a negative history of an allergic reaction to the ingestion of gelatin does not exclude gelatin as being responsible for an allergic reaction when injected with the vaccine, and patients who have experienced a reaction to a vaccine may require testing for gelatin allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing with vaccines and vaccine constituents'</a> below.)</p><p>Persons who react to gelatin on ingestion should be evaluated by an allergist prior to vaccine administration. If the history is consistent with an immediate-type allergic reaction to gelatin and this is confirmed by skin tests or serum-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody tests to gelatin, it is prudent to skin test such patients with gelatin-containing vaccines prior to administration. If the vaccine skin tests are negative, the vaccine can be given in the usual manner, but the patient observed for at least 30 minutes afterward. If the vaccine skin tests are positive, the vaccine can be administered in graded doses. Alternatively, gelatin-free brands of some vaccines, such as MMR and varicella, are available in some countries, although not in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>The incidence of allergic reactions to gelatin in vaccines was particularly high in Japan, a phenomenon that was subsequently attributed, in part, to genetic characteristics of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Japanese manufacturers removed gelatin from some vaccines and switched to a more thoroughly hydrolyzed gelatin in others, with a dramatic reduction in the rate of reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These strategies have been variably adopted in other countries and reactions to gelatin in vaccines still occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63833 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Egg</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Egg protein is present in yellow fever, MMR, and some influenza and rabies vaccines.

The vaccines are prepared in a medium derived from cow's milk protein, and nanogram quantities of residual casein have been demonstrated in these preparations. However, the vast majority of even severely milk-allergic patients have no allergic reactions to these vaccines. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Tetanus'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Thimerosal, aluminum, and phenoxyethanol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thimerosal, aluminum, and phenoxyethanol are added to some vaccines as preservatives, although the use of thimerosal (which contains mercury) in vaccines has decreased dramatically due to theoretical concerns about cumulative mercury exposure in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-childhood-vaccines-parental-hesitancy-or-refusal#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard childhood vaccines: Parental hesitancy or refusal&quot;, section on 'Why parents refuse vaccines'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-and-chronic-disease-no-evidence-for-vaccines-or-thimerosal-as-a-contributing-factor#H3496128066\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder and chronic disease: No evidence for vaccines or thimerosal as a contributing factor&quot;, section on 'Mercury toxicity'</a>.)</p><p>These preservatives have not been documented to cause immediate-type allergic reactions to vaccines and immediate-type skin testing is not generally indicated. However, they can cause delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and contact dermatitis when applied topically to the skin:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact sensitivity to them is not a contraindication to receiving vaccines containing them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/7,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,33-35</a>]. There is a case report of an adult who developed a generalized maculopapular rash to a thimerosal-containing influenza vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This was thought to be a T cell-mediated allergic response to thimerosal because of a positive patch test to this substance. This is a rare and unpredictable complication, if indeed there is actually a causal relationship.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability of these agents to cause delayed local reactions after vaccination is another concern for which some limited evidence exists. One study examined 125 patients with patch test-positive contact sensitivity to thimerosal or its derivatives, who were challenged with intramuscular injections of thimerosal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Only 4 percent (five patients) developed mild local reactions to the injection, indicating that local reactions are uncommon even in these contact-sensitized patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely, aluminum-containing vaccines cause persistent nodules at the injection site, possibly because of delayed hypersensitivity or other immune responses to aluminum.</p><p/><p>Thus, patch testing or any specific testing for suspected sensitivity to these preservatives for the purpose of assessing a patient's ability to tolerate a vaccine containing it, is not necessary. Patch testing can be performed for the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis, but this is not helpful in relation to vaccination. If a patient with documented contact dermatitis to one of these additives is concerned about receiving a vaccine containing the same agent, then it is prudent to administer a formulation that does not contain it, if available. Similarly, if a patient with known contact sensitivity has had a bothersome local reaction to a vaccine containing the preservative in the past and needs another, it would be prudent to give a product that is free of that preservative, if available. However, if a vaccine without the preservative is not available, the risk of any local reaction is minimal and should not preclude vaccination. (See <a href=\"#H3417929\" class=\"local\">'Sources of information'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimicrobials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several antimicrobials may be added in trace amounts to vaccines, most commonly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a>. Although there are no specific reports of vaccine-induced anaphylaxis in which these drugs were found to be the cause, the rare patients who have experienced anaphylactic reactions confirmed to be due to these antibiotics should not receive vaccines containing them without prior evaluation by an allergist. (See <a href=\"#H3417929\" class=\"local\">'Sources of information'</a> above.)</p><p>In contrast, contact dermatitis to these antimicrobials is not a contraindication to administration of vaccines containing trace amounts of them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Latex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The &quot;rubber&quot; in vaccine vial stoppers or syringe plungers may be either dry natural rubber (DNR) latex or synthetic rubber. Those made with latex pose a theoretical risk to latex-allergic patients, either as a result of liquid vaccine solution extracting latex allergens from the stopper by physical contact or by passing the needle through the stopper and retaining latex allergen in or on the needle. One report of an anaphylactic reaction after hepatitis B vaccine administered to a latex-allergic patient was attributed to rubber in the stopper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A review of &gt;160,000 reports from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) found only 28 cases of possible immediate-type allergic reactions after receiving a DNR-containing vaccine, and these may have been due to other components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

These 19 had abnormally high levels of IgE directed against whole vaccine and against several hemagglutinin proteins, while they did not have egg-specific IgE or IgE directed against the various excipients in the vaccines. Skin testing with full-strength vaccine was performed in just three patients, but was positive in all three and negative in 10 control patients, including some with egg allergy. The patients&rsquo; basophils were activated when incubated with the vaccine. These findings suggest (but do not prove) that the allergen was some component (possibly hemagglutinin) of the vaccine. Interestingly, all reactions were caused by a vaccine from one specific manufacturer, and this preparation was unique in containing the preservative 2-phenoxyethanol (2-PE). IgE to 2-PE was not detected in the patients&rsquo; sera, but the authors hypothesized that 2-PE may interact with vaccine components to enhance allergenicity in some way.

Of note, this algorithm applies to patients with a history of a suspected allergic reaction <strong>to a vaccine</strong>.</p><p>In contrast, the diagnostic approach is different for a patient who has reacted to a <strong>vaccine constituent,</strong> such as gelatin, egg, latex, or yeast, but not to the vaccination itself. The most commonly encountered example of this situation is influenza vaccination of a patient with egg allergy, which is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Influenza vaccination in individuals with egg allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Are the nature and timing of reaction consistent with anaphylaxis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to determine if the nature and timing of the reaction are consistent with an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated <span class=\"nowrap\">reaction/anaphylaxis</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Is there a history of a similar reaction?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It also important to obtain a possible history of similar reactions to the same or other vaccines, or to vaccine constituents. The various components of a vaccine are clearly listed in the package inserts supplied by the manufacturers.</p><p>If the reaction occurred with the first dose of a vaccine, the chance that the immunizing agent itself is the allergen is greatly diminished. In this clinical situation, healthcare professionals should also inquire about allergic reactions to food, particularly gelatin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63833 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Is there a need for future doses of this vaccine or other vaccines with common components?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a history has been obtained of a vaccine reaction occurring shortly after administration that is <strong>consistent</strong> with an IgE-mediated reaction, the clinician should determine if future doses of the suspect vaccine, or other vaccines with common components, are required. Given the potential for cross-reaction with common components in other vaccines and with foods, a thorough evaluation is appropriate, even if no further doses of the suspect vaccine are required.</p><p>Many vaccines are given as a series, yet some recipients generate an adequate response to fewer than the usual number of doses. Thus, it is reasonable to determine the antibody level achieved by the doses already received. Protective levels of specific antibody have been determined for many vaccines and some are routinely available in commercial reference laboratories. If a patient has already generated a protective response, then it may not be necessary to give the remaining doses in the series. However, the level of protective antibody may not persist as long in persons vaccinated with fewer than the usual number of doses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN TESTING WITH VACCINES AND VACCINE CONSTITUENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient is to receive further doses of a vaccine, skin testing with the vaccine should be performed. Proper performance and interpretation of skin tests requires expertise in the procedure, including the use of appropriate positive and negative controls. Also, skin tests themselves can rarely cause anaphylactic reactions in highly allergic individuals. Thus, skin testing should only be performed by persons such as allergists with training in interpretation of, and treatment of possible reactions to, the tests, and only in a setting where anaphylactic reactions can be recognized and treated quickly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vaccine should first be tested by the skin prick method. Full-strength vaccine can be used, unless the history of reaction was truly life-threatening, in which case it is appropriate to dilute the vaccine before skin prick testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>If the full-strength prick test is negative, an intradermal test with the vaccine diluted 1:100 in 0.9 percent (isotonic) saline should be performed, again with appropriate positive and negative controls. (See <a href=\"#H37\" class=\"local\">'Irritant reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpreting skin tests to vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history of the reaction is critically important in interpreting skin tests to vaccines. Clinically irrelevant positive skin tests are possible, as with skin testing to any allergen. The presence of a positive skin test to a vaccine is not necessarily predictive of a subsequent reaction, although it must be viewed as a significant risk factor.</p><p>Vaccines can induce immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody production in the days to weeks after vaccination, although the clinical significance of this is unclear. Specific IgE to diphtheria (DT) and tetanus toxoids was induced by vaccination and found to persist for at least two years after immunization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. This specific IgE was not associated with allergic reactions with subsequent vaccination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h3\">Irritant reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irritant (false-positive) skin test reactions are also possible, particularly with intradermal testing at concentrations of 1:10 or undiluted. One study of 20 adult volunteers without histories of vaccine reactions evaluated responses to skin prick testing and intradermal testing with 10 common vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Irritant reactions were not seen with skin prick testing and were uncommon after intradermal testing with a 1:100 concentration. However, they were common at higher intradermal concentrations (1:10 or undiluted). Thus, intradermal testing to vaccines should only be performed at the 1:100 concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions at the site of skin testing (particularly intradermal) with a vaccine have been observed.

These immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions are most often due to vaccine constituents rather than microbial products.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are similar to those of anaphylaxis from other etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 2</a>). They usually appear within 30 minutes but may rarely be delayed up to several hours. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There have been rare reports of systemic allergic reactions to nearly every vaccine, although some vaccines are more commonly implicated, including the vaccines for yellow fever, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), and tetanus. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'IgE-mediated reactions to specific vaccines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of a possible vaccine allergy begins with determining if symptoms and timing are consistent with an anaphylactic reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F81252\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81252 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 2</a>). The next step is discerning if the patient had previous exposure to the vaccine or needs further doses of the vaccine in question, or vaccines with common constituents, in the future. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the patient with suspected vaccine allergy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing to vaccines should be performed and interpreted by an allergy specialist. The skin prick test may be performed with an undiluted solution of the vaccine in question, or with a diluted solution in patients whose reactions were truly life-threatening. If negative, this is followed by intradermal testing with a 1:100 dilution of the vaccine. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing with vaccines and vaccine constituents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the suspect vaccine contains egg (yellow fever and some influenza), gelatin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63833 \">table 4</a>), latex, or <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> yeast (hepatitis B and 4- and 9-valent human papillomavirus), skin testing to these constituents should also be performed. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing with vaccines and vaccine constituents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If skin testing with the vaccine is negative, it is recommended that the patient receive the vaccine in the usual manner. For safety, such patients are usually given the vaccine under the supervision of the allergy specialist. (See <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Administration of vaccines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If skin testing to a constituent (gelatin, egg, etc) or the vaccine is positive, it may still be possible for the patient to receive the vaccine in a graded manner (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F81252\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81252 \">algorithm 1</a>). However, this should only be undertaken after a thorough assessment of the relative risks and benefits of vaccination. (See <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Administration of vaccines'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-reactions-to-vaccines/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Johansson SG, Bieber T, Dahl R, et al.
