Sclerotherapy is used primarily in the treatment of telangiectasias, reticular veins, and small varicose veins, which can be symptomatic and a source of significant distress to some patients even in the absence of symptoms. Saphenous and perforator reflux can also be treated with sclerotherapy techniques.</p><p>The treatment of telangiectasias, reticular veins, and varicose veins, and underlying perforator or saphenous reflux with liquid and foam sclerotherapy, will be reviewed here.</p><p>Alternative approaches to treatment of chronic venous disease using cutaneous laser, endovenous ablation devices, and open surgical management are discussed elsewhere.

Candidates for sclerotherapy are patients with persistent symptoms (eg, pain, aching, swelling) and signs (eg, telangiectasias, reticular veins, varicose veins, pigmentary changes, and ulceration) of venous disease after six months of medical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and management of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sclerotherapy may be used to treat superficial telangiectasias, reticular veins, and varicose veins. Sclerotherapy techniques to achieve perforator and saphenous closure are also available for patients with documented reflux (ie, retrograde flow &gt;0.5 seconds duration) as a source of their symptoms. For patients with ulceration who are refractory to medical management, or have recurrent ulceration, ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy (UGS) of perforators can lead to significant reduction of symptoms and signs.

Patients are informed that veins will lighten and become less noticeable but may not completely disappear, that hyperpigmentation is a relatively common complication, and that multiple treatments are typically required to achieve the desired effect.</p><p>For all patients, it is important to address patient expectations, potential adverse effects, potential failure of treatment, and the complications of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients must understand that the results of sclerotherapy are unpredictable despite expert technique, and some patients with favorable conditions (skin type I and II, ideal injections) may have unsatisfactory results.

These substances cause endothelial damage by their actions as either osmotic or detergent agents. Osmotic agents achieve their effect by dehydrating endothelial cells through osmosis. Detergents are surface active agents that damage the endothelium by interfering with cell membrane lipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In vitro, the detergent agents also exhibit procoagulant activity at lower concentrations, and anticoagulant activity in higher concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Systematic reviews of randomized trials of injection sclerotherapy for telangiectasia or varicosities found no evidence to support the use of one sclerosant over another in the short-term success of sclerotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Sodium tetradecyl sulfate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-tetradecyl-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium tetradecyl sulfate</a> is the most commonly studied sclerosant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The maximum recommended dosage is 10 mL of a 3% solution in the United States and Canada; the volume used varies worldwide depending on formulation. Dilutions between 0.1% and 3.0% are used depending upon the size of the vein treated; narrower-diameter veins are treated with lower concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70171\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70171 \">table 1</a>). As an example, in small-diameter veins, a systematic review comparing various sclerotherapy agents for the treatment of telangiectasias found that sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) was more likely to cause adverse reactions at a concentration of 1% compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polidocanol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polidocanol</a> at 0.5% [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Polidocanol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polidocanol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Polidocanol</a>, also known as aethoxysklerol, is also a detergent.

Polidocanol is now available for commercial use in the United States (ie, Asclera). In a systematic review comparing various sclerotherapy agents for the treatment of telangiectasias, polidocanol was no more painful than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertonic saline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertonic saline is the most commonly used osmotic agent for lower extremity sclerotherapy.

When vessels are treated sequentially from deep to superficial and from larger to smaller veins, over 90 percent of vessels can be successfully treated. The results of sclerotherapy are usually, but are not always, superior to those of cutaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">laser/light</span> therapy.</p><p>Due to the risk of longstanding hypopigmentation from laser and light treatments, liquid sclerotherapy is a more appropriate choice for patients with Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V, and VI. <span class=\"nowrap\">Laser/light</span> treatments are recommended for patients who have failed sclerotherapy, those with veins too small to access (&lt;0.3 mm) or poor outcome, patients with postsclerotherapy matting, needle-phobic patients, and patients allergic to sclerosant agents. <span class=\"nowrap\">Laser/light</span> treatment is also preferred for vessels located at or below the ankle regions, which are more prone to ulceration with sclerotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser and light therapy of lower extremity telangiectasias, reticular veins, and small varicose veins&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Foam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foam preparations are becoming increasingly popular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Sclerosant foam was developed from the detergent sclerosant agents to increase the surface area of exposure and is more commonly used for the treatment of larger veins. </p><p>The foam can be produced manually just prior to injection using the Tessari method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79497\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79497 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Foam prepared according to the Tessari technique has a half-life of approximately 90 seconds. Thus, the procedure should be completed within one minute, before the foam separates. An alternative consists of a product that dispenses a low-nitrogen gas and sclerosant liquid under pressure to produce a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polidocanol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polidocanol</a> foam with appreciably smaller and consistently sized bubbles compared with a <span class=\"nowrap\">foam/air</span> mixture made by hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Phase III trials (VANISH-1 and VANISH-2) have confirmed the safety and efficacy of polidocanol endovenous microfoam (Varisolve) for improving symptoms when used to treat superficial venous incompetence, leading to approval in the United States in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Sclerosant foam is echogenic due to the tiny air bubbles in the foam, which are easily seen with duplex ultrasound. The expanded volume of the foam compared with liquid agents provides more surface contact, a more uniform vessel closure, and use of smaller volumes of sclerosant. In principle, all vein calibers are suitable for foam sclerotherapy; however, a minority of practitioners would use it for treatment of telangiectasias or reticular veins because there is no significant advantage over liquid sclerotherapy in small vessels, and, therefore, ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) is predominantly applied to the treatment of saphenous incompetence (great or small) and incompetent perforating veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20954086\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyanoacrylate glue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A system that ablates the treated vein using an adhesive agent (VenaSeal) has been approved for use in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The use of glue was initially described for treatment of saphenous incompetence in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The procedure is performed like radiofrequency and laser ablation, but without the need for tumescent anesthesia. In a randomized trial comparing this system with radiofrequency ablation, short-term outcomes at three months were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Longer-term follow-up is needed to determine the durability of the results.

If the first injection is near the saphenofemoral junction, the vein above the catheter is compressed with the ultrasound probe prior to injection to prevent injection into the deep veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/23,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25,26</a>]. The feasibility of the use of this system for perforating veins was investigated in a separate study; there were no serious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus on specific aspects of sclerotherapy technique, including type of sclerosing agent, use of local anesthetic, use or type of local compression pad, and use or duration of compression dressing (bandage or elastic). Serial injections are often needed to address the veins of interest. Typical sessions last from 15 to 60 minutes.</p><p>In general, a sclerosant liquid or foam (with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>) is mixed into a syringe at the appropriate concentration for the vein to be treated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70171\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70171 \">table 1</a>). The syringe is attached to a 27- or 30-gauge needle (or butterfly), which is angled to assist its introduction into the vessel. The patient is placed in Trendelenburg position during injection to discourage refilling of the injected veins. Following the application of alcohol to clean the area, the needle is introduced into the vein and blood aspirated to ensure an intraluminal needle position; the sclerosant is then injected.</p><p>The procedure is terminated when either the maximum volume of sclerosant has been injected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70171\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70171 \">table 1</a>) or all the veins of interest have been treated. A light dressing and graduated compression stockings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74574 \">table 2</a>), or bandages (Coban, Elastocrepe, Ace) are applied.</p><p>The patient is discharged, providing <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> has experienced no adverse reactions.

When larger underlying reticular veins are identified, these are obliterated prior to addressing more superficial telangiectasias. A vein light (fiberoptic illuminator) is helpful in identifying reticular veins.</p><p>The needle is withdrawn and local compression and massage are applied to keep blood out of the lumen of the vessel and to help disperse the sclerosant.

The saphenous vein is cannulated in the mid to distal thigh with the needle directed toward the foot. The extremity is elevated and sclerosant foam injected until it is visualized approaching the saphenofemoral junction, whereupon the injection is discontinued. The syringe is aspirated, and if blood is returned the procedure is repeated until the aspirate becomes white, indicating that the saphenous vein is filled with foam. Compression at the level of the groin can be performed. A study that evaluated a small number of patients for whom ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy was performed in combination with compression of the saphenofemoral junction found that this practice reduced but did not completely prevent migration of the foam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Popliteal vein thrombosis has been reported with foam sclerotherapy of the small saphenous vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

Symptoms include visual disturbance (scotoma), migraine-like headache, and neurologic deficits. These appear to be more common with foam compared with liquid sclerotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/47,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,49</a>].</p><p>Visual disturbances reported following sclerotherapy of telangiectasias and reticular veins are strongly associated with the use of air-block and foam techniques, suggesting that the etiology is air microembolization. Most visual disturbances occur during or immediately after the procedure when the patient ambulates, possibly due to rising microbubbles in the bloodstream. In one study, 20 of 12,173 patients (0.16 percent) treated with sclerotherapy experienced visual disturbances, 70 percent of which were following sclerotherapy of telangiectasias or reticular veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Visual disturbances were associated with nausea, headache, or vasovagal fainting; all cases regressed spontaneously.</p><p>During foam sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein, microbubbles can be detected in the right heart and pulmonary circulation, in patients with a patent foramen ovale (PFO), and in the left heart as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/10,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,50</a>]. Coughing following foam sclerotherapy has been attributed to air microembolization into the pulmonary circulation. In a prospective study of 33 patients, cardiac echo was performed during foam sclerotherapy with cardiac microemboli detected in every patient studied. Microemboli were also seen in the left ventricle of five patients, and each was subsequently found to have a patent foramen ovale; however, none of these patients experienced neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Given the significant prevalence (25 to 30 percent) of patent foramen ovale in the general population, it is apparent that the incidence of significant neurologic sequelae following foam sclerotherapy is low. Nevertheless, caution needs to be exercised when performing foam sclerotherapy in any patient known to have a PFO. Patients who develop neurologic symptoms following foam sclerotherapy should be referred for further cardiac evaluation and are advised to avoid future sclerotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patent-foramen-ovale\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patent foramen ovale&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial septal abnormalities (PFO, ASD, and ASA) and risk of cerebral emboli in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because visual and neurologic disturbances have been reported with non-foamed (ie, liquid) sclerosant solutions, and have occurred in the absence of a PFO, an alternative theory has been proposed. It proposes that visual and neurologic symptoms related to sclerotherapy are due to the release of endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor. One group found increased concentrations of endothelin in the blood following injection with various sclerosing agents, first in an animal model and then in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis can occur with any of the sclerosing agents with the exception of hypertonic saline.
