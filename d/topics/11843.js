The term &quot;seizure&quot; refers to a transient occurrence of signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms due to abnormal excessive neuronal activity of the brain.</p><p>Paroxysmal events are frequent in infancy. In one population-based cohort, they occurred in 9 percent of those in the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While seizures and epilepsy are commonly considered in the differential, these make up a small fraction (&lt;10 percent) of these events.</p><p>Neonates and infants exhibit nonepileptic paroxysmal episodes that differ from those encountered in older children and adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81289\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81289 \">table 1</a>). These may be difficult to differentiate from epileptic events because of the overlapping clinical symptoms as well as the difficulty in interpreting neonatal and infant electroencephalograms (EEG). It is important for clinicians to be aware of and recognize the transient nonepileptic events that resemble seizures in order to avoid unnecessary treatment and to institute the correct treatment when required.</p><p>This topic reviews nonepileptic paroxysmal events in the neonate and infant. The differential diagnosis of epilepsy in other age groups is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEONATES (BIRTH TO ONE MONTH OF AGE)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal neonates commonly exhibit a variety of paroxysmal movements including nonconjugate eye movements, sucking movements without associated eye abnormalities, and sleep-related myoclonus. These normal behaviors as well as the pathologic conditions discussed below can be difficult to distinguish from epileptic seizures, which can also have somewhat subtle manifestations. Electroencephalography (EEG), particularly video-EEG monitoring, can be invaluable in distinguishing among these entities. In one study of neonates, 90 percent of abnormal movements suspicious for seizures were found to be nonepileptic on EEG recording [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-seizures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of neonatal seizures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Apnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apnea, or a pause in breathing for greater than 20 seconds, is usually not due to an epileptic seizure, particularly if apnea is the sole manifestation. Apneic episodes are common in premature children during active sleep and are believed to be due to brainstem immaturity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-apnea-of-prematurity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of apnea of prematurity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Compared with epileptic seizures, episodes of nonepileptic apnea are more likely to include bradycardia and typically do not include tachycardia or significant alterations in blood pressure, body temperature, or skin color [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. A few jerks may occur, but the baby does not convulse. An epileptic seizure should be suspected if apnea is accompanied by eye closure or opening, eye deviation, mouth movement, hypertension, or tachycardia.</p><p>When apnea occurs in older infants, it may represent a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The history and physical examination in infants who have experienced BRUE should identify features that suggest a specific cause of the event (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">choking/laryngospasm</span> or an upper respiratory infection) or characteristics that suggest a higher risk for having a serious underlying disease. The evaluation and management of BRUE are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute events in infancy including brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Jitteriness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jitteriness is a common movement seen in the neonatal period, typically observed as an excessive response to stimulation such as touch or loud noise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,10</a>]. It has a tremulous quality, with a back-and-forth oscillation of equal amplitude and frequency. In contrast to seizures, the child is typically awake during the events and no associated autonomic disturbance is evident. The movement can be lessened by consoling the child, removing the stimulus, or relaxing the affected limb, interventions that do not affect seizure activity. The provocation of events by stimulus is also atypical for seizures. In addition, head or eye deviation during an episode suggests seizure.</p><p>Mild degrees of jitteriness are common in healthy infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. More severe jitteriness can interfere with feeding and other aspects of normal infant care. Jitteriness is often associated with drug withdrawal, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, conditions that can also produce seizures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, also called benign sleep myoclonus of infancy, refers to a phenomenon of repetitive myoclonic jerks that occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in the first few weeks of life and resolve spontaneously by two to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. The jerks are typically bilateral, symmetric movements of the arms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> legs.</p><p>Features that help distinguish these myoclonic jerks from epileptic events include the absence of autonomic disturbances, myoclonic jerks occurring only while asleep, and a normal EEG and neurologic and developmental examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. Unlike epileptic seizures, the movement of benign neonatal sleep myoclonus will cease when the baby is aroused. Neonates with severe cerebral dysfunction can also have myoclonic jerks, but these typically occur with a stimulus, or upon wakening or falling asleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperekplexia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperekplexia (stiff baby syndrome or startle disease) is a rare genetic disease that has been associated with a variety of gene mutations usually affecting the glycine receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H38\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperkinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Hyperekplexia'</a>.)</p><p>The disease is characterized by a triad of generalized stiffness while awake, nocturnal myoclonus, and an exaggerated startle reflex. These features are often apparent at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Episodes of hypertonia or tonic spasms occur upon awakening or with auditory or tactile stimuli. When severe, these may interfere with breathing and can even cause hypoxic brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Attacks may be resolved by manual flexion of the neck or hips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. All of these features are atypical for epileptic seizures.</p><p>These tonic spasms can also cause older infants to fall suddenly in response to surprise, sensory stimuli, strong emotion, or stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As a result, walking is often delayed. The spasms lessen in severity and usually disappear as the child grows older, but an excessive startle response may persist throughout life, elicited even by minor visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Clonazepam</a>, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist, appears to be effective for alleviating hypertonia and apneic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/18,19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,21</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a>, and sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a> also have been cited in the literature as effective therapies for hypertonia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormal startle response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1942675\"><span class=\"h2\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sodium channelopathy causing episodic laryngospasm, along with face and limb myotonia, has been described in three neonates, each carrying a de novo mutation of the muscle sodium channel gene <em>SCN4A</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Although clinical symptomatology helps to differentiate these from epileptic seizures, electroencephalography (EEG), particularly video-EEG monitoring, can be invaluable in the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-diagnosis-of-seizures-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of seizures in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Breath-holding spells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breath-holding spells are common events in infants and young children from six months to six years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Most children (80 to 90 percent) with these spells have their first episode before 18 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Rarely, cases first present as neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of these syncopal events is not clear. Some studies support a primary role for dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/27,28,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,32</a>]. Iron deficiency anemia is more prevalent in children with breath-holding spells compared with controls and appears to contribute to the occurrence of breath-holding spells and the underlying dysautonomia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. An association between breath-holding spells and other types of anemia, including transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC), has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>A family history of breath-holding spells is present in 20 to 35 percent of patients and an autosomal dominant trait has been reported in some families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/30,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,36</a>].</p><p>The two clinical types of breath-holding spells are cyanotic and pallid. Both family members and individual children can demonstrate both types, but usually one predominates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyanotic breath-holding spells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the cyanotic variety, the child becomes angry or upset in response to a reprimand or a mild injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The precipitant is often minimal, even trivial. There is a brief period of crying, typically followed quickly by breath-holding in forced expiration with apnea and cyanosis, which is then often followed by collapse with limpness and loss of consciousness. Cyanosis can appear faster than anticipated with simple breath-holding, and the loss of tone often is striking. The sequence is quite stereotyped and reproducible.</p><p>If the apnea is prolonged, there may be other clinical manifestations, including decorticate or decerebrate posturing. A few children have generalized motor seizures characterized by increased tone followed by loss of tone or clonic activity and prolonged postictal unconsciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Status epilepticus has been reported.</p><p>A significant minority of children (15 to 25 percent) have multiple episodes daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Most children have one to six spells per week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Pallid breath-holding spells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pallid infantile syncope is less common than the cyanotic variety and is more likely to be mistaken for a seizure. The child typically loses consciousness after a minor fall or blow to the head or upper body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Often, this history is not volunteered by the patient or family and must be elicited by direct questioning. The loss of consciousness may be delayed up to 30 seconds after the minor trauma, obscuring the connection between the two events. The child then stops breathing and becomes pale, diaphoretic, and limp. If the episode lasts more than a few seconds, this is followed by generalized increased tone of the trunk and extremities, often with incontinence and occasionally low-amplitude clonus. The entire episode lasts less than one minute, but the child is confused <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sleepy for several minutes afterward.</p><p>The event is caused by cardiac bradycardia. Events may be reproduced with 10 seconds of ocular pressure during electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, which produces a typical attack with a profound bradycardia, even asystole, usually lasting 5 to 10 seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Cases have been described in which the heart beat did not return for 30 seconds. If simultaneous EEG monitoring is performed, hypersynchronous, high-amplitude slowing may be observed, followed by flattening if the episode is prolonged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no diagnostic test that confirms the diagnosis of breath-holding spells. These may be difficult to distinguish from epileptic seizures. A history of any provocation (eg, head injury, crying) should be elicited, as this is typical for breath-holding spells, but not epileptic seizures. Prominent color change, pallor or cyanosis, also suggests breath-holding spells rather than seizures. As with other nonepileptic events, video-EEG monitoring can be helpful in difficult cases.</p><p>Other causes of syncope also should be considered. If the episodes are prolonged or frequent, precipitated by startle or other nontraumatic stimuli, or if a family history of syncope or sudden death exists, a more in-depth cardiac evaluation, particularly for prolonged QT syndrome, is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of syncope in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because iron deficiency anemia is highly associated with breath-holding spells, evaluation with complete blood count and serum ferritin is warranted in these children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/35,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,40</a>]. A blood lead level should also be measured in children who are found to be anemic, if it has not been done recently.

The median age of remission is four years; virtually all children stop having episodes by eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/28-30,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30,41</a>]. Neurologic development is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Iron supplementation in anemic or iron-deficient patients appears to reduce the frequency of breath-holding attacks, according to observational studies and one clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/36,40,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,40,43,44</a>]. Complete remission of spells reportedly occurs in 32 to 52 percent. A typical dose is 5 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of ferrous sulphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The duration of treatment should be individualized according to the improvement of clinical episodes and the anemia. The value of iron supplementation in children with breath-holding spells who are not anemic has not been well studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Antiseizure drugs are not helpful in reducing the breath-holding spells, and may or may not prevent secondary anoxic seizures if these are frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/30,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,45</a>]. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-derivative, piracetam (40 or 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in two divided doses), was shown in two randomized trials (one unblinded) to reduce the frequency of breath-holding spells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. This drug is not available in the United States.</p><p>In rare patients with severe attacks of pallid infantile syncope associated with prolonged, severe bradycardia or asystole, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atropine</a> and cardiac pacing have been employed to reduce the frequency of spells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/30,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,48,49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign myoclonus of infancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign myoclonus of infancy is also known as benign nonepileptic infantile spasms. The spasms can manifest as myoclonus, spasms with brief tonic contractions, shuddering, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atonia (negative myoclonus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Spasms occur in clusters, frequently at mealtime. First occurring at three to eight months of age, these clusters increase in intensity and severity over weeks or months and then remit spontaneously at two to three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>The clinical features of these attacks may be clinically indistinguishable from other types of progressive infantile spasms associated with mental retardation and epileptic seizures, although they typically occur only while awake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/50,51,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51,53</a>]. Benign myoclonus of infancy can be identified by a normal EEG and normal neurologic development without subsequent epilepsy.

These brief episodes of altered muscle tone often manifest as a rapid tremor of the head, shoulder, and trunk reminiscent of a &quot;shudder&quot; or &quot;shiver&quot; from a chill. There may be stiffening, flexion, and elevation of the arms with a low-amplitude tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. If seated, the child may lean in one direction or even fall. The child may stare, appear to be unaware of the surroundings, and then promptly return to the task at hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The episodes last a few seconds, and can occur multiple times a day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,56</a>]. The spells often occur with feeding, or when the child is excited or distressed, suggesting they are a pattern of stimulus overflow in a young child. They never occur during sleep and virtually never when being held and cuddled.</p><p>The EEG during the spells is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Neurologic and developmental examinations also are normal.</p><p>The episodes may continue at lower frequency into the second half of the first decade and can, on rare occasions, cause the child to fall in the middle of activities such as playing ball. Occasionally, a family history of benign essential tremor exists, but the children themselves do not have a chronic tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The spells spontaneously resolve by the second decade without treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Sandifer syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sandifer syndrome refers to the intermittent paroxysmal spells of generalized stiffening and opisthotonic posturing that are caused by gastroesophageal reflux in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. The posturing likely reflects a pain response to acidic reflux into the esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

A careful history will reveal that these spells are associated with feedings, usually occurring within 30 minutes following a meal.

The events begin and end suddenly, with a duration between a few hours and a few days. The child is alert and responsive during an attack. Episodes usually first occur in the first three months of life and may recur at varying intervals, resolving by the age of three years in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>].

They also can be present in deep sleep and in wakefulness. Episodes usually begin in infancy and resolve by five years of age, but can persist into adult life.
