The most common tests used in clinical practice include the serum aminotransferases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time. These tests are often referred to as &quot;liver function tests,&quot; although this term is somewhat misleading since most do not accurately reflect how well the liver is functioning, and abnormal values can be caused by diseases unrelated to the liver. In addition, these tests may be normal in patients who have advanced liver disease.</p><p>Several specialized tests have also been developed (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> [ICG] clearance), which, although uncommonly used in clinical practice, can measure specific aspects of hepatic function.</p><p>Despite their limitations, liver biochemical and function tests have many applications in clinical medicine:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They provide a noninvasive method to screen for the presence of liver disease. The serum aminotransferases, for example, are part of a panel of tests used to screen all blood donors in the United States for the presence of transmissible viruses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They can be used to measure the efficacy of treatments for liver disease (such as immunosuppressant agents for autoimmune hepatitis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They can be used to monitor the progression of a disease such as viral or alcoholic hepatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They can reflect the severity of liver disease, particularly in patients who have cirrhosis. As an example, the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (Child-Pugh class), which incorporates the prothrombin time and serum bilirubin and albumin concentrations, can predict survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>). Similarly, the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, based in part upon the serum bilirubin, is an accurate predictor of three-month mortality and is used routinely in determining the priority of patients awaiting liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The pattern of abnormalities on these tests is more accurate than any of the individual tests. An elevation of serum aminotransferases indicates hepatocellular injury, while an elevation of alkaline phosphatase indicates cholestasis. Recognizing patterns that are consistent with specific diseases can prompt appropriate additional testing.</p><p>The liver biochemical and function tests that are used commonly in clinical practice and that are used occasionally for specific circumstances can be categorized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests that detect injury to hepatocytes &ndash; Most of these tests measure the concentration of hepatic enzymes, such as the aminotransferases, in the circulation. These enzymes are normally intracellular but are released when hepatocytes are injured. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-biochemical-tests-that-detect-injury-to-hepatocytes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver biochemical tests that detect injury to hepatocytes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests of the liver's capacity to transport organic anions and metabolize drugs &ndash; These tests measure the liver's ability to clear endogenous or exogenous substances from the circulation. The best studies include serum measurements of bilirubin, bile acids, caffeine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> metabolites, a variety of breath tests, and clearance tests such as bromsulphalein (BSP) and ICG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests of the liver's biosynthetic capacity &ndash; The most commonly performed tests to assess the biosynthetic capacity of the liver are the serum albumin and the prothrombin time (which requires the presence of clotting factors produced in the liver). Other tests that have been used are the serum concentrations of lipoproteins, ceruloplasmin, ferritin, and alpha-1 antitrypsin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests that detect chronic inflammation in the liver, altered immunoregulation, or viral hepatitis &mdash; These tests include the immunoglobulins, hepatitis serologies, and specific autoantibodies. Most of these substances are proteins made by B lymphocytes, not by hepatocytes. However, some are quite specific for certain liver diseases, such as antimitochondrial antibodies in primary biliary cholangitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The liver contains thousands of enzymes, some of which are also present in serum in very low concentrations. Elevation of an enzyme activity in the serum primarily reflects release from damaged liver cells. Elevation of serum enzyme tests can be grouped into two categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enzymes that reflect generalized damage to hepatocytes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enzymes that reflect cholestasis</p><p/><p>This topic review will discuss the serum tests that reflect cholestasis. The other categories of liver function tests and enzymes that reflect generalized damage to hepatocytes are discussed separately.

Although alkaline phosphatase is found in many locations throughout the body, its precise function is not yet known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It appears to have an active role in down-regulating the secretory activities of the intrahepatic biliary epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>],and hydrolyzing phosphate esters to generate inorganic phosphate for uptake by various tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase detoxifies lipopolysaccharide and promotes commensal bacterial colonization of the intestine, and its absence is associated with increased intestinal inflammation, dysbiosis, bacterial translocation, and systemic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In bone, the enzyme is involved with calcification. At other sites, it may participate in transport processes.</p><p>At least three separate genes code for the different alkaline phosphatases that exist in multiple isoenzyme forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most of the alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes of clinical interest are derived from the liver, bone, first trimester placenta, and kidneys, and are coded for by one gene. They are called tissue unspecific alkaline phosphatase since they have the same immunologic properties and amino acid sequence. Although these alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes catalyze the same reactions, they have different physicochemical properties, which are conferred by carbohydrate and lipid side chains added during posttranslational modification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A second alkaline phosphatase gene codes for third trimester placental and intestinal alkaline phosphatase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The third gene codes for a second type of intestinal alkaline phosphatase.</p><p>Alkaline phosphatase activity in serum is derived primarily from three sources: liver, bone, and in some patients the intestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. The intestinal contribution (about 10 to 20 percent) is of importance primarily in people with blood groups O and B who are secretors of the ABH red blood cell antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; it is enhanced by consumption of a fatty meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] and has limited clinical importance.</p><p>Circulating alkaline phosphatase appears to behave like other serum proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Its half-life is seven days, and its clearance from serum is independent of the functional capacity of the liver or the patency of the bile ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Its sites of degradation are unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of elevated concentration in hepatobiliary disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased serum alkaline phosphatase is derived from tissues whose metabolism is either functionally disturbed (the obstructed liver) or greatly stimulated (placenta in the third trimester of pregnancy and bone in growing children). The cause in hepatobiliary disease has been debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Two theories were proposed in the past: the damaged liver regurgitates hepatic alkaline phosphatase back into serum; and the damaged liver, particularly if due to obstructive jaundice, fails to excrete the alkaline phosphatase made in bone, the intestines, and the liver. This long-standing debate was resolved in favor of the regurgitation of liver alkaline phosphatase into serum. The data supporting this theory include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only hepatic alkaline phosphatase is found in the serum of patients with liver disease, particularly cholestasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clearance rates of infused placental alkaline phosphatase are the same in patients with bile duct obstruction and healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In experimental bile duct obstruction in rats, the entire increase in serum alkaline phosphatase activity is due to the leakage of hepatic alkaline phosphatase into serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The increased serum activity is paralleled by a striking elevation in hepatic alkaline phosphatase activity and is not accounted for by biliary retention of alkaline phosphatase.</p><p/><p>Thus, the elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase in hepatobiliary disease results from increased de novo synthesis in the liver followed by release into the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Retained bile acids appear to play a central role in this process; they induce the synthesis of the enzyme and may cause it to leak into the circulation, perhaps by disruption of hepatic organelles and solubilization of phosphatase bound to such membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The precise manner in which the alkaline phosphatase reaches the circulation is unclear. In some patients with cholestasis, small vesicles that contain many basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane enzymes still bound to these membranes, including alkaline phosphatase, have been found in serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most widely used procedure for determination of serum alkaline phosphatase activity involves measuring the release of p-nitrophenol or phosphate from p-nitrophenylphosphate under specified conditions. The results are expressed in international units <span class=\"nowrap\">(IU/L),</span> which is the activity of alkaline phosphatase that releases 1 mmol of chromogen or Pi per minute.</p><p>Alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be determined using a variety of techniques. Although the isoenzymes can be separated by electrophoresis, bone and liver isoenzymes differ only slightly in electrophoretic mobility and often overlap if run on the electrophoretic systems used in most clinical laboratories. Separation using polyacrylamide gel slabs is the most reliable method and produces clear-cut separations of the liver, bone, intestinal, and placental isoenzymes. However, this method is not always available. Electrophoresis on cellulose acetate, with the addition of heat inactivation, may accomplish the same purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A second method is based upon the observation that alkaline phosphatases from individual tissues differ in their susceptibility to inactivation by heat or 2 mol urea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Placental alkaline phosphatase and an isoenzyme found in certain cancers, the Regan isoenzyme, are fully heat-stable after exposure to a temperature of 56&deg;C for 15 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, the finding of an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase concentration in a patient in whom all the excess activity is in a heat-stable fraction strongly suggests that the placenta or a tumor is the source of the elevated enzyme in serum. Unfortunately, in nonselected patients, this method has many limitations and is not recommended.</p><p>Because none of these methods is widely available, the most practical approach is to measure other enzymes whose elevation reflects liver disease. These include 5'- nucleotidase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'5'-Nucleotidase'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical significance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major value of the serum alkaline phosphatase in the diagnosis of liver disorders is in the recognition of cholestatic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F99099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99099 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, an elevation in the alkaline phosphatase concentration is a relatively common finding and does not always indicate the presence of hepatobiliary disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78223\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78223 \">algorithm 1</a>). In addition, normal serum values of alkaline phosphatase vary based upon demographic and clinical circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 15- to 50-year age group, mean serum alkaline phosphatase activity is somewhat higher in men than in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In comparison, in individuals over age 60, the enzyme activity of women equals or exceeds that of men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, serum alkaline phosphatase activity is considerably elevated in both sexes, correlates well with the rate of bone growth, and appears to be accounted for by the influx of enzyme from osteoid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. Serum alkaline phosphatase in normal adolescent males may reach mean values three times greater than in normal adults without implying the presence of hepatobiliary disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56695\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56695 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/21,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24-26</a>]. Infants and young children occasionally display marked transient elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase activity in the absence of detectable liver or bone disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-hyperphosphatasemia-of-infancy-and-early-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transient hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients older than 60 have somewhat higher values (up to 1.5 times normal) than younger adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/22,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27</a>]. The alkaline phosphatase is usually derived from the liver in older men and from bone in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enzyme activity in serum may double late in normal pregnancy, primarily because of an influx from the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p>Identifying the source of the elevated isoenzyme is helpful if an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase is the only abnormal finding in an apparently healthy person or if the degree of elevation is higher than expected in the clinical setting. One series evaluated 317 patients in a university hospital who were evaluated for an increased serum alkaline phosphatase level: the source of elevation was the liver and bone in 80 and 18 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The remaining patients had either a mixed or an intestinal source.</p><p>If alkaline phosphatase fractionation is not available, differentiation of the source of elevation can also be accomplished by obtaining additional enzyme tests. The best studied are the serum 5'-nucleotidase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) concentrations (see below); one or the other can be obtained to evaluate an elevated alkaline phosphatase. An older test, leucine aminopeptidase, is now rarely used. These enzyme tests are not elevated in bone disorders, and leucine aminopeptidase and possibly 5'-nucleotidase are not elevated in pregnancy.</p><p>Thus, an increased serum concentration of these enzymes in nonpregnant patients indicates that an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase is due at least in part to hepatobiliary disease. However, a lack of increased serum 5'-nucleotidase in the presence of an elevated alkaline phosphatase level does <strong>not</strong> exclude liver disease because these enzymes do not necessarily increase in a parallel manner in early or modest hepatic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enzymatic-measures-of-cholestasis-eg-alkaline-phosphatase-5-nucleotidase-gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].
