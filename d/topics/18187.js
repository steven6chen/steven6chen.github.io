First described in 1975 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], more than 250 cases have now been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The majority of cases have been documented in the ophthalmology and pediatric nephrology literature via case reports and small descriptive series.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying mechanisms for TINU are not well understood. Limited data suggest that modified C-reactive protein (mCRP), an autoantigen common to both the uvea and renal tubular cells, may be involved in the pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a study of 97 patients with various renal disorders and 40 healthy controls, the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies directed against mCRP was significantly higher among nine patients with TINU syndrome (100 percent) than among those with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s associated interstitial nephritis (29 percent), drug-induced interstitial nephritis (36 percent), glomerulonephritis (5 percent), and healthy controls (0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Another study by the same group confirmed that the mCRP is higher among patients with TINU syndrome and late-onset uveitis compared with those with drug-induced interstitial nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The inflammation in TINU syndrome is thought to be T-lymphocyte driven, based upon the histologic findings. In contrast, immune cells in patients with TINU syndrome have a paradoxical suppression of cytokine production and a decrease in peripheral immune response, as demonstrated by anergy to skin testing. This paradox is not unique to TINU, as the presence of increased tissue inflammation with concomitant suppression of peripheral immunity is also seen in patients with sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS AND ASSOCIATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No identifiable risk factors have been found in at least 50 percent of cases. In some instances, prior infection or the use of specific drugs (antibiotics to treat upper respiratory infections and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) has been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. The Chinese herb, &quot;goreisan,&quot; has been associated in a case report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although causality is unclear, concurrent <em>Chlamydia</em> and Epstein-Barr virus infections have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. TINU syndrome has also been reported in patients with autoimmune diseases like hypoparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>], immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related autoimmune disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with TINU are adolescents and young women, with a median age of 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It has also been reported in adults and older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. All series report a female-to-male predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>], with no particular racial affinity.</p><p>Although sporadically reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>], there has been no definitive identified familial, genetic, or geographic clustering. In the past, various human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types have also been ascribed without inter-series consistency. Subsequently, however, a strong association was noted with HLA-DQA1*01, HLA-DQB1*05, and HLA-DQB1*01 in a series of 18 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to uveitis and interstitial nephritis, TINU may be associated with systemic findings including fever, weight loss, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, asthenia, abdominal and flank pain, arthralgias, myalgias, headache, polyuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nocturia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Uveitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with uveitis present with eye pain or redness; it is typically bilateral, although unilateral or alternating uveitis can be observed. This can also be accompanied by photophobia and decreased visual acuity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since the uveitis is predominantly anterior, the majority of clinical findings include anterior chamber cells and flare, conjunctival injection, keratic precipitates, and dry eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Posterior uveitis can also be seen, resulting in vitreous humor cells, chorioretinitis, intraretinal hemorrhages, retinal vascular sheathing, cotton wool spots, dilated retinal vessels, arteriovenous nicking, and retinal edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The uveitis has been observed to occur two months before, concurrently, and up to 14 months after the onset of the interstitial nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The majority of cases present after the onset of renal disease. In a case series cited above, among 31 patients with biopsy-proven TINU syndrome, 18 patients (58 percent) developed uveitis 2 to 11 months after a diagnosis of interstitial nephritis was made by renal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In approximately 20 percent of patients with uveitis, intraocular complications have been noted. These include posterior synechiae, optic disc swelling, cystoid macular edema, chorioretinal scar formation, cataracts, and glaucoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal manifestations with TINU syndrome are typical for acute interstitial nephritis. These may include flank pain, sterile pyuria, hematuria, proteinuria (usually subnephrotic range), renal insufficiency, and acute renal failure (ARF) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;</a>). Multiple proximal and distal tubular defects can be commonly seen, resulting in aminoaciduria, glucosuria, phosphaturia, and acidification defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

Renal sonography can demonstrate marked swelling of the kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no specific serum markers or laboratory findings that are unique to patients with TINU. Laboratory findings may include leukocyturia, eosinophilia, anemia, slightly abnormal liver function tests, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Glycosuria may be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Associations of TINU with a variety of serologic markers in the absence of their correspondent disease have been reported. Thus, the disorder has been associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; antinuclear antibody (ANA), an autoantibody directed against renal tubular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; rheumatoid factor (RF); and hypocomplementemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, antibodies that react to both tubular and uveal cells have been identified in the serum of a patient with TINU syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Elevations have been found in serum levels of beta-2 microglobulin and Krebs Von Den Lunge-6 (KL-6), a glycoprotein found in lung tissue of normal individuals as well as in the distal renal tubules of patients with TINU syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, in a larger study by the same group, serum and renal KL-6 levels were not different between patients with TINU syndrome and drug-induced interstitial nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND HISTOLOGIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitive diagnosis of TINU syndrome is nonspecific and is suggested by the combination of uveitis and renal involvement, with renal biopsy consistent with acute interstitial nephritis. On light microscopy, typical biopsy findings include tubulointerstitial edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells composed mainly of mononuclear cells, such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes. Eosinophils and noncaseating granulomas are frequently seen, with neutrophils also being observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Glomerular and vascular structures are generally preserved. Findings with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy are also nonspecific.</p><p>Patients who are determined to have acute interstitial nephritis on renal biopsy and have no obvious, underlying cause may require a slit lamp examination to exclude uveitis and TINU syndrome. However, many patients with TINU syndrome present with late-onset uveitis, and, thus, the initial slit lamp examination will be negative (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Uveitis'</a> above). Such patients who are suspected as having TINU but have a negative slit lamp examination should be followed for at least 12 months for the emergence of signs and symptoms of uveitis.</p><p>Bone marrow and lymph node granulomas can be present as well, representing the systemic nature of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for interstitial nephritis occurring in association with ocular findings is broad. Thus, the following disorders should be considered in this setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sarcoidosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic lupus erythematosus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wegener's granulomatosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, brucellosis, toxoplasmosis, and histoplasmosis</p><p/><p>Many of these disorders may present with additional ocular findings that are distinct from uveitis, as well as evidence of other organ involvement, thereby helping suggest the correct diagnosis.</p><p>However, sarcoidosis and Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome share similar findings with TINU, making accurate diagnosis difficult in the absence of characteristic involvement of other organs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-in-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease in sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It may be difficult to distinguish patients with TINU syndrome and late-onset uveitis from those with drug-induced interstitial nephritis (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Uveitis'</a> above). A high modified C-reactive protein (mCRP) may help to identify such patients. In the study cited above, among 18 patients with TINU syndrome and late-onset uveitis, compared with 61 patients with drug-induced interstitial nephritis, a high mCRP at the time of renal biopsy was an independent risk factor for the development of uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In this study, a mCRP of 20.2 percent predicted uveitis with a sensitivity and specificity of 64 and 88 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT AND PROGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal disease in patients with TINU is generally believed to be self-limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a series of 10 patients, 8 of whom had creatinine clearances of &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, renal function returned to normal levels within one year in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Although seven were administered systemic steroids for uveitis, renal function recovery was independent of such therapy or the relapse of eye disease.</p><p>However, in another series including 25 patients with TINU syndrome, 80 percent had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> by one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is not clear why patients described in this report had such poor outcomes.</p><p>Patients with progressive renal insufficiency are typically treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (typically between 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. Therapy is given for three to six months (with the duration of therapy dependent upon the response) and then slowly tapered. Most patients recover normal renal function. This regimen is similar to (but more prolonged than) therapy in acute interstitial nephritis. However, relapses are more likely to occur in TINU syndrome because of the potential immunologic basis of the disease and the lack of a possible culprit agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute interstitial nephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil has been used in a limited number of patients with acute interstitial nephritis and in one reported patient with TINU for the treatment of progressive renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

However, another study suggested that chronicity on biopsy was not correlated with prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In this study of 25 patients, the eGFR at 12 months correlated with age (r = 0.54), presence of thyroid disease (r = 0.44), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; r = 0.47), leukocyturia (r = 0.45), and serum creatinine at the time of biopsy (r = 0.44). However, no clinical, laboratory, or histologic factors were able to predict a poor outcome.</p><p>Although a few have required renal replacement therapy, even these patients can expect to only temporarily require dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tubulointerstitial-nephritis-and-uveitis-tinu-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Uveitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical and systemic corticosteroids have been used for uveitis with success.
