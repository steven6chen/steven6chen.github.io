By contrast, palliative systemic therapy is the primary approach for patients with stage IV disease. Palliative systemic therapy is also used for patients who have relapsed with advanced disease following prior definitive treatment.</p><p>For patients without a driver mutation, systemic treatment generally consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy using a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> based doublet.

Whenever possible, tumor tissue should be assessed for the presence of a somatic driver mutation (eg, mutated epidermal growth factor receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene, ROS1) which confers sensitivity to a specific inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-the-initial-management-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-without-a-driver-mutation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Tumors that lack these alterations but have &ge;50 percent of cells expressing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) may be treated with frontline immunotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-of-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-with-immune-checkpoint-inhibition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer with immune checkpoint inhibition&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If no driver mutation is present and the tumor does not have high PD-L1 expression, cytotoxic chemotherapy forms the backbone of therapy, as discussed in this topic. For those patients with a driver mutation, use of a specific inhibitor is indicated either as the initial or as therapy when progressive disease develops. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88420720\"><span class=\"h3\">Unknown mutation status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some instances, adequate tissue may not be available for genotype or PD-L1 testing or systemic treatment may be required before the results are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-the-initial-management-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-without-a-driver-mutation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In this situation, systemic therapy is based upon the assumption that no driver mutation is present. When the results of molecular profiling become available, the treatment plan should be reassessed. There are no clinical trials that directly address the optimal approach in this situation. </p><p>Even if a driver mutation is identified once chemotherapy has been started, we suggest continuing chemotherapy for four cycles as long as therapy is tolerated and there is no evidence of disease progression. Patients can then be switched to targeted therapy based upon the results of molecular studies. </p><p>The use of chemotherapy as the initial treatment for patients not selected based upon EGFR status and for those whose tumors do not contain an EGFR mutation is supported by the results of the TORCH trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-the-initial-management-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-without-a-driver-mutation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

EGFR mutation status was analyzed in 64 percent of cases; among these, 86 percent were EGFR wild type. </p><p>At a median follow-up of two years, 71 percent of patients had died. Overall survival was significantly longer in unselected patients assigned to initial chemotherapy followed by second-line <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a> (median 11.6 versus 8.7 months, hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.47). For patients known to be EGFR mutation negative, overall survival was significantly longer with initial chemotherapy (median 9.6 versus 6.5 months). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88420765\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histology provides insight into the optimal agents to combine with a platinum compound. </p><p>Regimens containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pemetrexed-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pemetrexed</a> are more effective in patients with adenocarcinoma and less effective than combinations without pemetrexed in patients with squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> is often combined with the initial chemotherapy regimen for patients with nonsquamous histology.

(See <a href=\"#H473900433\" class=\"local\">'Monoclonal antibodies targeting the VEGF pathway'</a> below.)</p><p>The impact of histology on the results with platinum based chemotherapy was illustrated by a phase III trial in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pemetrexed-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pemetrexed</a> was compared with cisplatin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> as initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-the-initial-management-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-without-a-driver-mutation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

A choice among these options takes into account patient and provider preferences, given that head-to-head comparisons of platinum combinations with either bevacizumab or pembrolizumab are not available. Although the magnitude of progression-free survival (PFS) improvement is more impressive with pembrolizumab than in the bevacizumab trials, supporting data for front-line chemotherapy and pembrolizumab come from a small randomized phase II study, and we await further survival data.
