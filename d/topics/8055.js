It is usually caused by microorganisms (predominantly bacteria) that enter the bone hematogenously. Other pathogenic mechanisms include direct inoculation (usually traumatic, but also surgical) or local invasion from a contiguous infection (eg, sinusitis, periodontal disease). Risk factors for nonhematogenous osteomyelitis include open fractures that require surgical reduction, implanted orthopedic hardware (such as pins or screws), and puncture wounds.</p><p>The management of hematogenous osteomyelitis in children will be discussed here. The epidemiology, microbiology, clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of osteomyelitis in children are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Clinical features and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264004500\"><span class=\"h1\">ONGOING DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs usually are obtained in the initial evaluation of suspected osteomyelitis. However, because plain radiographs may be normal early in the course, empiric antimicrobial therapy may be initiated before radiographic confirmation with advanced imaging studies (eg, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], scintigraphy) has been accomplished. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H17872257\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Evaluation and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Normal plain radiographs'</a>.)</p><p>For children with suspected osteomyelitis whose initial radiographs are normal, MRI or scintigraphy typically is performed within a few days to substantiate the diagnosis. If empiric antimicrobial therapy is initiated before definitive imaging studies, cultures should be obtained from blood and suspected foci of infection (if possible). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>MRI or scintigraphy also is indicated for children whose initial plain radiographs demonstrated soft tissue changes and periosteal reaction without characteristic changes in bone mineral density.
