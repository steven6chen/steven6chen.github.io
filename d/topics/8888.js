Antiviral medicines can also help prevent infection if you are exposed to the flu.</p><p>This article will discuss ways to prevent infection with influenza. The symptoms and treatment of influenza are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-symptoms-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INFLUENZA VACCINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Getting the influenza vaccine is the most effective way to reduce the chance of becoming infected with the flu. People who get the influenza vaccine have a lower chance of illness and death from influenza compared with people who are not vaccinated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-prevention-with-vaccines\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention with vaccines&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the influenza virus changes (or &quot;mutates&quot;) slightly from year to year, you need a new influenza vaccine before each flu season. People should get the flu vaccine soon after it has become available to get the most benefit.</p><p>In the northern hemisphere, the flu season usually occurs between November and April. In the southern hemisphere, the flu season usually occurs between May and October. Flu can occur at any time of year in the tropics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Effectiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who are vaccinated form antibodies (proteins), which destroy the influenza virus after the person is exposed. It generally takes about two weeks to make these antibodies. The vaccine usually protects 50 to 80 percent of those who are vaccinated from getting the flu.</p><p>If you get the flu after being vaccinated, your symptoms are likely to be milder and last for a shorter time compared with people who were not vaccinated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccine formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The flu vaccine is available in three forms in the United States, as an injection into the muscle, as an injection into the skin, and as a nasal spray.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The injection of the inactivated flu vaccine into the muscle (regular flu shot) is approved for adults and children 6 months and older in the United States. In older adults, a high-dose version of this vaccine works a little better than the standard-dose version; we prefer the high-dose vaccine for adults &ge;65 years of age when it is available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A version of the vaccine called the &quot;recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine&quot; is also approved for use in adults. It is more effective than the standard-dose inactivated vaccine for preventing influenza; however, it has not been compared directly to the high-dose vaccine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another version of the vaccine that can be injected in the muscle contains an adjuvant, which is a substance that makes the vaccine work better. The vaccine containing the adjuvant is approved for adults aged 65 years and older.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The flu vaccine can also be injected into the muscle using a jet injector device that doesn't have a needle. This device is approved for adults 18 to 64 years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The injection of flu vaccine into the skin in what is called an intradermal injection is approved for adults aged 18 to 64 years. The intradermal injection uses a smaller needle and less vaccine but works as well as the regular flu shot. It is especially useful in people who are frightened of needles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, the nasal spray vaccine is not recommended for the 2017 to 2018 influenza season.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccine side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who get the vaccine as an injection (either into muscle or skin) can have reactions at the injection site. Intramuscular injections can cause redness, swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> soreness at the site. Intradermal injections can cause redness, swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> itching. The high-dose intramuscular vaccine and the intradermal vaccine are more likely to cause local reactions than the standard-dose intramuscular vaccine.</p><p>Other possible side effects of these vaccines include body aches, headache, and a low-grade fever (usually less than 100.4&ordm;F or 38&ordm;C). These problems are usually mild and go away within a day or two.</p><p>Many people are concerned about the safety of vaccines. But for most people, the risk of complications from the vaccine is much smaller than the risk of complications from being infected with the flu. While no vaccine is 100 percent safe for everyone, the flu vaccine appears to be low risk. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The flu vaccine is less likely than the flu itself to increase the risk of a nervous system disorder called Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no evidence that the flu vaccine increases the risk of birth defects or miscarriage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some formulations of the flu vaccine contain a preservative called thimerosal, which is derived from mercury. However, there is no convincing evidence that the small amount of thimerosal in this vaccine will be harmful to children, pregnant women, or adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=why-does-my-child-need-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several groups, including the <a href=\"http://vaers.hhs.gov/&amp;token=dJuRidyjQYZxq9fkueW6q/tu74Gc4Bozwqj1sfo1o5g=&amp;TOPIC_ID=3992\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Vaccine Adverse Event Report System (VAERS)</a>, monitor the reports of vaccine side effects closely.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">WHO SHOULD BE VACCINATED?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The flu vaccine is recommended for nearly all people six months of age and older. The vaccine is especially important for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults age 50 or older.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who live in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults and children who have chronic lung or heart conditions. This includes children with asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults and children with chronic diseases, such as diabetes or kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults and children with HIV infection or who have received organ or stem cell transplants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and teenagers age 6 months to 18 years who are taking long-term aspirin therapy and might be at risk for Reye syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who will be pregnant during the influenza season.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults and children who might transmit influenza to high-risk individuals (including people listed above). This includes healthcare workers, workers in nursing homes, home health workers, and people who live with a high-risk individual.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4173187471\"><span class=\"h2\">What if I have an egg allergy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have an egg allergy, you should still get the flu vaccine every year. People sometimes worry about this because some forms of the vaccine contain small amounts of egg protein; however, the amount present in vaccines today is so small that it does not cause an allergic reaction, even in people with severe egg allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIVIRAL MEDICINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiviral medicines can help to reduce the chances of developing the flu after being exposed to someone who is infected. These medicines can also be used in certain people who are at risk for developing complications from the flu and who cannot receive the flu vaccine.</p><p>The &quot;best&quot; medicine depends on the strain of influenza circulating in the community.
