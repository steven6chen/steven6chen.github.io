The cumulative data indicate that over 70 percent of patients experience recurrent variceal hemorrhage within one year of their index bleeding episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The risk of rebleeding is greatest immediately after cessation of active bleeding and then declines, reaching close to baseline values by six weeks. Approximately 70 percent of all untreated patients die within the first year after their initial variceal hemorrhage. The causes of death include recurrent variceal hemorrhage, liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and progressive ascites and infections.</p><p>These data underscore the importance of preventing recurrent hemorrhage, sustaining liver function, maintaining an ascites-free state, and avoiding infections to achieve prolonged survival. At this time, orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) is the only treatment that achieves all of these objectives and prolongs long-term survival with any degree of certainty. However, some patients are not suitable subjects for liver transplants and, even when OLT is being considered, patients often have to wait several months before an organ becomes available. During this time, they are at risk for recurrent variceal hemorrhage and therefore require treatment to prevent this complication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-patient-selection-and-pretransplantation-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Patient selection and pretransplantation evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ideal treatment would be one that is universally effective, safe, freely available, easy to administer and inexpensive. Because such a treatment does not exist, the choice of a given modality of treatment over another involves consideration of its relative efficacy and safety, availability, and cost considerations. The major options are endoscopic sclerotherapy, endoscopic band ligation, pharmacologic therapy with beta blockers and oral nitrates, insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and surgery.</p><p>This topic with will review the options for preventing recurrent variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis. The treatment of acute variceal hemorrhage is discussed elsewhere.

The approaches recommended by the guidelines (nonselective beta blockers, endoscopic variceal ligation, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, and liver transplantation), as well as other options for the prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding, are discussed in detail below. The recommendations in the AASLD guidelines are similar to those in a 2015 international consensus statement (Baveno VI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and in 2015 guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.bsg.org.uk/clinical-guidelines/liver/uk-guidelines-for-the-management-of-variceal-haemorrhage-in-cirrhotic-patients.html&amp;token=kH0vUEzkCX1izzUzwxDanTaPuKAL0f2/Z2DxAKj6OGoY+1EWlhOCdFdk7mn7QsWH8EDDpOpXBIvn0F/6spCxGZV6/eYeZ+CeaKm5slHofOpRkNEZgrdq0KLlHjka0oNEZXTVjfhCv3tM4QYJEFfNOA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=1252\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">British Society of Gastroenterology</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The AASLD recommends:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cirrhosis who survive an episode of active variceal hemorrhage should receive therapy to prevent recurrence of variceal hemorrhage (secondary prophylaxis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination of nonselective beta blockers plus endoscopic variceal ligation is the best option for secondary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nonselective beta blocker should be adjusted to the maximal tolerated dose.

In the past, it was extensively evaluated for the long-term prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage. Compared with placebo, it decreases both the risk of rebleeding (40 to 50 percent versus 70 percent) and death (30 to 60 percent versus 50 to 75 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68177\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68177 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. However, it remains controversial whether these effects represent the benefits of repeated episodes of sclerotherapy or the beneficial effects of sclerotherapy for episodes of active hemorrhage. Only esophageal varices and gastric varices in direct continuity with esophageal varices are treatable by endoscopic sclerotherapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70339968\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique and complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injection of the sclerosing agent causes necrosis of esophageal tissues and mucosal ulcers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71037\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71037 \">table 2</a>). Small ulcers appear within the first few days in most patients and larger ulcers develop in approximately 50 percent. Many patients have transient retrosternal discomfort. Patients who develop large ulcers are at risk for bleeding, delays in scheduled sclerotherapy treatments, and the development of strictures weeks to months later. Esophageal perforation is a rare complication.</p><p>The incidence of symptomatic strictures varies from series to series, with 15 percent being a representative figure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Postsclerotherapy treatment with a proton pump inhibitor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> has been tried, but its efficacy in preventing ulcers and strictures is unproven. In one randomized trial, omeprazole was no more effective than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Both intravariceal injections and paravariceal injections have been associated with equally good outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The outcomes are also similar regardless of the type of sclerosant used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], the volume injected, or frequency of sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The frequency of complications increases when sclerotherapy is performed weekly, while injections at two- to three-week intervals take longer to achieve variceal obliteration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Most episodes of recurrent hemorrhage occur before variceal obliteration is achieved. Once varices are obliterated, there is a risk of recurrence over time, necessitating surveillance endoscopy every six months for the first year and annually thereafter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70339974\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOSCOPIC BAND LIGATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic band ligation was developed as an alternative to sclerotherapy. It is performed by attachment of a device loaded with rubber bands to the tip of the endoscope. A varix is suctioned into the device using the suction channel of the endoscope and then the rubber band is deployed around the base of the varix by pulling on a trip wire, which releases the rubber band. Devices that are loaded with 6 and 10 rubber bands are now commercially available. Small varices are often difficult to suction into the banding device and are not optimal for this procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-variceal-ligation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic variceal ligation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70339980\"><span class=\"h2\">Band ligation versus sclerotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have evaluated the relative efficacy of band ligation versus sclerotherapy for the management of variceal hemorrhage. A meta-analysis indicated that, compared with sclerotherapy, ligation reduced the rebleeding rate (odds ratio 0.52), the mortality rate (odds ratio 0.67), the rate of death due to rebleeding (odds ratio 0.49), and the development of esophageal strictures (odds ratio 0.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Variceal obliteration was achieved in similar proportions with both techniques, but the number of treatments necessary to achieve obliteration was lower with ligation. In view of these data, band ligation is the initial procedure of choice for prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage. This is supported by the American College of Gastroenterology Practice Parameters Committee, which recommends band ligation as the endoscopic treatment of choice for the long-term management of variceal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70339986\"><span class=\"h2\">Band ligation plus sclerotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies evaluating combination therapy for esophageal varices have produced heterogeneous results, depending in part upon the population that is studied (ie, active bleeding versus prior bleeding). Considering the available data, it appears that combining initial variceal band ligation with a session of sclerotherapy used for small residual varices could offer the benefit of reducing variceal recurrence while minimizing complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, such a practice has not evolved to be routine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-variceal-ligation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic variceal ligation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-variceal-ligation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic variceal ligation&quot;, section on 'Combination therapy'</a>.)</p><p>After a mean follow-up of two years, recurrent esophageal varices and variceal bleeding were significantly less common in patients treated with combined therapy (14 versus 43 percent and 8 versus 31 percent, respectively). One patient treated with band ligation alone developed an esophageal stricture.</p><p>In contrast to these findings, most studies using strategies in which variceal ligation was combined with sclerotherapy during initial variceal obliteration have demonstrated decreased efficacy and a higher complication rate compared with band ligation alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-variceal-ligation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic variceal ligation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70339992\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of the pharmacologic prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage have focused on the use of beta blockers, although other drugs have also been studied.

For these reasons, they are the treatment of choice for primary prophylaxis in patients at high risk for variceal bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary and pre-primary prophylaxis against variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Multiple clinical trials have compared beta blockers with placebo for the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/22-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-32</a>].<strong> </strong>Approximately 75 percent of the patients enrolled had Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 3</a>). Alcohol was the most common cause of liver disease and many patients were excluded from participation due to contraindications to use of beta blockers. The most important variation among studies was the timing of entry into the studies from the index bleed (one day to one month). The doses of the drug used were also variable (10 to 480 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>); the dose was generally titrated to achieve a 25 percent decrease in resting heart rate.</p><p>With a few exceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31</a>], an overall improvement in rebleeding rate was noted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70811 \">figure 1</a>),<strong> </strong>but a survival advantage was only shown in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Meta-analysis of these data suggests that the risk of bleeding is decreased by approximately 40 percent, while the risk of death is decreased by 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propranolol</a> has also decreased recurrent bleeding (35 versus 62 percent at one year) from portal hypertensive gastropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portal-hypertensive-gastropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portal hypertensive gastropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of a hepatoma, poor compliance, and continued alcohol use are risk factors for recurrence of variceal hemorrhage in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although acute hemodynamic changes after initiation of propranolol does not predict long-term outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], the presence of a sustained portal hypotensive effect at one month after initiation of therapy appears to be an important predictive factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Thus, measurement of portal hemodynamics may be an important prognostic element of treatment. One study prospectively evaluated 69 patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> after an episode of variceal bleeding and measured the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) before and at three months. The HPVG fell by 20 percent or more in 25 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. During follow-up of 28 months, rebleeding was much less likely in these patients compared with patients who had lesser reductions in HVPG (8 versus 52 percent). Despite these encouraging data, the facilities for routine measurement of portal pressures are not widely available and the cost-effectiveness of portal pressure measurement for guidance of medical therapy appears to depend largely upon local costs, life expectancy, and rebleeding rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. These considerations have precluded its widespread use for this purpose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5066642\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta blockers are associated with numerous side effects (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of beta blockers&quot;</a>). In patients with cirrhosis, the most clinically important adverse effects include bronchoconstriction, heart failure, and impotence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Beta blockers rarely induce liver failure from decreased portal blood flow because total hepatic blood flow is usually maintained by an increase in hepatic arterial flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Despite the inability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a> to cross the blood brain barrier due to its hydrophilic nature (in contrast to the highly lipophilic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>), central nervous system side effects of the two medications do not differ.</p><p>The safety of beta blockers in patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites has been called into question, and beta blockers should be used cautiously in this group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Beta blockers should be discontinued if a patient develops a systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg, hyponatremia (&lt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> severe alcoholic hepatitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or acute kidney injury, provided there are no alternative causes identified (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use or diuretic use). Reinitiation of beta blockers could be performed on a case-by-case basis after careful consideration if there was a clear precipitant for the changes, but the evidence regarding this is unclear. If discontinued, alternative methods for variceal bleeding prevention (banding) should be initiated.</p><p>In a prospective study of 151 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites, median survival was significantly longer in patients who did not receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> versus those who did (20 versus 5 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Independent predictors of mortality were Child-Pugh class C, hyponatremia, refractory ascites due to renal failure, and beta blocker therapy. </p><p>Whether the beta blockers accounted for the increased mortality is uncertain, since the study was not randomized. In particular, patients who did not receive the beta blockers appeared to be less likely to have varices and to be sicker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In addition, approximately two-thirds of the deaths on beta blockers were due to hepatocellular cancer (HCC) or sepsis, and there is no clear pathogenic basis for beta blockers in HCC. </p><p>It has been theorized that one way in which beta blockers may lead to increased mortality among patients with advanced cirrhosis is by reducing cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This is important because low mean arterial blood pressure is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with advanced cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] and because reduced cardiac output is a strong predictor of hepatorenal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. If the increased mortality in this study was in fact due to beta blocker use, a possible explanation for the increased mortality is that the beta blockers may have precipitated hepatorenal syndrome. In addition, many of the patients died from complications related to <span class=\"nowrap\">sepsis/spontaneous</span> bacterial peritonitis. In such patients, the decreased cardiac output related to beta blockade may have compounded the hypotension related to vasodilation from sepsis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis#H145979036\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Decompensated cirrhosis'</a>.)</p><p>However, results from other studies have found no increased mortality in those receiving beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. A retrospective study included 194 patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites who did not have a history of variceal hemorrhage. Varices were present in 132 patients (68 percent). Predictors of decreased survival included higher Child-Pugh scores (hazard ratio [HR] 1.2) and the presence of varices (HR 1.2). Beta blocker use was not associated with decreased survival. However, the study was not limited to patients with refractory ascites, so whether the results apply to such patients is unclear.</p><p>Since infection is a major cause of death in patients with cirrhosis, one study looked to see if there was an association of nonselective beta-blocker use with serious infections. The case-control study using data from the United States Veterans Health Administration compared patients with cirrhosis (both compensated and decompensated) who used nonselective beta-blockers with a matched group of patients with cirrhosis who did not use nonselective beta-blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

The heterogeneity of these studies limits their direct comparison. The studies varied in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sclerotherapy protocols used</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of liver failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient randomization </p><p/><p>While most studies randomized patients within 24 hours of admission, one trial that found no benefit with TIPS, focused primarily on long-term rebleeding and randomized patients after a mean of 10 days compared with one to two days in the other reports [101]. The timing issue may be important since it has been suggested that TIPS is significantly better than sclerotherapy in preventing rebleeding only when it is performed less than one week after the initial hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Most studies demonstrated a significant decrease in the risk of rebleeding in patients undergoing TIPS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52679 \">figure 3</a>).The differences across studies were due to the variable rebleeding rates after endoscopic treatment rather than after TIPS (which was approximately 20 percent). Despite the beneficial effects on bleeding, TIPS was associated with either no survival advantage or poorer survival in most of the studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73392 \">figure 4</a>). In addition, hepatic encephalopathy occurred at least twice as frequently following TIPS in most of the studies. Advanced age, liver failure, shunt fraction (shunt diameter) and a history of encephalopathy prior to TIPS are all risk factors for worsening encephalopathy after TIPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. </p><p>A meta-analysis of 11 controlled trials with a total of 811 patients concluded that, compared with endoscopic treatment, TIPS reduced the rate of rebleeding but did not improve overall survival, and increased the incidence of encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

One trial compared TIPS to medical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endoscopic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The study included 91 patients (Child-Pugh class B or C) who were randomly assigned to medical therapy (with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate) or TIPS following an initial episode of variceal bleeding. Patients who did not tolerate propranolol underwent endoscopic treatment. Those who had previously failed pharmacologic therapy received both pharmacologic therapy and endoscopic treatment. The following observations were made during two years of follow-up:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The probability of rebleeding was significantly lower in the TIPS group (49 versus 13 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar number of reinterventions were required in both groups (angioplasty <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> restenting in the TIPS group or repeat endoscopic therapy in the medical therapy group)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encephalopathy was more frequent in the TIPS group (38 versus 14 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Child-Pugh class improved significantly more often in the medical therapy group (72 versus 45 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The probability of survival was identical (72 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIPS was twice as expensive as medical therapy</p><p/><p>A second trial included 63 patients with Child's B or C cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding who were treated with vasoactive drugs and endoscopic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. The patients were assigned to either early TIPS (within 72 hours of randomization) or treatment with a nonselective beta blocker and long-term endoscopic band ligation. The patients were followed for a median of 16 months. Patients who underwent early TIPS had significantly higher rates of remaining free from rebleeding (97 versus 50 percent) and higher one-year survival (86 versus 61 percent). There were no significant differences noted between the groups with regard to serious adverse events.</p><p>Considering the above data, the superiority of TIPS for prevention of rebleeding is offset by its failure to consistently improve survival and increasing morbidity due to the development of liver failure and encephalopathy. For these reasons, TIPS is used primarily as a salvage therapy for those with recurrent bleeding despite an adequate trial of endoscopic and pharmacologic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The precise definition of &quot;failure of endoscopic treatment&quot; remains controversial; we consider failure to be the recurrence of variceal hemorrhage despite at least two sessions of endoscopic treatment performed no more than two weeks apart. However, there is growing acceptance of early TIPS to reduce rebleeding rates, particularly in patients with preserved liver function.</p><p>Whether there are subsets of patients in whom the balance would favor TIPS is still being clarified. One study suggested a benefit of TIPS in a subset of patients with an elevated hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) following an episode of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Patients with active variceal bleeding were managed by band ligation and then underwent hepatic venous pressure measurement within the first 24 hours. Those with an HVPG &gt;20 mmHg were randomly assigned to continue medical therapy or undergo urgent TIPS. In this setting, TIPS was dramatically superior to medical treatment. This study highlights the issue of timing of intervention in the overall efficacy of specific interventions for variceal bleeding. Additional studies are now required to validate the role of portal pressure measurement to guide the need for TIPS early after admission for bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70340040\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrence of portal hypertension and stent stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal cause of rebleeding after TIPS is the recurrence of portal hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53289\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53289 \">table 4</a>).

The incidence of TIPS stenosis has been dramatically reduced by the introduction of covered stents for TIPS.</p><p/><p>With the introduction of coated stents, the risk of stent stenosis has been dramatically reduced and the shunt patency rates are substantially better than those with uncoated stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

Several other factors have also contributed to this decline:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The multitude of operations available and the degree of skill required to perform each one has left only a limited number of surgeons who consistently obtain outcomes comparable to those from centers in which these operations were developed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several major randomized studies have shown that survival outcome after sclerotherapy is equal to or superior to those obtained with surgery.

A previously placed TIPS can be easily removed with the explant at the time of transplant in most instances; in occasional patients, however, the stent extends into the right atrium or superior mesenteric veins, rendering the surgery much more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p>Survival figures range from 80 to 90 percent at one year to 60 percent at five years after OLT.

This is related both to the increasing use of TIPS and liver transplantation. As a result, the number of surgeons who are experienced in shunt operations, especially the distal splenorenal shunt (Warren shunt) has decreased. Thus, shunt operations (particularly the Warren shunt, which is technically challenging) cannot be recommended unless a surgeon is available who has demonstrated consistently favorable outcomes.</p><p>Although shunt operations continue to have a role in selected patients (at centers with appropriate surgical expertise), we prefer to use TIPS, especially since the long term patency problems with uncoated stents can be largely obviated by the use of coated stents. All TIPS should be performed with covered stents.

For patients with decompensated cirrhosis (eg, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) we have a high threshold for <span class=\"nowrap\">starting/resuming</span> beta blockers due to evidence suggesting increased mortality in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H70339974\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic band ligation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H70340004\" class=\"local\">'Beta blockers plus band ligation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5066642\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For primary prophylaxis, our practice is to give beta blockers to patients with compensated cirrhosis and large varices (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary and pre-primary prophylaxis against variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;, section on 'Nonselective beta blockers'</a>). If they subsequently bleed, we band aggressively until the varices are obliterated. If the patient is otherwise compensated, we also resume beta blockers at the time of discharge from the hospital, but have a low threshold for stopping them. Patients with refractory ascites may have worse outcomes if placed on beta blockers, and beta blockers should be used with caution in this group of patients. (See <a href=\"#H5066642\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical portal decompression may be an option for patients with Child class A cirrhosis provided that the appropriate surgical expertise is available. (See <a href=\"#H70340046\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that patients with liver failure undergo evaluation for liver transplantation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-patient-selection-and-pretransplantation-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Patient selection and pretransplantation evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acute variceal bleeding despite adequate band ligation and beta blockers, we recommend either transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts or surgery as a bridge to transplantation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The choice of procedure should be individualized based upon the patient's condition and available expertise. (See <a href=\"#H70340034\" class=\"local\">'Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts'</a> above and <a href=\"#H70340046\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other approaches have also been proposed based upon measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient and may be equally valid as the approach outlined above.
