While viral, fungal, and mycoplasma pneumonias and tuberculosis can lead to pleural effusions, many parapneumonic effusions are associated with bacterial infections. The effusion results from the spread of inflammation and infection to the pleura. Much less commonly, infections in other adjacent areas (eg, retropharyngeal, vertebral, abdominal, and retroperitoneal spaces) may spread to the pleura resulting in an effusion. Parapneumonic effusions are seen in approximately 2 to 12 percent of children with pneumonia and up to 28 percent of those requiring hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Early in the course of parapneumonic effusion, the pleura becomes inflamed; subsequent leakage of proteins, fluid, and leukocytes into the pleural space forms the effusion. In the early stage, the pleural effusion is usually sterile with a low leukocyte count. With time, the effusion can become thick and fibrotic, and bacteria can invade the fluid, resulting in empyema. The risk for developing a true empyema is determined by a balance between host resistance, bacterial virulence, and timing of presentation for medical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and evaluation of parapneumonic effusion and empyema in children will be reviewed here. The management of parapneumonic effusion and empyema in children is discussed elsewhere.

After the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in the United States in 2000, admission rates for pneumococcal pneumonia decreased, but those for pneumococcal empyema continued to increase, probably because PCV7 does not cover several virulent pneumococcal serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

If a moderate or large effusion is seen on chest radiograph, and especially if the effusion appears non-free-flowing, then ultrasonography is indicated to more accurately determine the size of the effusion, characterize the nature of the fluid, and evaluate for septations and loculation. Computed tomography (CT) is not routinely necessary in the evaluation of children with parapneumonic <span class=\"nowrap\">effusion/empyema,</span> and its use is generally limited to cases in which there is clinical suspicion for lung necrosis or abscess formation or to rule out other causes for effusion, if clinically indicated. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posteroanterior (PA) or anteroposterior (AP) and lateral decubitus radiographs can help in making the diagnosis of pleural effusion and in determining the need for thoracentesis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest-tube placement. A decubitus or cross-table view permits free fluid to layer out on the dependent chest wall and can help to distinguish fluid from pleural thickening. In older children and adults, a decubitus layer of &gt;1 cm is considered sufficient volume to enable extraction of fluid by thoracentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,61</a>].

However, they sometimes help to distinguish between free fluid and loculated effusion. A free-flowing effusion should layer with gravity, as noted on the right lateral decubitus view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51660\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51660 \">image 1</a>). By contrast, a loculated effusion will not be affected by gravity and will not be seen to layer on a decubitus chest radiograph. Of note, the <span class=\"nowrap\">loculations/septations</span> themselves cannot be seen on plain radiograph. In general, ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice to make this distinction. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasonography'</a> below.)</p><p>Radiographic signs of pleural effusion include obliteration of the costophrenic angle, the &quot;meniscus sign&quot; (a rim of fluid ascending the lateral chest wall), and scoliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], particularly in patients with illness of more than one week's duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Air-fluid levels in the pleural space suggest the presence of gas-forming organisms, pneumothorax, perforated viscus, or bronchopleural fistula. On the PA view, opacification of more than one-quarter but less than one-half of the thorax suggests a moderate sized effusion, and opacification of more than one-half of the thorax suggests a large effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

If the radiograph shows opacity of the entire hemithorax (&quot;whiteout&quot;), then it is difficult to know whether this is caused by fluid, consolidation within the lung, or extrapulmonary mass. Ultrasonography can help to make that differentiation. Patients with severe respiratory distress or deviation of the trachea away from the involved lung (mediastinal shift) are likely to have a large pleural effusion, and should be evaluated and treated urgently. </p><p>Chest radiographs also may reveal other findings that help to distinguish parapneumonic effusions from other causes of pleural effusion, such as heart failure (cardiomegaly) and malignancy (lymphadenopathy or bone lesions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in the evaluation of patients with moderate to large parapneumonic pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

In particular, the presence of septations, cellular debris, and the lack of free movement with gravity suggest a complicated (fibrinopurulent) effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82208\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82208 \">image 2</a>). In addition, ultrasonography can identify optimal sites for thoracentesis or chest tube insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>]. Ultrasonography is superior to CT because of better accuracy in detecting early loculations and septations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Other advantages of ultrasonography compared with CT include its ready availability, lack of radiation exposure, and lack of need for sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

If a broad-range PCR is not available, specific testing should be done for <em>S. pneumoniae</em> (pneumococcus) and <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>.

Moreover, PCR results have limited value in determining antibiotic treatment choices because most laboratories do not also assess the pleural fluid for evidence of antibiotic resistance genes and thus do not provide information about antibiotic resistance in the identified strain of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> or <em>S. aureus</em>. This is not a concern for Group A streptococcus because isolates are all susceptible to penicillin.
