While the absolute growth rate of bariatric surgery in Asia was 449 percent between 2005 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], the number of procedures performed in the United States appears to have plateaued at approximately 200,000 operations per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The plateau may be a result of several factors, such as the multidisciplinary team identification of patients who can be effectively managed with behavior modification or a comprehensive evaluation that may identify patients who are not ideal surgical candidates. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2961899\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERALL MECHANISM OF WEIGHT LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bariatric surgical procedures affect weight loss through two fundamental mechanisms: malabsorption and restriction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59447\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59447 \">table 1</a>). Some procedures have both a restrictive and malabsorptive component. There is also growing recognition that bariatric surgical procedures contribute to neurohormonal effects on the regulation of energy balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/1,7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2961905\"><span class=\"h2\">Restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restrictive procedures limit caloric intake by reducing the stomach's reservoir capacity via resection, bypass, or creation of a proximal gastric outlet. Vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) are purely restrictive procedures and share similar anatomical configurations. Both limit solid food intake by restriction of stomach size as the only mechanism of action, leaving the absorptive function of the small intestine intact. These procedures have largely been abandoned. The sleeve gastrectomy has become the main restrictive procedure, but it is probably more successful due to its effects on hunger control. Investigational procedures, such as intragastric balloon placement or aspiration therapy, also work by restricting food intake but produce more gradual and modest weight loss compared with other contemporary surgical procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2961911\"><span class=\"h2\">Malabsorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malabsorptive procedures decrease the effectiveness of nutrient absorption by shortening the length of the functional small intestine, either through bypass of the small bowel absorptive surface area or diversion of the biliopancreatic secretions that facilitate absorption. Jejunoileal bypass (JIB) and the biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) are examples of malabsorptive procedures. Profound weight loss can be achieved by a malabsorptive operation, depending upon the effective length of the functional small bowel segment. However, the benefit of superior weight loss can be offset by significant metabolic complications, such as protein calorie malnutrition and various micronutrient deficiencies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2961917\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination of restriction and malabsorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and BPD with duodenal switch <span class=\"nowrap\">(BPD/DS)</span> are both restrictive and malabsorptive. In the RYGB, a small gastric pouch limits oral intake. However, the small bowel reconfiguration provides additional mechanisms favoring weight loss, including dumping physiology, positive hormonal changes, and mild malabsorption. There is an effect on hunger as well, likely due to the hormonal changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16056874\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTEMPORARY PROCEDURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205574861\"><span class=\"h2\">Roux-en-Y gastric bypass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52350\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52350 \">figure 1</a>) remains one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedures. Global trends show an overall decline from approximately 65 percent in 2003 to 47 percent in 2011 of all bariatric procedures performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/2,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14-17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16055616\"><span class=\"h3\">Description of RYGB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The RYGB is characterized by a small (less than 30 mL) proximal gastric pouch that is divided and separated from the distal stomach and anastomosed to a Roux limb of small bowel that is 75 to 150 cm in length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79256\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79256 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. The small gastric pouch and the narrow anastomotic outlet serve to restrict caloric intake, while the major digestion and absorption of nutrients occur in the common channel where gastric acid, pepsin, intrinsic factor, pancreatic enzymes, and bile mix with ingested food (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70745\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70745 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>The small intestine is divided at a distance of 30 to 50 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. By dividing the bowel, the surgeon creates a proximal biliopancreatic limb that transports the secretions from the gastric remnant, liver, and pancreas. The Roux limb (or alimentary limb) is anastomosed to the new gastric pouch and functions to drain consumed food. The cut ends of the biliopancreatic limb and the Roux limb are then connected 75 to 150 cm distally from the gastrojejunostomy. Major digestion and absorption of nutrients then occurs in the resultant common channel where pancreatic enzymes and bile mix with ingested food.</p><p>The laparoscopic approach to an RYGB can be found at the following link to the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) video library's page on <a href=\"https://www.sages.org/video/sages-top-14-part-13-laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass/&amp;token=9vw/C6uSotNfSBaSbGGNJuFIHisRCuji0IdkIUp75xF6V4MjY3bzX5S8FkBZjdpIkAATQlCrJJYu27wI0vqvHH2AUXEgr7JIoGAZrqjnOE9TCvh3pwFbHPx4x1c4mAB2&amp;TOPIC_ID=88536\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass</a>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205574868\"><span class=\"h3\">Weight loss mechanism RYGB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the RYGB, with its small pouch, is primarily a restrictive operation, a malabsorptive component also contributes to weight loss. RYGB has been shown repeatedly to be better than purely restrictive procedures, such as the vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG), in long-term weight reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other mechanisms, such as dumping syndrome, Roux limb length, and gut hormones, may have a role in the weight loss seen following gastric bypass:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrojejunostomy anatomy (connection between the stomach pouch and jejunum) is associated with dumping physiology and causes unpleasant symptoms of lightheadedness, nausea, diaphoresis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal pain, and diarrhea when a high-sugar meal is ingested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This response may serve as a negative conditioning response against consumption of a high-sugar diet postoperatively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal length of the Roux limb in achieving the best balance between weight reduction and complications of malabsorption is controversial. Increasing Roux limb length can lead to increased malabsorption, since lengthening the Roux limb effectively shortens the common channel limb where major digestion and absorption of the ingested nutrients occur. At present, most surgeons do not make the Roux length longer than 150 cm. Distal gastric bypass with a short common channel has been used to treat patients with inadequate weight loss following standard RYGB, but the risk for metabolic complications increases similar to other malabsorptive operations, and weight loss results vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ghrelin is a peptide hormone secreted in the foregut (stomach and duodenum) that stimulates the early phase of meal consumption. The normal pulsatile release of this orexigenic (appetite-producing) hormone appears to be inhibited in gastric bypass patients due to its unique foregut bypass configuration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Such inhibition of ghrelin has also been observed in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The reduced ghrelin levels may contribute to the characteristic loss of appetite seen in post-RYGB patients. An exaggerated response of peptide YY (PYY) may also contribute to the loss of appetite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The SG is technically easier to perform and viewed as &quot;not as drastic&quot; by patients. In 2016, it was the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in the world and in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1412270440\"><span class=\"h3\">Description of SG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SG is technically easier to perform than the RYGB, as it does not require multiple anastomoses. It is also safer, as it reduces the risks of internal herniation and protein and mineral malabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The antrum is divided approximately 2 to 6 cm away from the pylorus, and a sleeve is created around a 32- to 40-French bougie [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The tubular stomach is small in its capacity (restriction), resistant to stretching due to the absence of the fundus, and has few ghrelin-producing cells (a gut hormone involved in regulating food intake). Although SG is a restrictive procedure, gastric motility changes also occur with surgery and may affect weight loss outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

Some surgeons perform this procedure for super morbidly obese patients (BMI &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> while others reserve it as a revisional procedure for failure to lose weight or weight recidivism after other procedures. BPD results in fat and starch malabsorption. Its use has been limited by the high rates of protein malnutrition, anemia, diarrhea, and stomal ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/22,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,40</a>]. Because <span class=\"nowrap\">BPD/DS</span> is a technically difficult operation with a high complication rate, it has not been fully embraced as a bariatric procedure.

The distal ileum is then anastomosed to the stomach and the proximal ileum, with the output from the liver, pancreas, and duodenum (or biliopancreatic limb) anastomosed to the terminal ileum some 50 to 100 cm away from the ileocecal valve. The BPD with a DS procedure involves creating a sleeve gastrectomy with preservation of the pylorus and creation of a Roux limb with a short common channel. The <span class=\"nowrap\">BPD/DS</span> procedure differs from the BPD in the portion of the stomach that is removed, as well as in the preservation of the pylorus, similar to an SG. This allows more forward flow of the contents of the biliopancreatic limb and avoids the complications of stasis that plagued the jejunoileal bypass (JIB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

Many patients have been able to sustain durable weight loss and comorbidity resolution with proper use and maintenance of the band. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16057219\"><span class=\"h2\">Jejunoileal bypass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The jejunoileal bypass (JIB) was one of the first bariatric operations, performed initially in 1969 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53171\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53171 \">figure 11</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. It has since been abandoned due to the high complication rate and frequent need for revisional surgery. Its importance lies in the care of surviving patients who have undergone this procedure. Although excess weight loss was excellent, jejunoileal bypass was associated with multiple complications, such as liver failure (up to 30 percent), death, diarrhea, electrolyte imbalances, oxalate renal stones, vitamin deficiencies, malnutrition, and arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/88-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">88-92</a>].</p><p>The procedure was performed by dividing the jejunum close to the ligament of Treitz and connecting it a short distance proximal to the ileocecal valve, thereby diverting a long segment of small bowel, resulting in malabsorption.</p><p>Patients who have undergone this procedure should be monitored closely for complications (particularly liver disease) and undergo reversal if such complications arise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late complications of bariatric surgical operations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16057018\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastroplasties</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A gastroplasty narrows the area of food passage between the proximal and the distal stomach. This procedure did not result in significant weight loss, and the vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) was subsequently created to put a more permanent restrictive barrier between the proximal and distal stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>VBG is a purely restrictive procedure in which the upper part of the stomach is partitioned by a vertical staple line with a tight outlet wrapped by a prosthetic mesh or band (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57137\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57137 \">figure 12</a>). The small upper stomach pouch is filled quickly by solid food and prevents consumption of a large meal. Weight loss occurs because of decreased caloric intake of solid food. Patients who have undergone VBG can be expected to have excess weight loss (EWL) of 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. The effectiveness of such a restrictive mechanism depends upon the durability of pouch and stoma (outlet) size. Ingestion of high-calorie liquid meals and gradually increased pouch capacity due to overeating have been some of the major causes of its failure. Sweets eaters who rely on soft meals (ie, ice cream, milk shakes) do not benefit significantly from this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>VBG has been replaced largely by other procedures and is rarely performed due to lack of <span class=\"nowrap\">sustained/desired</span> weight loss as well as the high incidence of complications requiring revision (20 to 56 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/18,94-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,94-98</a>]. The majority of revisions are required for staple line disruption, stomal stenosis, band erosion, band disruption, pouch dilatation, vomiting, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2003 through 2008 documented that the proportion of laparoscopic bariatric operations increased from 20 percent in 2003 to 90 percent in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Minimally invasive techniques were first applied in bariatric surgery in the 1990s. The first laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) series was reported in 1994 in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Although technically challenging with a steep learning curve, laparoscopic RYGB can be performed safely by experienced surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>]. The laparoscopic approach offers several advantages, such as reduced blood loss, lower incidence of incisional hernia, wound infection, faster recovery, and a shorter hospital stay than with open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/102-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">102-104</a>]. Although the procedure can be limited by patient size, as well as instrument and trocar length, even extremely large patients have been successfully completed laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].
