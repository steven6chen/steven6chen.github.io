The prevalence of the full mutation in females is approximately two-thirds to one-half of that in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fragile-x-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The premutation carrier rate is approximately 1 in 750 to 1 in 850 men and 1 in 250 to 1 in 300 in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fragile-x-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5</a>]. FXS has been diagnosed in up to 3 percent of boys with significant neurodevelopmental disorders (eg, autism, nonsyndromic intellectual disability) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fragile-x-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FXS is an X-linked disorder. It is caused by decreased or absent levels of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) due to a loss-of-function mutation in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (<em>FMR1</em>) gene, located at Xq27.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fragile-x-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In more than 99 percent of cases, loss of function is caused by an unstable expansion of a trinucleotide (cytosine-guanine-guanine, CGG) repeat at the 5' untranslated region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fragile-x-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. Deletions, point mutations, and missense mutation in <em>FMR1</em> also may cause FXS but are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fragile-x-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,11</a>].</p><p>There are two clinically significant levels of CGG expansion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expansion of &gt;200 repeats is known as full mutation and leads to methylation-coupled silencing of the <em>FMR1</em> gene and absence of FMRP, causing the classical FXS phenotype. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Full mutation in boys'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Full mutation in girls'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expansion between approximately 50 to 55 and 200 repeats is known as premutation. The <em>FMR1</em> gene remains transcriptionally active, FMRP is produced, and the classic FXS phenotype does not occur. However, a spectrum of clinical findings is associated with the premutation. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Premutation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>DNA methylation turns off gene activity, thus preventing gene transcription. Elongation of the CGG repeats allows hypermethylation of <em>FMR1</em>, resulting in impaired transcription and reduced production of the FMRP. Lower levels of FMRP appear to have a major impact upon the severity of the FXS phenotype. Individuals with nearly normal levels of FMRP may have mild or no symptoms, while those with very little or no normal FMRP may have more severe symptoms.</p><p>The genetics and molecular biology of FXS are discussed in detail separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fragile-x-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Magnetic resonance imaging and quantitative morphometry demonstrate that individuals with a fragile X mental retardation 1 (<em>FMR1</em>) gene full mutation have increased total brain volume, with relatively increased caudate nucleus, fourth ventricle, and hippocampal volumes and decreased cerebellar vermis volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fragile-x-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

In addition, cognitive level and adaptive behavior skills decline after early childhood, reflecting the slow acquisition of skills compared with other children of the same age rather than a regression of skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fragile-x-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16,31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,31-35</a>].

Cluttering is often present. Cluttering is a rapid, fluctuating rate of speech with repetitions of sounds, words, and phrases and occasional garbled, slurred, or disorganized speech.</p><p>Prepubertal boys and, in particular, preschool boys with FXS generally have higher IQs than adolescents and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fragile-x-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FXS is an X-linked disorder.
