The exact etiology of cramps in dialysis patients is unknown. Since cramps tend to occur most frequently near the end of hemodialysis treatments, changes in plasma osmolality <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extracellular fluid volume have been implicated.</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical features, and treatment of cramps occurring in association with dialysis will be reviewed here. A general overview of muscle cramps and other acute complications of dialysis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nocturnal-leg-cramps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nocturnal leg cramps&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complications-during-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complications during hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cramp is a prolonged involuntary muscle contraction that occurs in a muscle that voluntarily contracts when it is already in its most shortened position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The increased frequency of cramps at rest and during the night may be caused by the placement (by the plantar-flexed foot) of the calf and ventral foot muscles in the most shortened and vulnerable position during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Electromyography reveals that cramps begin with fasciculations in various muscle parts that subsequently progress to high-frequency action potentials. The origin of a cramp is therefore neural, not muscular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The etiology of hemodialysis-associated cramps may include contributions from one or more of the following factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma volume contraction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyponatremia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue hypoxia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypomagnesemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carnitine deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated serum leptin levels</p><p/><p>Of these, volume contraction and hyponatremia, either alone or in combination, are the most likely underlying causative factors; this hypothesis is supported in part by the reduction in the frequency of cramping in association with sodium modeling or ramping, a technique whereby gradual decrements in dialysate sodium concentration occur over the course of a hemodialysis treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Leptin, a middle molecule, is able to affect neuronal activity and, therefore, may be implicated in the development of cramps. Hemodialysis-related cramps may be associated with older age and increasing tertiles of serum leptin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Additional study of this phenomenon is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cramps occurring with dialysis treatment most commonly involve the muscles of the lower extremity, but the muscles of the hands, arms, and abdomen may also be affected. Cramps occur more often in older, nondiabetic, anxious patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Low parathyroid hormone (PTH) values and high serum creatine phosphokinase concentrations are also more frequent among patients with dialysis-associated cramps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Multiple factors related to the dialysis procedure enhance the risk of cramps. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solute concentrations of the dialysate bath, particularly low concentrations of sodium (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-metabolic-and-hemodynamic-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury: Metabolic and hemodynamic considerations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased ultrafiltration required to remove excessive fluid ingested in the interdialytic period</p><p/><p>One study suggests that cramps may be less common with hemodiafiltration compared with high-flux hemodialysis in older adults, but more study of this is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is directed at two goals: reducing the frequency of cramps and relieving symptoms when they occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Interventions to reduce the frequency of cramps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The minimization of interdialytic weight gains, the prevention of dialysis-associated hypotension, the use of high concentrations of sodium in the dialysate, carnitine supplementation, and the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> may all reduce the frequency of dialysis-associated cramps.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Minimize interdialytic weight gains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimizing interdialytic weight gains will avoid plasma volume contraction and hypo-osmolality that occurs with high rates of ultrafiltration required to achieve the patient's dry weight during a brief dialysis session; such measures may prevent or at least reduce the frequency of dialysis-associated cramps.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention of dialysis-associated hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since dialysis-associated hypotension may precede or accompany dialysis-associated cramps, measures which prevent volume depletion and hypotension may also be effective in reducing cramps. Such interventions include sequential <span class=\"nowrap\">ultrafiltration/dialysis</span> and sodium ramping or modeling (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;</a>). Infusions of hypertonic saline, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, or dextrose may also prevent hypotension during a dialysis session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of cramps during hemodialysis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Higher dialysate sodium concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Higher dialysate sodium concentration and oral salt loading reduce the incidence of hemodialysis-associated cramps. However, the increased thirst and interdialytic fluid gains associated with higher dialysate sodium subsequently led to the development of sodium modeling or ramping.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Carnitine supplementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A deficiency of carnitine may enhance the risk of cramps, a problem that can be corrected by dietary supplementation. Carnitine may be administered intravenously (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> after hemodialysis or orally (330 mg two to three times per day). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carnitine metabolism in renal disease and dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Quinine sulfate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite limited and varying results in clinical trials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> sulfate has been prescribed for cramps for over four decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. One double-blind placebo-controlled trial of nine hemodialysis patients found that the administration of quinine sulfate at the start of the hemodialysis session reduced the frequency of cramps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These beneficial results may be caused by decreased excitability of the motor endplate to nerve stimulation and increased muscle refractory period, thereby preventing prolonged involuntary muscle contraction.</p><p>However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning stating that the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> for the unapproved <span class=\"nowrap\">prevention/treatment</span> of leg cramps is not justified, given that this agent is associated with severe adverse events. These include cardiac arrhythmias, severe allergic reactions, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS). Quinine should therefore <strong>not</strong> be administered in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy#H590279569\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy&quot;, section on 'Quinine'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitamin E</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin E</a> before bedtime may be effective for the prevention of hemodialysis-associated cramps. In a randomized, controlled, double-blind study of 29 chronic dialysis patients, vitamin E (400 int. unit) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> sulfate (325 mg) were equally effective and significantly more beneficial than placebo in reducing the number and severity of nocturnal cramps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>A second placebo-controlled, double-blind study found that the short-term administration of the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> and C reduced cramping, with vitamin E and C alone both being relatively less effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Another study of 19 patients reported a 68 percent reduction in cramps when hemodialysis patients were given vitamin E 400 int. unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It is unclear whether such therapy is safe and effective when administered chronically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of additional medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> agents have been used to prevent leg cramps. They are of variable efficacy and have rarely been tested in controlled trials in either dialysis or non-end-stage renal disease (ESRD) populations. These include short-acting benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxazepam</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, creatine monohydrate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1,4,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,13,14</a>].</p><p>A preliminary study of five patients demonstrated the effectiveness of a traditional herbal medicine called shao-yao-gan-cao-tang (Japanese name: Shakuyaku-kanzo-to), which is equal parts paeony and licorice roots, in reducing cramps in hemodialysis patients and, in vitro, inhibiting skeletal muscle contraction in rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Controlled trials in larger numbers of patients are needed to better assess its efficacy and safety.</p><p>A small randomized, controlled trial of 20 minutes of leg massage during hemodialysis treatments (three times per week for a two-week period in 26 patients) found a significant reduction in postdialysis leg cramping (a decrease of 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">episodes/week</span> in those receiving massage versus a reduction of 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">episodes/week</span> in controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the number of episodes of cramping during dialysis were not affected by the massage. A larger study of this intervention may be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A reasonable clinical approach to the patient with frequent dialysis-associated cramps is to minimize excessive interdialytic fluid gains while re-evaluating the patient's appropriate desired weight. An increase in the frequency of hemodialysis may be helpful. Sodium modeling on dialysis should be tried with or without prophylactic measures, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>, while paying close attention to assessment of &quot;dry weight&quot; as interdialytic weight gains may occur with sodium modeling. Switching dialysis modalities to peritoneal dialysis or a home hemodialysis modality like short daily or long nocturnal dialysis or possibly hemodiafiltration where available may also be considered.</p><p>As with the nondialysis population, measures to prevent nocturnal leg cramps may be effective and, therefore, encouraged in dialysis patients complaining of frequent nocturnal leg cramps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Measures may include riding a stationary bicycle for a few minutes before retiring or performing stretching exercises (such as holding for 10 to 20 seconds and repeating three to five times in succession four times daily for one week, then twice daily in the evening and again before retiring).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of cramps during hemodialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the possible preventive measures, cramping while on dialysis remains a common problem, particularly in the subset of patients with large interdialytic fluid gains. The reversal of low blood pressure should be the first priority in the management of the patient with muscle cramps in association with hypotension. If necessary, ultrafiltration should either be stopped or the rate decreased, the patient should be placed in the Trendelenburg position, and the blood flow rate should be reduced. The clinician must also be aware that hypotension may be a manifestation of a potentially serious medical condition requiring immediate attention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Further measures to treat dialysis-associated cramps are generally aimed at increasing plasma osmolality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertonic saline versus dextrose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 20 patients with 100 episodes of muscle cramps, hypertonic saline and 50 percent dextrose were equally effective for the relief of cramps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The investigators suggested that hypertonic saline may be preferred among those with volume depletion. In most cases, however, hypertonic dextrose may be the better therapeutic option (in nondiabetic patients) because it does not adversely affect salt and water balance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Mannitol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mannitol</a> infusion, given at a dose of 12.5 to 37.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dialysis,</span> is also effective in the management of dialysis-associated cramps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, mannitol may accumulate in the extracellular space, particularly when administered near the end of a hemodialysis session.</p><p>Thus, hypertonic saline or dextrose is preferred for the treatment of dialysis-associated cramps occurring near the end of dialysis treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, local massage of the affected muscle and the application of moist heat may provide some comfort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
