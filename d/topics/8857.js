Both can be a constituent of the normal microbiota but can also cause both superficial and invasive infections in humans. Invasive disease due to <em>Trichosporon</em> spp, called trichosporonosis, occurs almost exclusively in immunocompromised hosts, appears to be increasing in frequency, and is usually fatal. This fungus also causes a characteristic infection of hair shafts called white piedra.</p><p>The mycology, epidemiology, and clinical infections caused by both <em>Trichosporon</em> spp and the related fungus <em>Blastoschizomyces capitatus</em> will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1470017038\"><span class=\"h1\">NOMENCLATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>B. capitatus</em> has also been called <em>Geotrichum capitatum </em>and<em> Saprochaete capitata</em> and the teleomorph has been called <em>Dipodascus capitatus and Magnusiomyces capitatus</em>, but in this topic we will stay with the nomenclature of <em>Blastoschizomyces.</em></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MYCOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mycology of <em>Trichosporon</em> spp is extremely complicated because the designation refers to a heterogeneous group of organisms. The heterogeneity results from the absence of simple methods to distinguish among the species in the clinical microbiology laboratory; thus, multiple members of the genus <em>Trichosporon</em> were previously categorized together under the name <em>T. beigelii</em>. With the use of modern molecular techniques, some mycologists have proposed a rearrangement of the genus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The proposed names for the six main species associated with human infection are <em>T. asahii</em>, <em>T. asteroides</em>, <em>T. cutaneum</em>, <em>T. inkin</em>, <em>T. mucoides</em>, and <em>T. ovoides</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The following disease associations have been observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>T. asahii</em> and <em>T. mucoides</em> are associated with systemic infection; <em>T. asahii</em> is more common than <em>T. mucoides</em>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>T. inkin</em> and <em>T. ovoides</em> are associated with white piedra, affecting hair shafts; <em>T. ovoides</em> with infection of the hair of the scalp; and <em>T. inkin </em>with infection of the pubic hair.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>T. asteroides</em> and <em>T. cutaneum</em> are associated with superficial skin lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>T. ovoides</em> has been implicated in a few cases of systemic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A novel member of the genus, <em>T. mycotoxinivorans</em>, has been described as a pulmonary pathogen with an apparent predilection for patients with cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Members of the genus <em>Trichosporon</em> are characterized by the formation of arthroconidia, blastoconidia, hyphae, and pseudohyphae. The genus <em>Trichosporon</em> is closely related to <em>Cryptococcus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. These two fungi share some antigens, and cross-reactivity with the cryptococcal polysaccharide latex agglutination assay can be seen in patients with trichosporonosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Trichosporon do not ferment carbohydrates but can assimilate various complex sugars. There is no sexual state known for the genus.</p><p>Isolation of this fungus from clinical specimens is relatively easy since it grows rapidly on almost all standard fungal media. Colonies usually appear as ivory to beige and moist with radiating furrows over time. Microscopic examination of all isolates shows nonbranching, septate, hyaline hyphae that disarticulate to form arthroconidia. Pseudohyphae and blastoconidia can also be seen.</p><p>In clinical specimens, a yeast-like organism that is urease positive and forms arthroconidia can be presumptively identified as <em>Trichosporon</em> spp. The identification can then be confirmed with tests of carbohydrate assimilation using commercially available kits. Distinguishing among the proposed species is not currently performed in most clinical laboratories, but guidelines for doing so have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p><em>B. capitatus</em> can easily be mistaken for <em>Trichosporon</em> spp because the microscopic appearance is similar. Similar to the <em>Trichosporon</em> species, <em>B. capitatus</em> grows quickly on most mycologic media. Colonies are white, can be smooth or wrinkled, and aerial mycelia can be visible after several days of growth. Microscopically, there are septate, branching hyphae that disarticulate to form arthroconidia. If specialized conidial structures called annelloconidia are seen, this suggests <em>Blastoschizomyces capitatus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and distinguishes <em>B. capitatus</em> from <em>Trichosporon </em>spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Another important distinguishing factor is the urease test; all <em>Trichosporon</em> species are urease positive, and <em>B. capitatus</em> is always urease negative. <em>B. capitatus</em> is classified as an ascomycete based upon the production of asci by the teleomorph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both <em>Trichosporon</em> spp and <em>B. capitatus</em> are found in nature, predominantly in soil. There does not appear to be any association with animals although these fungi have been cultured from animal droppings.</p><p>Humans can be colonized with <em>Trichosporon</em> spp and <em>B. capitatus</em>. Mucosal surfaces, stool, sputum, and hair have all been reported as sites of colonization. Rates of colonization vary from 1 to 3 percent in patients admitted to general hospital wards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, higher rates have been reported in other patient populations. A study of inguinal skin scrapings from asymptomatic outpatient volunteers in Houston showed <em>Trichosporon</em> colonization rates of 12.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Another study, done in a Danish sexually transmitted diseases clinic, found rectal colonization rates with <em>Trichosporon</em> spp of 13 percent in male homosexuals and 2.5 percent in male heterosexuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Superficial infections due to <em>Trichosporon</em> spp occur primarily in immunocompetent patients in tropical climates. Some temperate areas, especially the southeastern United States, also have a relatively high prevalence of these superficial infections. White piedra, especially involving the genital area, appears to be most commonly found in young men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. These superficial infections appear to be sporadic and probably result from asymptomatic carriage of the organism in the hair and skin. Person-to-person spread of superficial <em>Trichosporon </em>spp infections does not occur; poor personal hygiene <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low socioeconomic status are not known risk factors.</p><p><em>Trichosporon </em>spp have been implicated as a cause of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It appears that individuals, perhaps with an underlying genetic predisposition, can react to <em>Trichosporon </em>antigens with a resulting pneumonitis. When rigorous efforts were made to eliminate the organism from the homes of affected patients, the incidence of the disease decreased. It is unclear whether this entity exists outside of Japan.</p><p>Invasive trichosporonosis occurs almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients. The majority of cases have been seen in patients with hematologic malignancies, often in the setting of neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/5,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18-20</a>].

The culture of one of these fungi from a sterile body site must always be regarded as serious. Mucosal cultures growing either <em>Trichosporon</em> spp or <em>B. capitatus</em>, by contrast, can represent colonization and need to be interpreted in the clinical context. It is unclear if surveillance cultures positive for these fungi in immunocompromised patients assist in predicting subsequent infection. There have been pseudo-outbreaks due to <em>Trichosporon</em> spp as a result of improperly sterilized endoscopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. There have also been hospital outbreaks of trichosporonosis in immunocompromised hosts, and therefore careful adherence to infection control practices will be paramount to protect patients at risk for invasive disease caused by <em>Trichosporon</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p><em>B. capitatus</em> has only been described as a systemic pathogen, and the affected patients have had some underlying immunocompromising condition, usually neutropenia. The number of reported cases is quite small, most occurring in Italy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Cardiac valve replacement in immunocompromised patients has also led to disseminated infection with this fungus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In white piedra, <em>Trichosporon</em> spp begins to grow just beneath the cuticle of hairs shafts. Growth continues outside the hair shaft and a nodule is formed. These nodules can easily be pulled off the hair but, when left in place, the hair shaft becomes weakened and breaks at the site of the nodule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There are suggestions that strains of <em>Corynebacterium</em> can enhance the growth of <em>Trichosporon</em> spp and may play a synergistic role in white piedra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Most invasive <em>Trichosporon</em> spp infections probably start with colonization of mucosal or cutaneous surfaces, with a break in the integrity of the surface subsequently seeding the bloodstream. Such breaks may be secondary to chemotherapy-induced epithelial damage or intravascular catheters. Antibiotics probably increase the incidence and extent of colonization and may play a role in increasing the risk of human infections.</p><p>In some cases of localized infection, the fungus may have seeded the site of infection directly. In patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by <em>Trichosporon </em>spp, for example, there may have been direct infection of the prosthesis during the operative procedure rather than fungemia seeding the valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other examples that may have resulted from direct inoculation of the fungus include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritonitis in chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningitis following a myelogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endophthalmitis after cataract surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]</p><p/><p>In vitro studies have shown that <em>Trichosporon</em> isolates are much more resistant to phagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes than are isolates of <em>Candida albicans</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Pretreatment with colony-stimulating factors and interferon-gamma did not enhance fungal killing by neutrophils but did increase killing by monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>In experimental murine infections, intravenous injection of <em>Trichosporon</em> spp arthroconidia results in multiple focal abscesses throughout the body but especially in the kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Histologic inspection of lesions from both experimental and human infections shows that the formation of hyphae may assist in the invasion of tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Emboli consisting of hyphae are frequently found occluding small blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Many of the lesions in trichosporonosis are probably due to infarcts resulting from angioinvasive foci of <em>Trichosporon</em> spp.</p><p>Little is known about possible virulence traits in <em>Trichosporon</em> spp. Virulence factors such as toxins, special adherence properties, or components that allow the organism to evade the host's immune system have not yet been found. A cell wall antigen with similarities to the glucuronoxylomannan of <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em> has been postulated to be a potential virulence factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As already mentioned, <em>Trichosporon</em> spp can cause both superficial and invasive infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Superficial infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with white piedra are usually asymptomatic and only seek medical attention because of the grossly visible nodules on the affected hair. Pruritus or pain at the involved site is an occasional complaint. The nodules are usually soft, pasty, and ivory colored. They are about 0.5 mm in size but can coalesce to blanket several millimeters of the hair shaft. Genital and facial hair are more often involved than the scalp and torso.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive infections due to <em>T. asahii</em> can be divided into disseminated and localized forms. The disseminated form is more common and, as mentioned above, usually occurs in neutropenic patients. The patient typically has an acute febrile illness that progresses rapidly to multiorgan failure.</p><p>Patients with pulmonary involvement can have dyspnea and a cough productive of scant, bloody sputum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Chest radiographs usually show diffuse infiltrates with an alveolar pattern. Lobar infiltrates, reticulonodular infiltrates, and cavitation have also been observed. Patients with renal involvement usually have microscopic hematuria and proteinuria and progress to renal failure. Involvement of the kidneys has been nearly a universal finding in autopsies of patients with disseminated trichosporonosis.</p><p>Skin lesions are seen in about one-third of patients with disseminated trichosporonosis. The cutaneous manifestations include erythematous papules on the trunk and extremities that can sometimes form bullae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/42,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,45,46</a>]. Over time, the papules can develop central necrosis and appear as eschars.</p><p>Some patients who have recovered from their neutropenia and responded to antifungal drugs have presented with a chronic disseminated form of trichosporonosis that is similar to chronic hepatosplenic candidiasis. The few patients reported with this syndrome have had multiple lesions in the liver and spleen associated with fever and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-disseminated-candidiasis-hepatosplenic-candidiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic disseminated candidiasis (hepatosplenic candidiasis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Invasive <em>Trichosporon</em> spp infections less commonly can be confined to a single organ. The heart valves, central nervous system (CNS), peritoneum, and surgical wounds have all been described as involved sites in the absence of known infection elsewhere. Most of the cases of endocarditis due to <em>Trichosporon</em> spp have involved prosthetic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/27,28,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,47</a>]. However, there have been cases of native valve endocarditis in injection drug users. Valvular vegetations in <em>Trichosporon </em>endocarditis tend to be large and bulky as with other forms of fungal endocarditis. These vegetations have a predilection to embolize and cause sudden ischemic events, especially in the lower limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/27,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,47</a>].</p><p>In cases of CNS infection due to <em>Trichosporon</em> spp, the predominant symptoms are headache, nausea, vomiting, and fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/37,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,48</a>]. Peritonitis with <em>Trichosporon</em> spp, as a complication of chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. There are also increasing reports of bone involvement during dissemination of these fungi and, in particular, spine involvement such as spondylodiscitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Disseminated infections due to <em>B. capitatus</em> present in a fashion similar to those due to <em>Trichosporon</em> spp. Affected patients present with the sudden onset of fever and rapidly develop pulmonary abnormalities, hypotension, and renal failure. Some have had skin lesions with necrotic papules, and some have had CNS involvement with abscesses and meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455289667\"><span class=\"h2\">Superficial infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of white piedra is suggested by the characteristic nodules on the shafts of affected hairs.

Blood cultures are frequently positive in disseminated infection. Culture and histopathology of skin lesions have also been helpful in establishing the diagnosis in disseminated infections. Skin biopsies show dermal invasion by hyphae and arthroconidia, and some have shown thromboembolic vasculitis due to the fungi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage cultures can yield <em>Trichosporon</em> spp in patients with pneumonitis, and urine cultures have been positive in some cases of disseminated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-trichosporon-species-and-blastoschizomyces-capitatus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Again, it must be emphasized that cultures of <em>Trichosporon</em> spp isolated from sputum or urine may represent colonization rather than infection.
