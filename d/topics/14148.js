In the United States the Department of Health and Human Services has published guidelines on the evaluation and management of HIV-infected pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Our recommendations below are largely consistent with these guidelines.</p><p>The use of antiretroviral (ARV) medications during pregnancy, intrapartum care, and infant antiretroviral prophylaxis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiretroviral and intrapartum management of pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7447182\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough history and physical examination should be performed in the HIV-infected pregnant woman to see if there are health concerns in the mother, which may also affect the well-being of the fetus. Patients should be interviewed about any history of opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), medication use (including over the counter drugs), immunization status, or substance abuse issues. Immunosuppressed women who report fevers and weight loss may have an underlying opportunistic infection, which may compromise maternal and fetal health (eg, tuberculosis).</p><p>The physical examination should be focused on assessing any signs of advanced HIV infection (eg, thrush or evidence of wasting) or signs of concomitant STDs (eg, genital ulcers or vaginal discharge). Since many HIV-infected patients are also at risk for viral hepatitis, a careful examination for stigmata of advanced liver disease (eg, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, spider angiomata) is also indicated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10063269\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal care providers should address potentially modifiable behaviors, which have been associated with an increased risk of HIV perinatal transmission, such as cigarette smoking, illicit drug use (eg, cocaine, heroin), and unprotected intercourse with multiple partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. Some of these risk factors are also associated with low birth weight. However, most of these studies were conducted prior to the era of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) so the true magnitude of effect is unclear. </p><p>Women should be counseled regarding the harmful effects of alcohol or cocaine use on fetal development. Patients should also be counseled to discontinue cigarette smoking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=substance-misuse-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Substance misuse in pregnant women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette and tobacco products in pregnancy: Impact on pregnancy and the neonate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be advised to use condoms with sexual activity, since STDs can lead to preterm delivery and teratogenicity (eg, congenital syphilis). Providers should evaluate for evidence of sexually transmitted infections as part of routine antenatal care.

Accurate determination of fetal gestational age is particularly important among pregnant women with HIV infection, since early delivery may be necessary to decrease the risk of perinatal HIV transmission. Delivery by pre-labor cesarean section is recommended at 38 weeks gestation in the event of incomplete viral suppression (&gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span>. Because of the potential need for an early, scheduled cesarean delivery with the attendant risk of fetal pulmonary immaturity, a first trimester ultrasound should be performed, when possible, to ensure accurate pregnancy dating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that ultrasound estimation during the first half of pregnancy is superior to estimating the delivery date based on the last menstrual period or physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].

For patients who have been on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) with consistent viral suppression, and CD4 counts above the threshold for opportunistic infections, CD4 cell count monitoring may be done every six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>].</p><p>Pregnancy itself is associated with a decline in absolute CD4 count number, which may be related to increased plasma blood volume; however, there is usually no effect on the CD4 cell percentage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Therefore, some clinicians prefer to monitor the CD4 cell percentage during pregnancy; however, decisions regarding opportunistic infection prophylaxis and monitoring of ART response are based on absolute CD4 cell count numbers. The CD4 cell criteria for initiation of prophylaxis for pneumocystis, toxoplasmosis, or Mycobacterium avium complex are the same as in nonpregnant HIV-infected patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-prevention-of-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of prevention of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H8632859\" class=\"local\">'Chemoprophylaxis for opportunistic infections'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10063326\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral load measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma HIV RNA is monitored frequently during pregnancy to confirm attainment and maintenance of viral suppression. As in nonpregnant adults, patients should exhibit at least one log decline in plasma viremia by a month after initiation of therapy. Complete viral suppression should be achieved within 16 to 24 weeks after initiation of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Close monitoring is desired to confirm the effectiveness of the patient&rsquo;s antiretroviral (ARV) drug regimen since higher levels of HIV RNA are associated with increased risk of perinatal transmission of HIV infection. HIV RNA levels are generally monitored at entry into care, at the time of ARV initiation, two to four weeks after initiation (or changing) of therapy, monthly until complete viral suppression and then at least every three months for the remainder of the pregnancy. </p><p>In addition, plasma viral load should be assessed at 34 to 36 weeks gestation in order to aid in the decision regarding mode and timing of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If the viral load is detectable, resistance testing and assessment of adherence is advised. If the viral load is &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> near term gestation, the patient should be counseled regarding the benefits of scheduled pre-labor cesarean section at 38 weeks gestation for the prevention of perinatal transmission. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings#H2152172955\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiretroviral and intrapartum management of pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Mode of delivery'</a>.)</p><p>The relationship between HIV RNA levels and risk of perinatal transmission is discussed in detail elsewhere.

For treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected pregnant women, ART should be initiated prior to receiving the results of the resistance testing; the regimen can be modified if necessary based on the results of the resistance assay. This is particularly important if the mother presents late for care, as the risk of perinatal transmission is associated with the duration of antenatal ART and level of viral suppression at delivery.

As with all HIV-infected patients, complete blood count (CBC), BUN and creatinine, and liver function tests are checked prior to ART initiation and three to six months thereafter. Urinalysis is also checked after ART initiation and every six months while on a tenofovir-containing regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult#H1356106898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary care of the HIV-infected adult&quot;, section on 'Hematologic, renal, and hepatic toxicity'</a>.)</p><p>Even in the absence of potential ART toxicity, HIV infection has also been associated with abnormalities of bone marrow, kidney, and liver function, either directly or because of comorbid conditions. Maternal anemia has been associated with an increased risk of both adverse pregnancy outcomes as well as mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Testing for hepatitis B infection includes hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to core and surface antigens (ie, anti-HB core and anti-HBs). Testing for hepatitis C infection includes serologic testing; patients with advanced HIV infection (CD4 cell count &lt;100 cells) and risk factors for HCV (eg, injection drug use history) should also have HCV RNA testing since antibody testing can be falsely negative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-c-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, natural history, and diagnosis of hepatitis C in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of hepatitis B in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HIV-infected women without evidence of Hepatitis B infection (ie, nonreactive anti-HB core and anti-HBs results) should begin an HBV immunization series, since the recombinant vaccine is safe to give during pregnancy. HIV-infected women with evidence of chronic hepatitis B infection will need consultation with a specialist knowledgeable in both liver and HIV disease. Certain antiretroviral (ARV) medications have dual activity against HIV and hepatitis B viruses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiretroviral and intrapartum management of pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HIV-infected women without evidence of HCV infection should be counseled regarding avoidance of HCV acquisition (eg, abstinence from injection drug use; avoidance of unprotected intercourse with an HCV-seropositive partner). Acute infection with HCV during pregnancy is problematic because direct-acting antiviral agents have not been studied in pregnancy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> is contraindicated in pregnancy, and interferon is not recommended. Also, theoretically, there is an increased risk of HCV transmission to the infant due to the high levels of viremia that are observed during early infection. </p><p>Vertical transmission of HCV appears to be facilitated by HIV-coinfection, compared with HIV-seronegative patients. A meta-analysis of 10 studies demonstrated that maternal coinfection increases the odds of vertical HCV transmission by approximately 90 percent (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI 1.4-2.7) compared with maternal HCV infection alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There are currently no differences in general management principles (eg, the timing or mode of delivery) based on HCV coinfection in the mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Thus, among HIV-uninfected women, evidence of acute infection is generally determined based on discovery of abnormal ultrasound findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Congenital toxoplasmosis causes intracranial calcifications and neurologic disability in the neonate.

Alternatives for those with allergies or intolerance to TMP-SMX include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> (for PCP) and dapsone with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrimethamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrimethamine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (for toxoplasmosis). </p><p>Limited and indirect data support the overall safety of TMP-SMX during pregnancy. In a systematic review of 16 studies that evaluated the rate of congenital deformities in infants whose mothers used TMP-SMX during pregnancy for various reasons, the pooled rate was 3.5 percent, which is comparable to historically reported rates of congenital defects in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The pooled rate of defects was 4.8 percent among those studies that evaluated TMP-SMX exposure during the first trimester and 1.4 percent among those that evaluated exposure during the second and third trimesters only. However, in many of the included studies, TMP-SMX exposure was limited to short-term use, which may not accurately reflect the risk with daily, long-term use for chemoprophylaxis.</p><p>Indications for chemoprophylaxis of PCP and reactivation toxoplasmosis in pregnant women are the same as in non-pregnant HIV-infected adults and are discussed in detail elsewhere.

In a Danish registry-based observational study, oral fluconazole use in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion compared with no or only topical azole exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Until more data on the association are available, oral fluconazole should only be used with caution in pregnancy. Instead, for treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis during pregnancy, we recommend using topical treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nystatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nystatin</a> suspension, and for treatment of vaginal candidiasis during pregnancy, we recommend topical treatment with an azole for seven days.

Patients should be on an effective ART regimen with an undetectable plasma viral load before any invasive procedure. If amniocentesis or other invasive procedure is necessary and plasma viral load is not below detectable, consultation with an expert is recommended.
