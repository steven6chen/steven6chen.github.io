(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiologic associations of hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of HCC can be difficult and often requires the use of one or more imaging modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Ideally, tumors should be detected when they are approximately 2 cm in size so that all treatment options can be offered. However, HCC is frequently diagnosed late in its course because of the absence of pathognomonic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. As a result, many patients have untreatable disease when first diagnosed. The median survival following diagnosis is approximately 6 to 20 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Large tumor size, vascular invasion, poor functional status, and nodal metastases are all associated with a poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical and histologic features of HCC, and the various modalities used to diagnose and stage this aggressive tumor. The controversial topic of screening populations at risk for HCC will also be discussed. An overview of treatment for this tumor is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually have no symptoms other than those related to their chronic liver disease. Suspicion for HCC should be heightened in patients with previously compensated cirrhosis who develop decompensation such as ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice, or variceal bleeding. These complications are often associated with extension of the tumor into the hepatic or portal veins or arteriovenous shunting induced by the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Some patients may have mild to moderate upper abdominal pain, weight loss, early satiety, or a palpable mass in the upper abdomen. These symptoms often indicate an advanced lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other uncommon presentations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive jaundice caused by invasion of the biliary tree, compression of the intrahepatic duct, or rarely, as a result of hemobilia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone pain or dyspnea due to metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraperitoneal bleeding due to tumor rupture. Tumor rupture is often associated with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain with distension, an acute drop in the hematocrit and hypotension, and is most commonly diagnosed by peritoneal lavage and laparotomy. A computed tomography (CT) scan typically demonstrates a liver mass and free intraperitoneal blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This is a life-threatening complication, and control of bleeding may require emergent angiography and embolization of the bleeding vessel, or even surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although the risk of peritoneal dissemination is high, delayed resection may be considered, if feasible.

Hepatomegaly or a bruit heard over the liver are occasionally present.</p><p>Laboratory examination is usually nonspecific. The majority of patients who develop HCC have cirrhosis, and may have thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoprothrombinemia. Patients are often mildly anemic and may have electrolyte disturbances (eg, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis) associated with defective water handling or with diuretic use. Serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase are often abnormal in a nonspecific pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Paraneoplastic syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with HCC occasionally develop a paraneoplastic syndrome that can manifest as hypoglycemia, erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia, or severe watery diarrhea. The presence of any of these manifestations, other than erythrocytosis, is generally associated with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypoglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoglycemia, which usually occurs in advanced HCC, is thought to result from the tumor's high metabolic needs. The hypoglycemia is typically mild and produces no symptoms; however, more severe reductions in the plasma glucose can occur, resulting in lethargy and confusion.</p><p>Less than 5 percent of tumors secrete insulin-like growth factor-II, which can cause severe symptomatic hypoglycemia, sometimes early in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Erythrocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erythrocytosis in HCC is probably due to tumor secretion of erythropoietin (EPO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Although raised serum EPO levels may be present in up to 23 percent of patients with HCC, elevations in hemoglobin concentration or packed cell volume are uncommon, and most patients are anemic at diagnosis because of other effects of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In one study, for example, diarrhea was significantly more common among cirrhotic patients with HCC compared to matched cirrhotic controls (48 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Rarely, diarrhea may be severe and intractable, leading to hypokalemia and achlorhydria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The mechanism underlying this syndrome is not fully understood but it may be related to secretion of peptides that cause intestinal secretion. These include vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, gastrin, and peptides with prostaglandin-like immunoreactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cutaneous features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several cutaneous manifestations have been described in association with HCC; however, none is specific for the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Extrahepatic metastases are more common in patients with advanced stage primary tumors (&gt;5 cm, large vessel vascular invasion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Extrahepatic disease spread is also uncommon as a component of disease recurrence after locoregional therapy (5 to 24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. The most common sites are lung, intra-abdominal lymph nodes, bone, and adrenal gland, in that order. Brain metastases are rare overall (0.2 to 2 percent), although a higher rate has been reported in patients with advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

In patients with cirrhosis, benign nodal enlargement is frequent and most often involves the porta hepatis and portacaval space.

Similar guidelines have been issued by the European Association for the Study of the Liver, though they differ in the evaluation of patients with nodules between 1 and 2 cm in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'AASLD guidelines'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13798191\" class=\"local\">'EASL guidelines'</a> below.) </p><p>The diagnostic approach to a solid liver lesion in such patients is determined by the size of the lesion. We typically will image lesions less than 1 cm with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for imaging features of HCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78245\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78245 \">algorithm 1</a>). If negative, we then obtain follow-up ultrasounds every three months. This approach differs from guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], which recommend serial ultrasounds every three months. Larger lesions require further evaluation with computed tomography (CT) or MRI. Histologic confirmation is not required in a patient at increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma whose lesion(s) fulfill criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma. However, if the diagnosis remains unclear and the results will affect the patient's management, a biopsy of the lesions is indicated. </p><p>The only way to effectively diagnose HCC in a timely fashion is to enter patients who are at high risk for development of this tumor in a regular surveillance program using ultrasound imaging every six months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma and recommendations for surveillance in adults with chronic liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients who are not in a routine surveillance program, the diagnosis of HCC may be first entertained in a patient with underlying liver disease (eg, cirrhosis, chronic viral hepatitis) who develops a rising serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In such patients, a contrast CT scan of the liver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI study is often the initial diagnostic test. In patients with cirrhosis, any dominant solid nodule that is not clearly a hemangioma should be considered HCC unless proven otherwise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F67676\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67676 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. If the lesion is hypervascular on the arterial phase and radiolucent on the venous of the CT scan (referred to by radiologists as &quot;arterial enhancement with washout&quot;), has increased T2 signal intensity on MRI, demonstrates invasion of the portal vein, or is associated with a marked elevation of AFP (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> or greater), the diagnosis is almost certain.</p><p>If the initial diagnostic imaging study is not definitive, an alternative imaging technique or follow-up imaging may clarify the diagnosis; dysplastic nodules typically remain stable, while an enlarging dominant lesion more likely represents HCC. Even stable nodules require close follow-up, since livers containing dysplastic nodules are at high risk to develop HCC in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Molecular genetic studies have shown promise in identifying a molecular signature that can differentiate dysplastic nodules from HCC, but more studies are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>For noncirrhotic patients, the diagnosis of HCC should be considered for any hepatic mass that is not clearly a hemangioma or focal nodular hyperplasia, especially if it is hypervascular. In the absence of specific clues to the diagnosis, biopsy may be appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous biopsy should only be performed when diagnostic imaging results are uncertain, for example, in patients with cirrhosis with hypovascular nodules, and the result would directly have an impact on management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solid liver lesions: Differential diagnosis and evaluation&quot;</a>). Guidelines for the role of a biopsy in establishing the diagnosis of HCC have been proposed in a statement issued by the AASLD (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'AASLD guidelines'</a> below). In addition, clinical criteria have been developed, which can be used for prioritizing patients with suspected HCC for liver transplantation without confirming the diagnosis with a biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

The reported magnitude of the risk ranges from 1.6 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-49</a>].

However, some reports have not observed an increased risk of needle tract seeding, or any adverse impact of preoperative fine-needle aspiration on long-term outcome in patients undergoing potentially curative resection of HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/42,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,51,52</a>]. Nevertheless, the potential risk of spreading tumor along the biopsy tract should always be considered in the decision to perform a biopsy, especially in patients in whom surgical resection or liver transplantation might be performed.

The guidelines point out that a mass found incidentally or on screening in the setting of a patient with known hepatitis B or cirrhosis of other etiology is likely to be HCC. The sequence of tests used to establish the diagnosis in such patients should be guided by the size of the lesion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodules found on ultrasound surveillance that are smaller than 1 cm should be followed with ultrasound at intervals of three to six months. If there has been no growth over a period of up to two years, one can revert to routine surveillance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions larger than 1 cm in diameter should be evaluated with dynamic MRI or helical multidetector CT scan using contrast. If the appearance is typical for HCC, no further investigation is required. If the characteristics are not typical for HCC (and do not suggest hemangioma), one of two strategies is acceptable: either a second study (CT or MRI, whichever was not performed) or a biopsy. If a second imaging study does not have imaging features of HCC, the lesion should be biopsied.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsies of small lesions should be evaluated by expert pathologists. Staining for tumor markers including CD34, CK7, glypican 3, Hsp70, and glutamine synthetase can help characterize lesions that are not clearly HCC on microscopy. If the biopsy is negative for HCC, patients should be followed by imaging at three to six month intervals until the nodule either disappears, enlarges, or displays diagnostic characteristics of HCC. If the lesion enlarges but remains atypical for HCC a repeat biopsy is recommended.

In some centers, CT scan is also used as a primary screening modality for HCC in patients with cirrhosis. New CT technology has substantially increased its accuracy compared with conventional scanning.</p><p>Several studies have evaluated test characteristics of CT for diagnosis of HCC. A meta-analysis estimated that the sensitivity for detecting patients with HCC was 83 percent (95% CI 46-90 percent) and specificity was 91 percent (95% CI 86-96 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p>The ability of CT to detect HCCs has improved with the development of helical CT technology. This technique involves the rapid administration of contrast material in combination with extremely fast imaging.

One study found that the degree of vascularity may not be a sufficiently sensitive criterion for accurate diagnosis of small (1 to 2 cm) tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].</p><p>Some tumors are isoattenuating on both arterial and portal phase imaging and may be missed.

Greater sensitivity can also be achieved using intra-arterial lipiodol, a contrast agent (sensitivity between 93 and 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]). However, this technique is not commonly used given the need for intra-arterial injection.</p><p>The sensitivity of CT scanning for the detection of small HCCs is dependent on the amount and timing of the contrast injection in relationship to the recording of images. Non-contrast CT scans have very low sensitivity for detecting small HCCs.

The role of MRI angiography is still being determined. MRI may be useful in patients with renal insufficiency or those with an allergy to CT contrast dye (agents). MRI may also be beneficial in cases in which CT results are ambiguous, particularly when the liver is extremely nodular since MRI can differentiate dysplastic nodules from HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">124,125</a>].

Suspicion for HCC should be heightened in patients with previously compensated cirrhosis who develop decompensation such as ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice, or variceal bleeding. Some patients may have mild to moderate upper abdominal pain, weight loss, early satiety, or a palpable mass in the upper abdomen, symptoms that often indicate an advanced lesion. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with HCC occasionally develop a paraneoplastic syndrome that can manifest as hypoglycemia, erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia, or severe watery diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Paraneoplastic syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical findings in most patients with HCC (splenomegaly, ascites, jaundice, or other manifestations of decompensated cirrhosis) reflect the underlying liver disease. Hepatomegaly or a bruit heard over the liver are occasionally present. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory examination is usually nonspecific. The majority of patients who develop HCC have cirrhosis and may have thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoprothrombinemia. Patients are often mildly anemic and may have electrolyte disturbances (eg, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis) associated with defective water handling or with diuretic use. Serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase are often abnormal in a nonspecific pattern. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The only way to effectively diagnose HCC in a timely fashion is to enter patients who are at high risk for development of this tumor in a regular surveillance program using ultrasound imaging every six months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma and recommendations for surveillance in adults with chronic liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are not in a routine surveillance program, the diagnosis of HCC may be first entertained in a patient with underlying liver disease who develops a rising serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78245\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78245 \">algorithm 1</a>). In such patients, a computed tomographic scan of the liver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance imaging study is often the initial diagnostic maneuver. In cirrhotic patients, any dominant solid nodule that is not clearly a hemangioma should be considered HCC unless proven otherwise. If the lesion is hypervascular, has increased T2 signal intensity, demonstrates venous invasion, or is associated with an elevated AFP, the diagnosis is almost certain. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the initial diagnostic imaging study is not definitive, an alternative imaging technique or follow-up imaging may clarify the diagnosis; dysplastic nodules typically remain stable, while an enlarging dominant lesion more likely represents HCC. Even stable nodules require close follow-up since livers containing dysplastic nodules are at high risk to develop HCC in the future.
