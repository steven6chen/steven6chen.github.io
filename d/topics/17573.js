The current mortality rate of meningococcal sepsis in the United States is approximately 10 to 14 percent. The supportive data are presented below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Because of the importance of early antibiotic therapy, meningococcal infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with the sudden onset of a febrile illness, especially those with petechiae <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> meningeal signs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of meningococcal sepsis is a complex medical problem, requiring a team approach by physicians skilled in intensive care medicine, infectious diseases, and the management of coagulopathies. Whenever possible, treatment should be given in a facility capable of administering the full range of medical care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2128584636\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2089800275\"><span class=\"h4\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key to successful outcome of life-threatening meningococcal infection is the prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics as early in the disease as possible. The presence of severe sepsis syndrome, fever, petechiae <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ecchymoses, or suspected bacterial meningitis demands prompt therapeutic intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Appropriate parenteral therapy can clear the cerebrospinal fluid of meningococci in less than six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Patients with meningococcal sepsis have extremely high bacterial loads, and increasing bacterial loads have been associated with a significant increase in the odds of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Given the rapid division time of meningococcus in vitro, a delay of 70 minutes would result in such an increase.</p><p>If meningococcal infection is suspected in a physician's office or outpatient clinic, the patient should be stabilized and transported promptly to an appropriate hospital facility. All attempts should be made to initiate parenteral antibiotics within one hour from outpatient presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The data on the efficacy of antibiotic administration prior to hospital transfer are variable; some studies performed during epidemics in the 1990s suggested that administration of antibiotics prior to transfer was associated with improved outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], while another study presented a contrary view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Blood cultures should be drawn prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy, and antibiotic therapy should <strong>not</strong> be delayed while waiting for lumbar puncture to be performed. Administration of antibiotic therapy prior to lumbar puncture can substantially diminish the probability of a positive cerebrospinal fluid culture, but often the diagnosis can be established from the pretreatment blood cultures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> molecular tools. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-meningococcal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of meningococcal infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During meningococcal epidemics, heightened awareness generally prompts treatment early in the course of infection. In the setting of endemic disease, however, the clinical presentation may be insidious, and diagnosis of meningococcal disease may be less clear. In general, if no antibiotics are administered initially, patients should be monitored carefully with instructions to return for follow-up evaluation in the setting of clinical deterioration (including fever, mental status changes, and rash).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h4\">Empiric therapy in nonepidemic settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cases of suspected bacterial meningitis, patients should be treated empirically to cover the most likely pathogens while awaiting culture results. Empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis is presented separately; the following discussion will be limited to the treatment of meningococcal infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial therapy and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Empiric therapy for patients with suspected (eg, Gram stain with gram-negative diplococci) or culture-proven meningococcal infection consists of a third-generation cephalosporin (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If the organism is proven to be penicillin susceptible, the treatment can then be switched to penicillin, although it is also reasonable to continue therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin given the excellent efficacy, convenient dosing, and affordability of these agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Empiric treatment during epidemics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemics of meningitis due to <em>N. meningitidis</em> are reported almost every year in sub-Saharan Africa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63287\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63287 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Since 1995, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended empiric treatment with one or two intramuscular injections of long-acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a> (oily suspension); however, the continuation of production of this drug is uncertain. Although alternative drugs with proven efficacy against <em>N. meningitidis</em> are available (eg, benzylpenicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, and intravenous or intramuscular chloramphenicol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>), protocols requiring multiple injections are impractical during an epidemic.</p><p>Thus, investigators in Niger evaluated the effectiveness of a single intramuscular dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> compared with oily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a> in a randomized noninferiority treatment trial in 503 individuals (441 under the age of 15) with suspected disease during the acute phase of a meningococcal meningitis epidemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The treatment failure rate and case-fatality rate at 72 hours were equivalent in both treatment groups (treatment failure 9 percent in both groups; case-fatality rate 6 percent with ceftriaxone compared with 5 percent with chloramphenicol). Results were similar with confirmed meningitis caused by <em>N. meningitidis</em>. As a result, ceftriaxone should be considered as an alternative first-line treatment to chloramphenicol for epidemic meningococcal meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H797496272\"><span class=\"h4\">Antibiotic agents</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h5\">Cephalosporins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Third-generation cephalosporins are the agents of choice for meningococcal infection prior to the availability of susceptibility testing and in patients with organisms that are not fully susceptible to penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Other situations in which cephalosporins may be the drugs of choice include cases in which access to skilled medical care is lacking (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> given twice daily would simplify dosing) and for patients with hypersensitivity reactions that preclude the use of penicillin. Third-generation cephalosporin are also a reasonable alternative to penicillin, even when the isolate is penicillin susceptible, given the excellent efficacy, convenient dosing, and affordability of these agents.</p><p>Meningococcal strains with decreased sensitivity to third-generation cephalosporins have been observed. In one study, approximately 2 percent of invasive meningococcal isolates between 2012 and 2015 in France demonstrated reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h5\">Penicillin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meningococcal meningitis is well treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> if the isolate is proven to be penicillin susceptible. Penicillin can be used if the isolate has a penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of &lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For isolates with a penicillin MIC of 0.1 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> treatment with high-dose penicillin is effective, but a third-generation cephalosporin is preferred.</p><p>Penicillin can be administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly. The usual dose is 300,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per day with an upper limit of 24 million <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span>. A typical regimen in adults is 4 million units IV every four hours. Penicillin should NEVER be administered intrathecally because of the danger of severe neurotoxicity.</p><p>The target cerebrospinal fluid penicillin concentration for the treatment of meningitis is approximately 10 times the minimum inhibitory concentration of the organism for that drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The first reports of <em>N. meningitidis</em> resistant to penicillin appeared in 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Relative resistance to penicillin is caused by a reduced binding affinity to specific penicillin-binding proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although such resistant meningococcal strains have been infrequently reported, clinicians should be alerted to the possibility of their occurrence in unexplained treatment failures or in cases of slowly resolving meningitis.

Evaluating the nature of the patient's beta-lactam allergy is crucial in a decision to avoid beta-lactam antibiotics in these critically ill patients.

During epidemics of meningococcal disease in resource-limited settings, a single intramuscular injection of long-acting chloramphenicol is often used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Conversely, chemoprophylaxis administered &gt;14 days after exposure to the index case is probably of limited or no value and is therefore <strong>not</strong> recommended. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regimens for antimicrobial prophylaxis have been defined by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51944 \">table 1</a>).

Thus, if other drugs have been used for treatment, the index patient should receive chemoprophylaxis for eradication of nasopharyngeal carriage before discharge from the hospital in order to prevent subsequent transmission to close contacts.
