Performance of a high-quality colonoscopy examination requires understanding and mastery of cognitive and technical skills. A joint American Society of Gastrointestinal <span class=\"nowrap\">Endoscopy/American</span> College of Gastroenterology Taskforce on Quality in Endoscopy advocated the following quality indicators before, during, and after colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] (see <a href=\"#H60870301\" class=\"local\">'Quality indicators'</a> below): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preprocedure &ndash; Attention must be paid to the general issues of timely scheduling, appropriate patient preparation, targeted history and physical examination, evaluation of bleeding risk, assessment for appropriate sedation, and team pause before commencing sedation. It is also important to understand appropriate indications and recommended surveillance intervals based upon the patient's risk factors (eg, family history of colorectal cancer, prior adenomatous polyps, hereditary colon cancer syndrome, or inflammatory bowel disease). Finally, obtaining informed consent with a detailed explanation of the risks associated with colonoscopy is essential. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraprocedure &ndash; Performing a high-quality examination requires careful visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. Metrics such as cecal intubation rates, withdrawal times, and adenoma detection rates serve as surrogate, though imperfect, markers of careful visualization. In addition, a high-quality examination requires appropriate tissue acquisition (eg, surveillance biopsies in inflammatory bowel disease) and endoscopic removal of all polyps less than 2 cm. Removal of polyps larger than 2 cm may require special endoscopic skills. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postprocedure<strong> </strong>&ndash; There must be immediate, complete, and accurate documentation (both written and photographic) of preparation quality and findings, as well as explicit recommendations for follow-up. Tissue samples taken during colonoscopy must be documented. Pathology results should be reviewed with results and recommendations communicated to the patient and referring providers. Finally, there should be a system for tracking complications. </p><p/><p>This topic will review factors associated with performing a colonoscopy including indications, patient preparation, technical aspects, and complications. Issues related to colon cancer screening recommendations, bowel preparations for colonoscopy, procedural sedation, and the management of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications in patients undergoing endoscopy are discussed separately.

Diagnostic indications include screening or surveillance for colon cancer, evaluating signs and symptoms suggestive of possible colonic or distal small bowel disease, assessing a response to treatment in patients with known colonic disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease), and evaluating abnormalities found on imaging studies. Therapeutic indications include stricture dilation, stent placement, colonic decompression, and foreign body removal. In addition, lesions found during diagnostic procedures may require therapeutic intervention (eg, polypectomy or treatment of a bleeding lesion). (See <a href=\"#H133249437\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening or surveillance for colon cancer &ndash; Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for colon cancer screening and surveillance. The age at which screening starts will depend upon the patient's medical and family history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59784\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59784 \">algorithm 1</a>). If polyps are found during colonoscopy, they should be removed endoscopically if possible.

In addition, unexplained iron deficiency anemia should be evaluated with colonoscopy, as colon cancer is an important cause of iron deficiency anemia in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Search for source of blood and iron loss'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower gastrointestinal symptoms &ndash; Colonoscopy should be performed in patients with chronic, clinically significant diarrhea without an explanation. Random colon biopsies should be obtained throughout the colon to rule out microscopic colitis. Colonoscopy is generally not indicated as part of the evaluation for chronic constipation unless warning signs are present (eg, anemia, weight loss) or the patient has not undergone recommended screening or surveillance. Whether to perform a colonoscopy in a patient with chronic abdominal pain will depend upon patient risk factors (eg, age &gt;50 years), the character and location of the pain, and associated signs and symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-chronic-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Colonoscopy versus sigmoidoscopy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of chronic constipation in adults&quot;, section on 'Endoscopy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal imaging &ndash; Colonoscopy is indicated to evaluate abnormalities detected on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema, abdominal computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography CT, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging studies. Radiographic findings requiring colonoscopic evaluation include thickening of the wall of the colon or terminal ileum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79520\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79520 \">image 1</a>), mass lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83618\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83618 \">figure 1</a>), filling defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75818\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75818 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82202\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82202 \">image 3</a>), and strictures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63411\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63411 \">image 4</a>). In addition, colonoscopy may be indicated in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary or who are found to have polyps on CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy), depending upon the size of the polyp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71187\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71187 \">picture 1</a>).

As a result, patients with colon cancer require a complete examination of the colon. Ideally, this is done prior to surgery, though in some patients complete preoperative colonoscopy will not be possible (eg, due to inability to pass the colonoscope beyond an obstructing tumor). Such patients require colonoscopy soon after resection of the primary tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance after colorectal cancer resection&quot;, section on 'Perioperative colonoscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Following treatment of the primary tumor, patients require routine surveillance to look for new polyps or metachronous cancer. Several expert groups have made recommendations regarding the timing and frequency of posttreatment endoscopic surveillance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F91699\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91699 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance after colorectal cancer resection&quot;, section on 'Postoperative endoscopic surveillance'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance after colorectal cancer resection&quot;, section on 'Guidelines from major groups'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative lesion localization &ndash; Colonoscopy may be performed intraoperatively to identify a lesion identified on imaging or prior colonoscopy that is not apparent at surgery, such as a bleeding site or small mass. For lesions previously identified with colonoscopy, intraoperative colonoscopy can often be avoided if the area with the lesion is marked during the colonoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77062%7EGAST%2F69334%7EGAST%2F78733\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77062 graphicRef69334 graphicRef78733 \">picture 2A-C</a>). In such cases, lesions are typically tattooed a few centimeters distal to the lesion. Exactly where the tattoo was performed in relationship to the lesion must be clearly documented and communicated to the surgeon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tattooing and other methods for localizing colonic lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory bowel disease &ndash; Colonoscopy is often performed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease to assess the extent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severity of disease and to assess treatment responses. In addition, patients with colitis require routine surveillance for colonic dysplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-and-management-of-dysplasia-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of the terminal ileum &ndash; In patients with suspected disease involving the distal small bowel, such as Crohn disease, carcinoid, and bleeding, colonoscopy can be used to evaluate the terminal ileum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic indications &ndash; Therapeutic indications for colonoscopy include foreign body removal, decompression of sigmoid volvulus or colonic pseudoobstruction, balloon dilation of strictures, palliative treatment of bleeding or stenosed neoplasms, and percutaneous endoscopic cecostomy tube placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectal-foreign-bodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectal foreign bodies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sigmoid-volvulus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sigmoid volvulus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-colonic-pseudo-obstruction-ogilvies-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of anastomotic complications of colorectal surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enteral-stents-for-the-management-of-malignant-colorectal-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enteral stents for the management of malignant colorectal obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133249373\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonoscopy is contraindicated in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the risks of the colonoscopy outweigh the expected benefits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consent cannot be obtained for a non-urgent procedure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A perforation is known or suspected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Documented acute diverticulitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fulminant colitis</p><p/><p>It is important that the expected benefits of colonoscopy be carefully weighed against the risks, particularly in older adults and patients with comorbid illnesses because these patients are at increased risk for serious complications from colonoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H133249458\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>If a patient cannot be adequately sedated despite a reasonable attempt at sedation, colonoscopy should be delayed until adequate sedation can be provided (eg, monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia). Finally, a suspected poor preparation is a relative contraindication to colonoscopy.

A low-residue diet is low in fiber, and patients should be instructed to avoid foods that are high in fiber such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51448 \">table 5</a>). Clear liquids include water, clear broth, coffee or tea (without milk), ices, gelatin, and fruit juices such as apple, grapefruit, and lemonade. Liquids that are red can be mistaken for blood in the colon or can obscure mucosal details and should be avoided. One trial found that there was no significant difference in preparation quality between patients treated with 4L of polyethylene glycol who were assigned to receive either a low-residue diet or clear liquids the day prior to the examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similarly, a randomized trial with 230 patients who were receiving a sodium sulfate-based preparation assigned patients to either a low-residue diet for breakfast and lunch the day prior to the colonoscopy or to clear liquids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Again, there was no difference between the groups with regard to preparation quality. However, patients in the low-residue arm reported greater satisfaction with the preparation and were less likely to cancel their procedure (9 versus 20 percent). Whether similar results would be seen outside of a randomized trial is not yet known. Our approach is to recommend a low-residue diet for five days prior to colonoscopy, with only clear liquids allowed the day prior to the examination.</p><p>Patients typically take no food by mouth for four to eight hours prior to the procedure (sometimes longer if there is known or suspected delayed gastric emptying) and no liquids (other than sips with medications) for two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Recommendations differ with regard to preprocedure fasting for elective procedures. The American Society for Anesthesiology (ASA) guidelines state that prior to a procedure, patients should fast a minimum of two hours following clear liquid ingestion or six hours for a light meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. By contrast, the American College of Emergency Physicians states &quot;recent food intake is not a contraindication for administering procedural sedation and analgesia, but should be considered in choosing the timing and target level of sedation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Our practice is to follow the ASA approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133249395\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most medications may be continued up to the time of colonoscopy and are taken with a small sip of water the day of the colonoscopy. Some medications may need to be adjusted prior to colonoscopy, such as medications for diabetes, due to decreased oral intake prior to the procedure. Oral iron should also be stopped at least five days before the colonoscopy since it makes the residual feces black, viscous, and difficult to purge. </p><p>Decisions regarding the management of antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants must weigh the risks of bleeding from the procedure with the probability of a thromboembolic event occurring while the antithrombotic medication is interrupted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50700\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50700 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77634 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Furthermore, the urgency of the procedure and the availability of alternative tests must be evaluated. Management decisions about antithrombotic agents should be made following discussion with the patient and the clinician prescribing the medication. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a>&nbsp;and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in standard doses may be continued safely in patients having colonoscopy.

Poor preparation leads to increased procedure time, risk of complications, and probability of missing lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Multiple bowel preparations exist, with the ideal preparation being effective, safe, and palatable.

This includes a complete history of factors that might make sedation more difficult such as prior difficulties with sedation, chronic narcotic or benzodiazepine use, diminished mental capacity, and agitation or severe anxiety. Special attention should be paid to whether the patient has an increased risk for difficult airway management (eg, obesity, non-visibility of the uvula, prior history of difficult intubation) or increased cardiopulmonary complications of endoscopy (eg, comorbidities, obesity, older age). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternatives-and-adjuncts-to-moderate-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alternatives and adjuncts to moderate procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Although deep sedation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> is associated with greater patient satisfaction, faster post-procedure recovery time, and in some studies shorter procedure time, it does not lead to improvements in other clinically important outcomes such as cecal intubation rates or adenoma detection rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Use of anesthesia during colonoscopy may be associated with increased complications, including perforation following polypectomy, bleeding, abdominal pain, and complications associated with anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Furthermore, when administered by an anesthesiologist or dedicated nurse, deep sedation substantially increases the total cost of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It is important to note that in some cases the additional costs associated with the administration of deep sedation may not be covered by a patient's health insurance.

Incidences of possible complications should be mentioned. (See <a href=\"#H133249458\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Written documentation of the consent process is mandatory. In addition, when needed, the use of translators and materials written in a language in which the patient is fluent are also important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60870331\"><span class=\"h1\">EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine colonoscopy is performed using a high-definition white-light colonoscope. Both adult and pediatric colonoscopes are used for colonoscopy in adults (with pediatric colonoscopes often being used for women or patients with a history of abdominal surgery). The choice of colonoscope does not affect cecal intubation rates or times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Adult colonoscopes have a diameter of approximately 13 mm, whereas pediatric colonoscopes have a diameter of approximately 11 mm. Use of a pediatric colonoscope may enable easier passage through narrowed or fixed areas of the colon. However, the smaller diameter makes the pediatric colonoscope more flexible, which predisposes to loop formation. The choice of an adult versus pediatric colonoscope is typically a matter of endoscopist preference. Occasionally the endoscopist may need to change from one type of colonoscope to the other to facilitate completion of the colonoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H63022593\" class=\"local\">'Looping'</a> below.) An ultra-slim colonoscope with a diameter of 9.5 mm may be particularly helpful in patients with tight turns. </p><p>Variable stiffness colonoscopes allow the endoscopist to stiffen the shaft of the colonoscope and appear to increase cecal intubation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Often the colonoscope is stiffened after passage through the sigmoid colon to reduce loop formation. The colonoscope is typically loosened during withdrawal, retroflexion, or passage around tight turns.</p><p>Various accessories are available that can be passed through the accessory channel of a colonoscope. These include biopsy forceps, brushes, snares, baskets, nets, injection needles, hemostatic clips, and argon plasma coagulation probes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60870338\"><span class=\"h1\">COLONOSCOPE ADVANCEMENT AND MUCOSAL INSPECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonoscopy routinely begins with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, with the exception of patients with a colostomy, who typically remain supine. The first step is inspection of the perianal region and digital rectal examination. Topical anesthetic lubricating gel should be used for patients with perianal discomfort, whereas standard lubricant can be used for patients without discomfort. The tip of the colonoscope is then inserted into the rectum with air insufflation, suctioning of residual fluid, and pulling back of the colonoscope to enable visualization. The rectosigmoid junction is at approximately 15 to 20 cm, at which point the colon enters the peritoneum. Particular care must be taken when advancing the colonoscope in patients with colonic strictures or significant diverticulosis, as air insufflation can increase the risk of perforation in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H133249479\" class=\"local\">'Perforation'</a> below.)</p><p>Important techniques used during colonoscopy include using the up-down and left-right knobs and aspirating air. Using the knobs is particularly helpful in negotiating turns. Although gentle air insufflation helps visualization as the colonoscope is advanced, filling the colon with air lengthens and distends the colon, which may cause discomfort and increase the difficulty of the procedure. Aspirating the air will deflate and shorten the colon, bringing the next fold closer to the tip of the colonoscope, reducing abdominal discomfort and often aiding with scope advancement. The use of carbon dioxide instead of air to insufflate may reduce distension and patient discomfort as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although limited data suggest that carbon dioxide insufflation in patients with underlying pulmonary disease is not associated with an increased risk of respiratory depression or carbon dioxide retention, additional studies are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. </p><p>Distending the lumen of the colon with water may facilitate advancement of the colonoscope with decreased pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. This technique may be especially helpful when navigating a left colon filled with numerous diverticula that make it difficult to identify the colonic lumen. Studies support decreased sedation requirements and improved patient tolerance with the use of water rather than air insufflation; however, other studies suggest decreased adenoma detection rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/29,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31-33</a>]. In a meta-analysis with 16 randomized trials that compared insufflation with water and insufflation with air, insufflation with water was associated with less pain (-1.57 point difference in pain score on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI -2.00 to -1.14), a higher likelihood of being able to complete the examination without sedation or analgesia (risk ratio [RR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.27), and higher adenoma detection rates (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.30) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. There was no difference in cecal intubation rate.</p><p>Intubating the terminal ileum can be performed with two different approaches. The colonoscope may be advanced through the opening of the valve by direct visualization during forward movement. Alternatively, the colonoscope may be positioned in the cecum near the appendiceal orifice and slowly withdrawn, with the tip of the colonoscope angled toward the direction of the valve opening in an attempt to &quot;hook&quot; the valve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63022593\"><span class=\"h2\">Looping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major barrier to successful advancement of the colonoscope to the cecum is looping. Looping occurs due to the attachment of the sigmoid and transverse colon to a mobile mesentery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82950 \">figure 2</a>). Advancing the colonoscope becomes more difficult, and in some cases, attempts to advance the colonoscope result in reverse movement of the colonoscope tip, termed paradoxical movement. In addition to impeding advancement of the colonoscope, looping can cause pain and perforation. Pain occurs due to the presence of sensory receptors in the mesentery responding to torsion, distension, compression, and stretching. Repeated loop reduction during the colonoscopy is critical and requires pulling back the colonoscope while applying torque, often clockwise. Stopping any maneuver if it causes significant pain, pressure, or difficulty is important to decrease the risk of complications. Loops formed in the instrument shaft outside the patient should be removed by rotating the colonoscope, keeping the lumen in view.</p><p>Applying abdominal pressure and changing the patient's position are important adjunctive techniques to enable passage of the colonoscope to the cecum. Abdominal pressure was the most important non-instrumental factor for cecal intubation in patients referred for incomplete colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Loops should be removed before the assistant applies pressure to help prevent loop further formation. </p><p>Asking the patient to demonstrate the location of abdominal discomfort may also help identify the appropriate area to apply pressure. In addition, abdominal pressure should be applied to abdominal hernias. In such patients, loops that form within the hernia may lead to entrapment of the colonoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>While not widely available, an alternative method for determining where to apply pressure is magnetic endoscopic imaging. Magnetic endoscopic imaging provides real-time three-dimensional views of the colonoscope shaft configuration and its location within the abdomen. This information can aid with loop reduction and can be used to identify where to provide external pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnetic-endoscopic-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnetic endoscopic imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Changing the patient's position also may aid advancement of the colonoscope. In addition to the standard left lateral position, patients may be positioned in a supine, right lateral, or prone position. One study demonstrated that position changes were effective two-thirds of the time in allowing forward advancement of the colonoscope or improved luminal visualization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63022615\"><span class=\"h2\">Inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful inspection of the colonic mucosa is primarily performed during withdrawal of the colonoscope. In addition to polyps (and tumors if present), the presence of erythema, erosions, ulcers, diverticula, melanosis coli, hemorrhoids, and condyloma should be noted. A withdrawal time of at least six minutes improves adenoma detection rates, but inspection technique appears to be as important as time spent inspecting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. The following techniques are important for ensuring optimal visualization:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleaning the colon of residual fluid during insertion and withdrawal.

Identifying position by the distances marked on the shaft of the colonoscope is not reliable due to looping, although approximately 60 to 80 cm of the instrument will typically be inserted upon reaching the cecum once loops have been removed. Only the terminal ileum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83345\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83345 \">picture 4</a>), cecum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83347\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83347 \">picture 5</a>), and rectum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83343\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83343 \">picture 6</a>) can be recognized 100 percent of the time by experienced endoscopists. The appendiceal orifice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83339\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83339 \">picture 7</a>) and ileocecal valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83342\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83342 \">picture 8</a>) with two lipomatous lips identify the cecum. Care must be taken not to confuse the cecum with a tight turn or the appendiceal orifice with a diverticulum. The hepatic and splenic flexures may be identified by the bluish hue of adjacent organs (the liver and spleen, respectively) visualized through the colonic mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83341\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83341 \">picture 9</a>). The transverse colon typically has a triangular fold configuration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83346\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83346 \">picture 10</a>).</p><p>Multiple options are available to enhance visualization during colonoscopy, though many require specialized equipment and training. These techniques include narrow band imaging, magnification endoscopy, chromoendoscopy, and confocal laser endomicroscopy. These techniques are not routinely used but may be employed in certain circumstances (eg, detecting dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnification-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnification endoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chromoendoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chromoendoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Full-spectrum colonoscopes are also being developed to improve visualization during colonoscopy. These colonoscopes include imagers not only on the tip of the colonoscope, but also on the sides (providing a 330 degree angle of view).

Tissue sampling includes biopsies, brushings, and polypectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Specimens obtained can be sent for histology, cytology, microbiology, or virology, depending upon the clinical situation. When submitting samples, the endoscopist should provide the pathologist, cytologist, or microbiologist with the patient's clinical history, endoscopic findings, and questions to be answered.

Small polyps may be completely removed using biopsy forceps, while larger polyps require snare resection, with or without electrocautery. Advanced endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection techniques are used for large polyps (typically greater than 2 cm) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62455\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62455 \">picture 13</a>). Nearly all pedunculated polyps without invasive cancer can be removed endoscopically. If polyps are too numerous for removal, representative samples should be obtained.

In a review of 12 studies with 57,742 screening colonoscopies, serious harm occurred in 2.8 per 1000 examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Over 85 percent of the complications occurred in the setting of polypectomy. In a second study that used a database with 2.3 million colonoscopies performed between 1997 and 2004, the overall rate of complications resulting in hospitalization was 1.98 per 1000 examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A third study pooled data from 21 studies with nearly 2 million colonoscopies from 2001 to 2012 and reported perforation in 0.5 per 1000 colonoscopies, post-colonoscopy bleeding in 2.6 per 1000 colonoscopies and death in 2.9 per 100,000 colonoscopies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The mortality rate related to colonoscopy is 0.007 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>However, the risk of colonoscopy is not constant across groups. Older adults are at increased risk for serious complications compared with younger patients. In a study of 53,220 colonoscopies, patients aged 80 to 84 years had a higher rate of serious complications compared with patients aged 66 to 69 years (8.8 per 1000 procedures versus 5.0 per 1000 procedures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The risk of serious complications was also increased among patients with comorbid conditions such as a history of stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133249465\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications related to sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiopulmonary complications are the most frequent complication related to procedural sedation. Reducing the risk of sedation-associated complications requires appropriate anesthesia risk assessment of patients; management of high-risk patients by qualified medical personnel; appropriate monitoring before, during, and after the procedure; and delay of non-urgent procedures in unstable patients. Complications related to procedural sedation are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-events-related-to-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse events related to procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133249472\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications related to preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All bowel preparations can cause adverse effects, which include fluid and electrolyte disturbances, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, abdominal discomfort, aspiration, and esophageal tears from vomiting. Complications related to the various colonoscopy preparations are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bowel preparation before colonoscopy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70098074\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding is usually associated with polypectomy and rarely accompanies diagnostic colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The reported rates of postpolypectomy bleeding vary (typically 1 to 2 percent), with higher rates seen with the removal of larger polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/51-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-58</a>]. The risk of postpolypectomy bleeding may be increased in patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathies. It has been suggested that overall, endoscopists should have postpolypectomy bleeding rates of less than one percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition to the increased risk seen with polypectomy, the risk of bleeding is increased with other therapeutic maneuvers such as stricture dilation and endoscopic mucosal resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-procedures-in-patients-with-disorders-of-hemostasis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic procedures in patients with disorders of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Procedure-related bleeding risk'</a>.)</p><p>Postpolypectomy bleeding may be immediate or delayed. Immediate bleeding is associated with polypectomy techniques that do not use cautery or when blended (instead of coagulation) current is used for polypectomy. It often is recognized during the colonoscopy, in which case it typically can be treated immediately using endoscopic hemostatic methods. If not recognized at the time of colonoscopy, it can usually be managed by a repeat colonoscopy to identify and treat the bleeding site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bleeding after colonic polypectomy&quot;, section on 'Immediate bleeding'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoclip therapy in the gastrointestinal tract: Bleeding lesions and beyond&quot;, section on 'Postpolypectomy bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>Delayed bleeding is typically seen five to seven days after the procedure, but it has been reported up to 29 days later. It is thought to occur due to sloughing of an eschar that was covering a blood vessel or due to extension of the zone of thermal necrosis to non-injured tissue, which could result in bleeding if it involves a blood vessel. Patients may present with hematochezia or with melena, depending upon the location of the bleeding (bleeding from the right colon may present as melena). As with immediate bleeding, delayed bleeding can often be managed with colonoscopy to identify and treat the bleeding site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleeding-after-colonic-polypectomy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bleeding after colonic polypectomy&quot;, section on 'Delayed bleeding'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133249479\"><span class=\"h2\">Perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perforations typically occur by one of three mechanisms: (1) mechanical trauma from pressure exerted by the colonoscope on the wall of the colon (often in the rectosigmoid region) or at the site of a stricture; (2) barotrauma, where pressure in the colon exceeds the bursting pressure of a colonic region (typically the cecum); or (3) from electrocautery injury during polypectomy. Perforation rates during colonoscopy vary with the procedure being performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/46,47,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47,59</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening colonoscopy: 0.01 to 0.1 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anastomotic stricture dilation: 0 to 6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crohn disease stricture dilation: 0 to 18 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stent placement: 4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonic decompression tube placement: 2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonic endoscopic mucosal resection 0 to 5 percent</p><p/><p>Due to the mechanism of injury (mechanical trauma or barotrauma), perforations from a diagnostic colonoscopy are typically large. On the other hand, perforations from a therapeutic colonoscopy may be small and located at the site of the therapeutic intervention, though such patients may also suffer perforations due to mechanical trauma or barotrauma.</p><p>Mortality rates from iatrogenic colonic perforation range from 0 to 0.65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Risk factors for perforation include advanced age, multiple comorbidities, diverticulosis, obstruction, resection of polyps over 1 cm in size that are located in the right colon, and other therapeutic maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/46,47,58,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47,58,61,62</a>]. Anesthesia for sedation may increase the risk of perforation compared with moderate procedural sedation (eg, with a narcotic and benzodiazepine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/20,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,63</a>]. However, other studies have not noted this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/62,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,64,65</a>]. Additional risk factors for perforation include reduced mobility of the colon, existing weakness in the colon wall, previous incomplete attempt at endoscopic removal of a colonic lesion, performance of colonoscopy by a non-gastroenterologist, and endoscopist inexperience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/47,62,66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,62,66-69</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced colon mobility can result from adhesions, diverticula, radiation therapy, malignancy, or infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucosal abnormalities may occur as a result of inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, infection, radiation therapy, necrosis, or a partial tear.

(See <a href=\"#H60870301\" class=\"local\">'Quality indicators'</a> below.)</p><p>Techniques to decrease the risk of perforation include creating a fluid cushion by injection of submucosal fluid underneath large or flat polyps before resection, avoiding dilation in patients with significant inflammation in the area to be dilated, minimizing air insufflation during placement of a colonic stent, and avoiding colonic stent placement in patients who are or will be receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/45,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,70</a>].

Colonic perforation may be retro- or intraperitoneal. The ascending colon, hepatic and splenic flexures, and descending colon are retroperitoneal, whereas the distal rectum is below the peritoneum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81248 \">figure 3</a>). The most common symptom of a colonic perforation is abdominal pain. Other symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, chest pain, scapular pain, and neck pain. However, patients with retroperitoneal perforations may have minimal or atypical symptoms. The physical examination may be notable for diffuse or localized abdominal tenderness with peritoneal signs.</p><p>If perforation is suspected, immediate abdominal radiographs (plain and upright or lateral decubitus) and an upright chest radiograph should be obtained to look for free air under the diaphragm, retroperitoneal air, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, or subcutaneous emphysema. If plain films are normal but there is a high suspicion of perforation, an abdominopelvic computed tomography scan with water-soluble contrast should be obtained since it has higher sensitivity for detecting extraluminal air than plain films (particularly for retroperitoneal perforations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-tract-perforation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal tract perforation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Management includes giving the patient nothing by mouth and starting intravenous fluids and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics. Surgical consultation should be obtained immediately. Large perforations typically require surgery. A minority of patients can be managed nonsurgically. Such patients have a clean colon with no signs of peritonitis and improve symptomatically over 24 hours. Usually these patients have a retroperitoneal perforation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sustained the perforation during a therapeutic colonoscopy. Reported success rates for nonsurgical management are variable (between 33 to 64 percent in some series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. Successful endoscopic clip closure of perforations has been reported and may be attempted if the perforation is visualized at the time of the colonoscopy and is accessible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].

Adenoma detection rates are calculated based upon screening colonoscopies in asymptomatic patients &ge;50 years of age who are at average risk for colon polyps and colon cancer. In addition, adenoma detection rates are based only upon complete examinations with adequate preparations. The goal of applying quality indicators is to improve colonoscopy performance and decrease the number of lesions (particularly adenomas) missed during colonoscopy.

The endoscopists' adenoma detection rates were associated with the risk of developing an interval colorectal cancer. The rates of interval colorectal cancer were 34 per 100,000 person-years for endoscopists with an adenoma detection rate &lt;11 percent, 22 per 100,000 person-years with an adenoma detection rate of 11 to 14.9 percent, 26 per 100,000 person-years with an adenoma detection rate of 15 to 19.9 percent, and 2 per 100,000 person-years with an adenoma detection rate &ge;20 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study looked at 314,872 colonoscopies performed for various indications in patients &ge;50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Adenoma detection rates were calculated based on screening examinations, but did not take into account preparation quality or whether the cecum was reached during the examination. Adenoma detection rates ranged from 7.4 to 52 percent. The rates of interval cancer declined linearly with increasing adenoma detection rate. For endoscopists with an adenoma detection rate of &le;19 percent, there were 98 interval cancers per 100,000 person-years, whereas for endoscopists with an adenoma detection rate of &ge;33.5 percent, the rate was 48 per 100,000 person-years. After adjusting for confounders, the risk of interval cancer decreased 3 percent for every 1 percent increase in adenoma detection rate (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.98).</p><p/><p>Colorectal cancers may also be missed during colonoscopy. Studies suggest that colonoscopy will miss 2 to 6 percent of colorectal cancers.

Most medications may be continued up to the time of colonoscopy, but management of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants must take into account the procedure-related risk of bleeding and the risk of thrombosis. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not required for patients undergoing colonoscopy.

Postpolypectomy bleeding occurs in approximately 1 to 2 percent of polypectomies, with higher rates seen with the removal of larger polyps. Patients may present with hematochezia or melena days to weeks after the colonoscopy. The majority of patients can be managed with a repeat colonoscopy to both identify and treat the source of bleeding.

The most common symptom of a colonic perforation is abdominal pain. Other symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, chest pain, scapular pain, and neck pain. However, patients with retroperitoneal perforations may have minimal or atypical symptoms. The physical examination may be notable for diffuse or localized abdominal tenderness with peritoneal signs. (See <a href=\"#H133249479\" class=\"local\">'Perforation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If perforation is suspected, immediate abdominal radiographs (plain and upright or lateral decubitus) and an upright chest radiograph should be obtained. If plain films are normal but there is a high suspicion of perforation, an abdominopelvic computed tomography scan with water-soluble contrast should be obtained. All patients with perforations should receive intravenous fluids and broad spectrum antibiotics. Many patients with perforations will require surgery, though nonsurgical management may be possible in those with small perforations without evidence of peritonitis.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bjorkman DJ, Popp JW Jr. Measuring the quality of endoscopy.
