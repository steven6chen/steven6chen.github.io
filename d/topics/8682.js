Dissemination may occur by direct extension from the primary site, by lymphatic spread to regional lymph nodes, or hematogenously. Almost all patients who die from melanoma do so with disseminated disease involving multiple organs; lung and intracranial metastases are the most frequent cause of death.</p><p>Imaging studies play an essential role in the initial staging and subsequent management of patients with melanoma by evaluating the extent of disease, detecting clinically occult disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> determining the response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The imaging modalities useful in patients with melanoma are reviewed here.</p><p>Topics summarizing the application of information from imaging studies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging work-up and surveillance after treatment of melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of advanced cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1956140\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING MODALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various imaging modalities can be used to assess the extent of disease at presentation, detect recurrence after initial treatment, or monitor disease progression and response to treatment during the course of a patient's illness.</p><p>Most radiology departments have established protocols for imaging neoplastic disease. Although the referring clinician is not expected to know the details of specific protocols when ordering imaging studies, consultation with the radiologist may assist in optimizing the use of imaging studies for patient management decisions.</p><p>This section will review the primary imaging modalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1956146\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain chest radiographs (&quot;x-rays&quot;) are inexpensive and use a relatively low radiation dose equivalent to the background radiation a person would receive from the environment in less than two weeks. (See <a href=\"#H1957511\" class=\"local\">'Radiation exposure'</a> below.) </p><p>Chest radiographs have a relatively poor sensitivity for the detection of early (small) lung metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, chest radiographs often are obtained prior to initial definitive therapy as a baseline for comparison with future studies. Most patients with suspected metastatic disease will be evaluated with more sensitive and specific imaging procedures, such as positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/computed</span> tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1956178\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography (CT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT imaging is used to image the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and may also have a role in brain imaging when MRI is either not available or contraindicated. CT is frequently combined with PET to increase sensitivity and specificity. (See <a href=\"#H1956366\" class=\"local\">'PET and PET/CT'</a> below.)</p><p>Newer, more rapid CT scanning techniques are less prone to bowel and respiratory motion artifacts during imaging, enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of CT scanning. Reported results vary widely, and results with older equipment or techniques do not reflect results that can be obtained with current generation scanners.</p><p>CT scans can be done with or without contrast, and contrast can be administered intravenously, orally, or via both routes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral contrast administration is very helpful to distinguish bowel from nodes, vessels, female reproductive organs, and other structures in the abdomen and pelvis. However, high-density oral contrast agents can obscure the bowel wall, making bowel wall metastases more difficult to see. Low-density, water-based contrast agents or even plain water can be used, which allow excellent visualization of the bowel wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous contrast agents improve the detection rate substantially compared with noncontrast CT. Metastatic melanoma is typically hypervascular, with lesions appearing hyperdense compared with surrounding tissue on early-phase contrast-enhanced CT. Disadvantages of intravenous contrast agents include potential allergic reactions and renal damage. The risk of allergic reactions can often be decreased by using nonionic contrast agents and by avoiding contrast injection in patients with a history of allergies. While renal toxicity secondary to iodinated contrast is rare in patients with normally functioning kidneys, it is a significant risk in patients with preexisting diminished renal function or congestive heart failure.</p><p/><p>Multiple-phase imaging consists of several sets of CT images obtained at different times following contrast injection; this technique is necessary to maximize the accuracy of CT for metastatic melanoma. Hypervascular lesions, such as melanoma metastases, have characteristic patterns of contrast wash-in and wash-out using this technique. For melanoma metastases, CT can be optimized with two image sets, one prior to contrast injection and the other during the portal venous phase (60 seconds following the start of contrast injection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10576354\"><span class=\"h2\">MRI AND PET/MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI is a sensitive, specific test for imaging melanoma, particularly in the brain, with T1 shortening and hypointensity on short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences correlating with the melanin content of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, whole-body imaging with MRI is often not practical and is less sensitive than fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>MRI is used more frequently to better define the anatomic extent of metastases that may not be delineated by other imaging tests, such as CT and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT,</span> particularly in the brain. Because MRI with contrast enhancement is the most sensitive test for imaging brain metastases, it is the procedure of choice for patients with symptoms suggesting brain metastases, as well as for those with aggressive histology and clinical findings that may make brain metastasis more likely.</p><p>Patients presenting emergently with symptoms suggesting central nervous system (CNS) disease will often have a CT scan as the initial exam because a CT is usually less expensive, easier to perform, and often adequate to diagnose the cause of the presenting symptoms. Because MRI is more sensitive for brain metastases than contrast-enhanced CT, brain MRI may be obtained in patients with CT-documented CNS disease if additional information about the number or location of lesions in the brain may affect management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of brain metastases in melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">PET/MRI</span> or whole-body MRI may replace <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> in some instances to become the procedure of choice for whole-body staging of melanoma, as well as for following response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The advantage of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/MRI</span> is reduction in radiation dose, an important consideration as cancer survivorship increases. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/MRI</span> may also be more sensitive for melanoma metastasis in some tissues such as bone and liver, it but does not do as well as <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> for evaluation of lung and lymph node metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The improved accuracy of MRI over <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> for imaging melanoma metastases in some tissues must be weighed against the cost and availability of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/MRI</span> as well as the small incremental benefit. Because <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is very accurate, a small improvement in sensitivity outside the brain may often not be of clinical consequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Because whole-body MRI and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/MRI</span> are relatively new technologies and not yet as widely available as <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT,</span> their role in the management of patients with melanoma remains to be defined. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1956359\"><span class=\"h2\">Nuclear medicine techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomic detail provided by CT and MRI is complemented by the physiologic information provided by nuclear medicine studies, including <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> for staging and following response to therapy, as well as lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel lymph node localization.</p><p>Other nuclear medicine modalities, such as gallium scans and bone scans, were used in the past for detecting occult disease; however, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> has almost entirely replaced these techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1956366\"><span class=\"h3\">PET and PET/CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose labeled with the positron emitter fluorine-18 (fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]) is transported into cells and phosphorylated by hexokinase similarly to unlabeled glucose. However, FDG-6-phosphate cannot continue through the glycolytic or gluconeogenic pathways and is trapped inside the cell. The greater metabolic demands of many neoplastic tissues and increased numbers of passive glucose cell membrane transport gateways facilitate concentration of FDG in neoplastic tissues such as melanoma, compared with normal tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>PET cameras image the three-dimensional distribution of positron-emitting tracers in the body, such as fluorine-18 FDG. When combined with CT imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT),</span> the metabolic information from the PET scan is fused with the anatomic information from CT. As a result, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> detects metastases more accurately than CT or PET alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/9,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14-16</a>]. Preliminary reports also suggest that PET may be useful to monitor the response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>In patients with advanced disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is at least as sensitive and is more specific than anatomic imaging modalities such as CT and MRI for the detection of metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>]. Sensitivity is highest (90 percent or better) for metastases that are greater than 1 cm in diameter, but tumor deposits as small as 0.6 cm can be reliably seen in areas of low background activity, such as the lungs.</p><p>The reported specificity for PET ranges from 43 to 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/19,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24,25</a>]. False-positive results may be due to inflammation (recent surgery, infection, granulomatous disease), uptake in skeletal muscle, brown fat or myocardium, immune response, normal activity in the bowel and urinary collecting system, or attenuation artifacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/12,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,26-28</a>]. False negatives are seen with bone marrow stimulation and in nodes adjacent to brown fat uptake. Normal bowel concentration of tracer may obscure bowel metastases. The specificity of PET (lack of false positives) has improved substantially with the addition of CT to PET <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span>. Since the development of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanners, PET-only scanners have virtually disappeared, although much of the early literature on PET is based on PET-only imaging machines.</p><p>There are multiple ways to do a CT scan during <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span>. Some institutions prefer to do a full diagnostic CT scan as part of the <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> study, including contrast administration. This approach allows the patient to avoid returning for an additional imaging procedure at a separate date, but it results in a higher radiation dose for all patients undergoing the procedure. At many institutions, the CT portion of the <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is a low-dose scan for attenuation correction and general localization of disease. Although there is radiation exposure associated with the addition of a radiotracer such as FDG, the total radiation dose for a <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> carried out with low-dose CT scan can be less than half that of a diagnostic CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1957511\" class=\"local\">'Radiation exposure'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1956713\"><span class=\"h3\">SPECT/CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Single-photon emission computed tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(SPECT)/CT</span> provides anatomic information from CT that can be fused with physiologic information, such as lymphatic drainage patterns from Tc-99m-labeled lymphoscintigraphy agents for sentinel node imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">SPECT/CT</span> is particularly valuable for revealing the depth of nodal uptake and identifying adjacent structures prior to sentinel lymph node excision. (See <a href=\"#H1958502\" class=\"local\">'Lymph node evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Examples of situations in which <span class=\"nowrap\">SPECT/CT</span> may be particularly valuable include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melanomas of the head and neck region &ndash; The lymphatic drainage in the head and neck region is quite variable, and it is not unusual for the injection site to be in close proximity to the sentinel node. <span class=\"nowrap\">SPECT/CT</span> can not only improve node detection accuracy, but also demonstrate anatomic information to assist the surgeon in planning the approach to lymphadenectomy, which may result in a net cost savings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sentinel nodes in the inguinal region &ndash; In patients with melanoma of the lower extremities, sentinel node imaging often demonstrates several sites of tracer uptake in the inguinal region of the ipsilateral leg. In contrast to planar imaging, <span class=\"nowrap\">SPECT/CT</span> can easily distinguish superficial inguinal nodes, which can be readily biopsied, from intrapelvic nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In-transit nodes &ndash; Focal uptake of tracer outside the typical node beds, such as in the back, along the arm, or in the chest wall, may be seen with in-transit nodes. In these cases, the location of the site of uptake can again be important in surgical planning. As an example, <span class=\"nowrap\">SPECT/CT</span> imaging will more readily separate periscapular in-transit nodes from axillary nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F106096\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef106096 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1957511\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is concern about excessive exposure to ionizing radiation with medical imaging studies. Inappropriate application of various imaging techniques may not always improve patient outcomes and may increase the cost of health care and the exposure to ionizing radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>These issues need to be considered whenever a discussion of radiographic imaging is undertaken. However, when imaging is used judiciously in patients with melanoma, the theoretical risks associated with radiation exposures are expected to be outweighed by the benefits gained from more accurate staging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1957558\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO PATIENT IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiologic evaluation should be focused rather than exhaustive. Specific recommendations on the role and extent of imaging studies in patients with newly diagnosed melanoma and following initial definitive therapy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging work-up and surveillance after treatment of melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Melanoma commonly metastasizes to regional nodes and skin. Disseminated metastases are also often found in the lungs, brain, bowel, and a variety of other tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The differential diagnosis for unsuspected lesions found anywhere on imaging studies in patients with known melanoma almost always includes melanoma. Although characteristic imaging features can help narrow the differential diagnosis, definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1958502\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymph node evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional lymph node involvement is the most important prognostic factor at presentation for patients without distant metastases. Determination of nodal status is also critical for decision-making regarding adjuvant therapy. Lymphoscintigraphy with sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the standard approach for assessment of regional lymph node involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma&quot;, section on 'Eighth edition AJCC TNM staging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Physical examination is an inaccurate predictor of nodal metastases; 20 percent of clinically node-negative patients have metastatic deposits, while 20 percent of those who are clinically node-positive have pathologically negative nodes. Microscopic disease associated with early lymphatic metastasis currently cannot be detected by any in vivo imaging modality, including fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), or nodal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1958666\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphoscintigraphy and subclinical adenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLN biopsy can provide important information that influences patient management and prognosis.</p><p>The SLN hypothesis maintains that tumor cells migrating from a primary tumor colonize the first (sentinel) node(s) receiving lymphatic drainage from the primary tumor site before involving other nodes. While cutaneous lymphatic drainage pathways follow a generally predictable route to specific node beds, the specific node to first receive lymphatic flow within each node bed (the &quot;sentinel node&quot;) is difficult to determine using anatomic imaging techniques. In addition, the typical drainage pathways can vary substantially from person to person and region to region, with some areas of the skin draining to multiple lymph node beds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The pattern of lymphatic drainage is most accurately demonstrated by lymphoscintigraphy, which uses a radioactive colloid injected alone or in combination with local injection of blue dye (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, isosulfan blue). The SLN biopsy can provide important information that directly influences patient management and prognosis. Intradermal injection of radioactive tracer around the primary tumor permits identification of sentinel node(s) in the majority of patients with the use of gamma camera imaging and a handheld gamma probe at the time of surgery. Once the site of sentinel node(s) is identified with the gamma camera, it may be marked on the skin by the imaging physician before the patient is sent to surgery. The images should accompany the patient to the operating room, where the surgeon, with the aid of the images, skin markings, and a handheld gamma probe, can localize the sentinel nodes at the time of surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51978\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51978 \">picture 1</a>). If the sentinel node is negative for metastasis, the remaining regional nodes are very likely to be negative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1959517\"><span class=\"h3\">SLN biopsy procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional lymphatic assessment is typically performed at the same time as wide local excision of the primary tumor. The procedure begins with the intradermal injection of a radiolabeled tracer within 1.5 cm of the primary lesion. Proper injection technique usually is accompanied by the development of a tense wheal as the tracer is injected. </p><p>Because the tracer is injected intradermally, patients may experience an uncomfortable burning at the site of injection for several seconds. Otherwise, the procedure is well tolerated by most patients. The tracer is subsequently picked up by the local lymphatic channels and is then deposited in the nodal tissue receiving lymphatic flow from the site of injection. The SLN is often detected within 10 to 30 minutes of injection.</p><p>Focal uptake of tracer can then be imaged using planar images with a standard nuclear medicine gamma camera, with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or with SPECT done concurrently with CT <span class=\"nowrap\">(SPECT/CT)</span> for more precise localization of the site and depth of tracer uptake before the patient enters the surgical suite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/35,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,47</a>]. Typical images obtained are shown in the figures, using lymphoscintigraphy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76429\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76429 \">image 2</a>) and <span class=\"nowrap\">SPECT/CT</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82528\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82528 \">image 3</a>).</p><p>When the primary lesion is located on the trunk, imaging should include both axillary and inguinal node beds because of the variability of lymphatic drainage. The area between the injection site and sentinel node bed(s) should also be surveyed for in-transit nodes. In-transit nodes can also be seen with injection of a primary lesion on the extremities. Crossover to contralateral node beds is rare (eg, right leg draining to left inguinal or left iliac nodes) but should be considered when obtaining images.</p><p>Care must be taken to image all nodal basins that may drain the site of the primary lesion, as SLNs in more than one nodal basin are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Unusual patterns of tracer concentration or unusual sites of nodal uptake should be directly communicated to the surgeon, as should the timing of the appearance of nodes. If several nodes accumulate tracer in a nodal basin, it may be helpful to note which one(s) accumulated the tracer first. Flow images obtained with the gamma camera can assist in providing this information.</p><p>Focal areas of tracer uptake may then be marked on the overlying skin by the nuclear medicine clinician for assistance with the initial guidance of the handheld gamma probe during surgery. Although surgery can be delayed for up to 24 hours following tracer injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], radioactive decay of the tracer and movement of the tracer through the SLN to secondary nodes are potential problems if surgery is delayed, particularly if smaller colloid particles or albumin are injected. If surgery is planned for the day after tracer injection and imaging, the nuclear medicine clinician should be notified. An increase in the injected dose of tracer and scheduling the patient for later in the afternoon will lessen the problems associated with radioactive decay of the tracer.</p><p>Visualizing the sentinel node with the gamma camera or locating it with the intraoperative probe can be particularly difficult when the injection site is close to the draining node or node bed. This problem is often encountered with head and neck lesions. In these cases, injecting a smaller volume of injectate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a smaller amount of tracer activity close to the primary lesion (within 0.5 cm) can sometimes make resection of the injected material around the primary lesion easier and, subsequently, allow easier localization of the sentinel node with the intraoperative probe. <span class=\"nowrap\">SPECT/CT</span> may also be particularly useful for separating the injection site from adjacent nodes.</p><p>In experienced hands, the procedural false-negative rate (the inability to identify a SLN that contains tumor) is typically 5 percent or less. Procedural false negatives should be distinguished from biologic false negatives, in which regional lymph node relapses are seen following biopsy of a true negative SLN.</p><p>Causes of false-negative studies using lymphoscintigraphy for SLN localization include inadequate pathologic examination of the SLN, poor tracer injection technique, imaging the wrong nodal basin, failure to detect in non-transit nodes, not imaging all possible nodal basins, and complete replacement of the SLN with neoplastic disease, causing the injected tracer to completely bypass the infiltrated node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>SLN scintigraphy has been validated in patients with local biopsy or focal excision of the primary lesion only. While there remains concern that prior wide local excision can change the normal patterns of lymphatic drainage around a primary melanoma, in at least one series, prior wide local excision did not appear to adversely affect the results of lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The radiation dose associated with lymphoscintigraphy is trivial. Very small amounts of radioactivity are injected, and much of that activity is removed during surgery. When CT is added to SPECT <span class=\"nowrap\">(SPECT/CT),</span> the CT is typically not done with contrast, is only of a limited area, and is usually low-dose radiation, delivering only a fraction of the dose of diagnostic CT scans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1959723\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound is not widely utilized in staging melanoma because it relies on anatomic changes that are not seen in nodal metastases until the tumor burden is substantial. While the resolution of high-frequency ultrasound has shown promising results in superficial cervical chain nodes as well as inguinal nodes in thin patients, axillary, iliac, and other deeper node beds are not as amenable to ultrasonographic examination. In addition, sentinel node scintigraphy can identify aberrant drainage pathways to unexpected node beds and in-transit nodes.</p><p>Ultrasound relies upon the detection of anatomic changes in nodes with metastatic disease. Nodes that demonstrate the loss of the normal fatty hilum can undergo fine needle aspiration. The ultrasonographic finding of peripheral hypervascularity in combination with other ultrasonographic findings increases the sensitivity of ultrasound for the diagnosis of nodal metastasis to approximately 82 percent, with a positive predictive value of 52 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Ultrasound might prevent sentinel node biopsy procedures in patients that are destined to have a complete lymph node dissection. Although ultrasound is not generally considered a substitute for SLN biopsy, serial ultrasounds may be useful in some circumstances to detect nodal recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1959802\"><span class=\"h2\">Lungs and mediastinum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast-enhanced CT scanning is the most widely used radiographic method for evaluating intrathoracic lesions because of its increased sensitivity for detecting small pulmonary nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77904\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77904 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

When present, liver metastases are rarely solitary or isolated sites of disease. Hepatic metastases are more common in patients with choroidal or mucosal primaries, which more readily disseminate hematogenously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of uveal and conjunctival melanomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because glucose is normally stored in the liver, normal liver uptake of FDG diminishes the sensitivity of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> for detection of liver metastases. However, as with brain imaging, unless there are symptoms suggesting liver metastasis, whole-body <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is often considered adequate for staging.</p><p>If abnormalities are noted in the liver on either the PET or noncontrast CT portion of the <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scan, further workup with multiphase contrast CT or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be more accurate. The choice of CT or MRI for imaging of the liver is often based on local practice. By the time metastatic disease to the liver manifests itself on <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT,</span> through symptoms or by abnormal blood tests, there are usually multiple metastases, and multiphasic CT is adequate for localization and diagnosis. CT also has the advantage that it can be done more quickly and does not require the degree of patient cooperation that is required by MRI. If the number of hepatic metastases is important, such as in a patient that is being considered for partial hepatectomy, contrast-enhanced MRI is the most sensitive imaging study for the diagnosis of liver metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Hepatic metastases may appear partially calcified or hemorrhagic and, if large, may contain areas of necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52248\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52248 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The enhancement pattern following contrast injection may be uniform, inhomogeneous, or ring-like (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F93240\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93240 \">image 6</a>). Because liver metastases from melanoma are hypervascular, they are best evaluated by multiphase CT in the noncontrast and portal contrast phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Computed tomography arterial portography (CTAP) utilizes the predominant hepatic arterial blood supply of metastases to enhance lesion detection by increased differential tumor enhancement relative to the normal liver. The increased sensitivity of CTAP permits the detection of metastatic lesions less than 1 cm but requires catheter placement in the superior mesenteric artery and is, therefore, not practical in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Computed tomography of the hepatobiliary tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While multiphase CT is the initial procedure of choice for anatomic imaging of the liver, MRI may be useful in identifying solitary lesions, such as hemangiomas or other benign entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]. MRI is also superior for demonstrating vascular involvement and identifying additional hepatic lesions in the patient thought to have a single isolated metastasis. On MRI, metastatic lesions appear as low-signal areas on T1-weighted images and as moderately high-signal areas on T2-weighted images, while hemangiomas are characteristically well-circumscribed homogeneous lesions with low signal intensity (darker) on T1-weighted images and high intensity (brighter) on T2-weighted images.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of brain metastases in melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MRI is the preferred imaging modality when brain metastases are suspected or need to be ruled out in nonemergent cases. MRI is significantly more sensitive than CT for the detection of metastatic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91192\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91192 \">image 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] and also provides information about possible involvement of the spinal cord and leptomeninges. When MRI is not available or when it is contraindicated, CT is an alternative. On CT, intracranial metastases may enhance uniformly or in a ring-like pattern. Similar patterns are seen on gadolinium-enhanced MRI studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56550\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56550 \">image 8</a>).</p><p>Patients presenting acutely with symptoms of brain metastases can be imaged with CT as a first-line modality. CT is usually more readily available than MRI, and results may be obtained more quickly. Lesions big enough to cause symptoms are more likely to be detected on CT than smaller lesions not causing symptoms.</p><p>If a more complete evaluation of a patient with CT-positive brain metastases is needed, brain MRI may be more accurate than CT. CT brain imaging is not routinely done on all patients with stage IV melanoma, particularly asymptomatic patients; however, one study found brain lesions in as many as 12 percent of asymptomatic patients, and in the same study, brain metastases in asymptomatic patients were associated with a significantly poorer prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The impact of small asymptomatic brain metastases on the prognosis of patients receiving newer melanoma therapies has yet to be fully established.</p><p>If there is hemorrhage associated with the metastasis, MRI can not only document the presence of blood, but it can also characterize the approximate age of the hemorrhage by detecting signal changes associated with the breakdown products of hemoglobin and red blood cell membrane integrity. Even in the absence of hemorrhage, melanoma may show a brighter signal on T1 sequences due to the paramagnetic effects of melanin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1961374\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with melanoma presenting with pain that suggests a musculoskeletal origin should have a workup that is guided by the history of the symptoms and physical exam.</p><p>Localizing symptoms can guide plain film radiography, which may reveal degenerative changes, trauma, or possibly, lytic or blastic lesions, and therefore, may be sufficient for management. While inexpensive and readily available, plain films are not sensitive for early neoplastic disease; if negative, further imaging should be guided by the likelihood of metastatic disease. If the pain is localized and may be related to soft tissue injury, MRI is the procedure of choice, as it is sensitive and fairly specific for both soft tissue and bony lesions. MRI, however, usually only evaluates a limited area of interest. </p><p>If widespread metastatic disease is a concern, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> will provide accurate information about the site of interest as well as evaluate the extent of disease elsewhere in the torso [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> using either FDG or F-18 sodium fluoride is generally considered to be the most sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of occult melanoma bony metastases, although there is preliminary evidence suggesting whole-body <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/MRI</span> may be more sensitive for occult malignant bone lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. F-18 sodium fluoride <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> has shown higher accuracy for detection of bone metastases when compared with conventional bone scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>].</p><p>Most bone metastases occur in the axial skeleton. This was illustrated in a study of 50 patients with a total of 127 metastatic lesions, 80 percent of which were in the axial skeleton, including 38 percent in the ribs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. All but one of these bone metastases was lytic, and most had an expansile appearance on plain radiograph. Periosteal reaction was uncommon.</p><p>Radionuclide bone scanning is a simple and sensitive test for screening the entire skeleton for metastases, even though the majority of lesions are lytic on plain film. Activity of osteoblasts at the site of a bony metastasis can often be detected months before changes are seen on plain radiographs.</p><p>Despite its sensitivity, bone scanning is not routinely ordered in patients with melanoma unless symptoms suggesting bone metastases are present. The low specificity of this technique, combined with the low incidence of metastases to bone early in the disease, results in an unacceptable number of false-positive studies, which can be caused by benign processes such as trauma or degenerative joint disease.</p><p>CT is more specific than plain radiographs in the evaluation of bony lesions and is particularly useful for the detection of purely lytic lesions, which may not be apparent by radionuclide bone scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. MRI is the best modality for evaluating marrow signal abnormalities and accompanying features such as hemorrhage or soft tissue masses; however, MRI also suffers from a low specificity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66636\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66636 \">image 9</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1961499\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metastatic lesions involving the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are relatively common and usually multiple. Melanoma is the solid tumor that metastasizes most frequently to the small bowel. This was illustrated by one series in which 110 of 2500 patients (4.4 percent) had GI involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Of these, 35 percent had lesions affecting the small bowel. The colon, stomach, and esophagus were involved in 14, 7, and 1 percent of cases, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of metastatic melanoma&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal tract'</a>.)</p><p>Metastatic melanoma involving the GI tract may present with anemia, overt bleeding, pain, obstruction, or intussusception. Radiographic evaluation is indicated in patients with melanoma who present with any of these symptoms or unexplained weight loss. In one series, less than 10 percent of patients with metastases to the bowel presented with pain, nausea, or vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Studies that may be useful to evaluate the GI tract include abdominopelvic CT scan, small bowel follow-through, and enteroclysis. Small bowel enteroclysis is the most useful anatomic imaging procedure for evaluating small bowel lesions, while an upper GI series (UGI) is the best procedure for evaluation of symptoms referable to the esophagus and stomach. Endoscopic evaluation (fiberoptic or capsule) of bowel abnormalities detected on <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> may also be helpful.</p><p>Melanoma may cause thickening of mucosal folds or multiple, small, submucosal lesions similar to metastatic deposits from lung or breast cancer, lymphoma, and Kaposi sarcoma. Submucosal lesions may appear rounded or polypoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. If the center of the tumor ulcerates (as the tumor outgrows its blood supply), the lesion can have a bull's eye or target appearance. This manifestation is considered pathognomonic for melanoma metastases to the bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>If signs or symptoms of bowel lesions are present, the investigation should be guided by the patient presentation. If there is microscopic blood in the stool from a suspected colonic source, colonoscopy is very helpful for identifying the source. Biopsy or cautery, as needed, can be performed with colonoscopy. If there is pain or signs of obstruction, then CT or colonoscopy should be considered, depending on the presentation. Bowel obstruction caused by metastases encroaching on the bowel lumen is rare; obstruction is more commonly caused by intussusception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>While there are few published articles evaluating FDG-PET imaging of melanoma metastatic to the bowel, one report suggests that FDG-PET can detect bowel metastases that are missed by conventional anatomic imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. FDG can be normally seen in the small bowel and colon, particularly in patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>. This normal tracer uptake can decrease the accuracy of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> for the detection of bowel lesions since normal bowel uptake of FDG may be seen in some patients. Bowel metastases may also be discovered incidentally during FDG <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging for staging or monitoring response to therapy. Focal intense tracer uptake in the bowel with no adjacent segmental bowel uptake should raise suspicion for bowel metastasis. In this situation, colonoscopy for large bowel abnormalities or capsule endoscopy may be indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1961645\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin and subcutaneous tissue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involvement of skin or subcutaneous tissue may be the first sign of metastatic disease. In one report, 17 of 45 patients (38 percent) with CT evidence of metastatic melanoma had subcutaneous nodules shown on CT; in five (11 percent), they were the only site of metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. These lesions are particularly conspicuous on CT scans because of the density of the metastatic nodules relative to the low attenuation of the surrounding subcutaneous fat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53362\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53362 \">image 10</a>).</p><p>However, imaging findings are rarely the first indicator of subcutaneous metastases, which can often be easily felt by the patient and clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1961705\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, melanoma metastases may invade muscle. On CT scanning, these metastases are hypervascular, and therefore, they typically have high attenuation relative to muscle following contrast injection. They may also present as low-attenuation lesions on CT imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53160\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53160 \">image 11</a>). <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is more sensitive than CT for the diagnosis of muscle metastasis, but in one series, the false-positive rate was high for isolated findings. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> was more accurate when multiple focal abnormalities were detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1961765\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Melanomas are more likely to metastasize to the heart than other solid tumors. Although most secondary pericardial tumors do not invade the myocardium, myocardial involvement is a classic feature of melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Both techniques, which are usually performed for some other reason, are superior to echocardiography for determining whether an effusion is a transudate, exudate, or blood.</p><p>Large tumor masses in the pericardium can be recognized by most of the previously discussed imaging studies. In some cases, however, a hematoma, usually of traumatic origin, can be mistaken for neoplasia. Echocardiography, particularly transesophageal echocardiography complemented by ultrafast CT scanning and MRI imaging, can provide the degree of structural resolution necessary to ascertain the extent of local structural involvement. As with the brain, the use of PET for imaging metastases to the myocardium is not practical because of the normal myocardial concentration of glucose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1962850\"><span class=\"h2\">Other sites of metastatic involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other less common sites of metastasis include the spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, gallbladder, and breast.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typical CT appearance of splenic metastases consists of single or multiple ill-defined, low-attenuation lesions, but they may also occasionally appear as well-defined cystic masses or target lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melanoma metastases to the kidney may similarly be single or multiple, and solid or cystic. It is unusual for renal metastases to calcify, and this finding should raise suspicion for another etiology, such as a primary renal cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Although melanoma uncommonly presents as a perirenal mass, it was the most frequent cause of such masses in one large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Ultrasound may be useful to further characterize a renal mass as cystic or solid (more likely to be malignant) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62586\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62586 \">image 12</a>). Because FDG is normally excreted through the kidneys, FDG <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is insensitive for metastases to the kidneys or elsewhere in the urinary tract.

In older autopsy series, adrenal metastases were often large and frequently bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Similar to their appearance at other metastatic sites, lesions may be solid or cystic. A retrospective review of 1180 melanoma patients with distant metastasis showed that 13 percent had adrenal metastases with a median survival of six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melanoma metastases to the gallbladder are rare (1 to 2 percent of cases at autopsy), but they represent the most common hematogenously spread metastasis to this organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Gallbladder metastases are usually accompanied by liver metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-studies-in-melanoma/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Metastatic lesions in the gallbladder appear as mucosal deposits that become polypoid as they grow.
