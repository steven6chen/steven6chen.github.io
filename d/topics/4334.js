However, with accurate advice and treatment, most of these difficulties can be overcome, and breastfeeding can be successfully sustained for longer periods.</p><p>Common problems associated with breastfeeding and their management are reviewed here. The initiation of breastfeeding and immediate postpartum evaluation of mothers and infants are discussed separately.

While these mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed, the intake of their infants should be monitored closely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Following breast augmentation, lactation insufficiency is common, especially in women in whom there was a periareolar incision <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of nipple sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Breast reduction procedures using a pedicle technique have not been shown to significantly impair lactation. Breastfeeding is typically not feasible in women undergoing breast reduction using the free nipple technique, in which the nipple was completely removed during the surgery, since the ducts are completely disrupted and unlikely to recanalize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Regardless of the type of breast reduction procedure, all mothers who have undergone breast reduction should be monitored closely because they are at risk for insufficient breast milk production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reduction#H287805328\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reduction&quot;, section on 'Impact on future breastfeeding'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A delay in the usual progression of lactogenesis to stage II. This delay interferes with the anticipated increase in milk production that normally occurs within the first five days of life. The most common reasons for such a delay include maternal prepregnancy obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], pregnancy-induced hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], polycystic ovary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and other complications associated with high androgen levels during pregnancy (eg, pre-eclampsia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other less common causes are retained placental fragments and pituitary insufficiency, also known as Sheehan syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-lactation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of lactation&quot;, section on 'Lactogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some maternal medications interfere with the establishment of a milk supply. These include oxytocin and possibly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other medications decrease the existing milk supply. These include dopamine agonists (for example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a>), decongestants, and estrogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Because estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are known to reduce milk volume, most guidelines advise avoiding their use by breastfeeding women during the first 30 days postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This effect is dose-related so low-dose estrogen products such as estradiol 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/day</span> are unlikely to appreciably diminish milk supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. A World Health Organization guideline is more restrictive and suggests that they generally should not be used through six months postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Other contraceptive methods are available that have less effect on lactation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods#H626594215\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;, section on 'Impact on lactation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459077870\"><span class=\"h3\">Poor milk extraction</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor feeding routines in the early postpartum period are the most common cause of insufficient milk intake. They include infrequent feeding, inadequate latch-on (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112380\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112380 \">figure 1</a>), maternal-infant separation, and the use of supplemental formula. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many babies are sleepy and difficult to keep awake during the first several days after birth, causing insufficient milk transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Less commonly, oral-motor or neurologic abnormalities may lead to insufficient emptying and milk transfer. Late preterm infants (gestational age between 34 and 37 weeks) often have feeding difficulties compared with term infants. As a result, they need close monitoring to establish successful breastfeeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breastfeeding the preterm infant&quot;, section on 'Late preterm infants'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient nursing may often result in inadequate milk production, since frequent and complete breast emptying is necessary for adequate breast milk volume. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1382914774\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of inadequate intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of inadequate milk intake is made clinically by demonstrating insufficient feeding based on a nursing history, decreased infant urine and stool output, and excess weight loss of the infant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-breastfeeding#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Assessment of intake'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the first week of life, mothers with term infants generally nurse 8 to 12 times in 24 hours, and by four weeks after delivery, nursing usually decreases to seven to nine times per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By the fifth day of life, infants with adequate intake urinate six to eight times daily and have three or more pale yellow and seedy stools daily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of normal breastfeeding frequency, voids, and stools cannot guarantee sufficient weight gain. Infants must be weighed to determine adequate calorie intake during each of their routine health assessment visits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Term infants generally lose weight in the first three to five days of life with an average loss of 7 percent of their birth weight. They typically will regain their birth weight by one to two weeks of life. Once the mother's breasts feel full with milk by day three to five, the infant should not continue to lose weight. If an infant has lost 10 percent of its weight or fails to regain birthweight appropriately, inadequate intake should be considered and direct observation of breastfeeding should be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breastfeeding the preterm infant&quot;, section on 'Test weighing'</a> and <a href=\"#H115298935\" class=\"local\">'Observed feeding'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115298551\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of management is to increase milk production and milk transfer. Initial management is focused on determining and addressing the cause of inadequate milk supply or transfer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough breastfeeding history may identify contributing maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neonatal factors. These include previous maternal breast surgeries, oral candidal infection of the infant, and the maternal use of drugs that reduce milk production.

Use of breast pumps or manual hand expression especially after a feeding increases stimulation and emptying of the breast, thereby enhancing milk production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-breastfeeding#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Mechanics of feeding'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115298558\"><span class=\"h3\">Galactagogues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Galactagogues (or lactagogues) are medications or other substances believed to augment maternal milk production. The most commonly used prescription agents are dopamine receptor antagonists, primarily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a>. We do <strong>not</strong> recommend the routine use of galactagogues because there is limited evidence to support their efficacy, and because of potential safety concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These agents should never be used in place of an evaluation and correction of any modifiable factors such as frequency and thoroughness of breast emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. If galactagogues are considered in selected patients who have not responded to lactation support, they should be used with caution, and mothers need to be aware of potential side effects and the lack of data supporting their use.</p><p>Most studies suggest limited efficacy of galactagogues in increasing milk production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-25</a>]. In small randomized trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> given to mothers of term or preterm infants at a dose of 10 mg every eight hours, there was no difference in the amount of milk production between mothers who received metoclopramide compared with mothers who received placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/19,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24,25</a>]. A systematic review concluded that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a> may increase the volume of expressed breast milk in mothers pumping for their preterm infants, but the findings may not be generalizable because the two included studies involved mothers greater than 14 days postpartum and who had full lactation support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. In another trial of 80 mothers who were expressing breast milk to feed their infants in the neonatal intensive care unit, 10-day courses of domperidone and metoclopramide appeared to be equally effective in increasing milk production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Although 15 percent of mothers reported side effects (eg, headaches, diarrhea, and mood swings), this may be an underestimation, as a significant number of mothers withdrew from the trial (n = 15). Another trial in mothers of preterm infants under 29 weeks gestation found that domperidone appeared to increase milk volume, at least in some of the subjects, although the absolute increase in milk volume was modest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a> is also limited by concerns about possible adverse effects. Although no definite adverse effects of metoclopramide on the infant have been demonstrated, there are theoretical concerns about the use of this drug during lactation because of its known effects on the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Domperidone is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk, and does not cross the blood-brain barrier. However, because of important concerns about arrhythmias due to QT prolongation, domperidone is not approved for marketing in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Moreover, the quality of product available from compounding pharmacies cannot be assured. In addition, the long-term effects of these medications on offspring are unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/16,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,33</a>]. Domperidone use is most risky in mothers who are at risk for prolonged QT syndrome, on other medications that increase the QT interval, on CYP3A4 inhibitors such as grapefruit juice or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>, or take domperidone doses over 30 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Data on the use of herbal galactagogues are even more limited. Fenugreek is the most widely used herbal agent, but data are insufficient to determine its efficacy and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Reported side effects include diarrhea, flatulence, allergic reactions, and hypokalemia. In addition, it is not known whether components of the herb are transferred to the infant via breast milk.

Pain due to nipple injury needs to be distinguished from nipple sensitivity, which normally increases during pregnancy and peaks approximately on the fourth postpartum day. Normal nipple sensitivity can be differentiated from the pain due to nipple trauma, the most common cause of nipple pain, by differences in their timing and course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal sensitivity typically subsides approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute after suckling begins.

This &quot;latch-on pain&quot; should not persist throughout the whole feeding and should resolve completely after the first week or two. In addition, some mothers find the &quot;pins and needles&quot; sensation of let-down to be uncomfortable, but this discomfort also resolves in the first weeks of breastfeeding.

Natal teeth can rarely present at birth. In these neonates, the incisal edge may need to be smoothed to decrease maternal discomfort, or if they are causing great discomfort or pain they may need to be removed.

Infants usually bite more at the end of the feeding since their tongues cover the teeth during active feeding. Biting is often avoided by keeping the baby close to the breast while feeding with the mouth wide open, which prevents the baby's latch from becoming shallow onto the nipple. Once swallowing is over and the baby is nursing for comfort, taking the baby off the breast prevents biting. If these steps are not helpful, and the baby continues to bite, the mother should say &quot;no&quot; firmly, break the suction with her finger, and put the infant on a safe surface. Mothers should avoid expressing too much emotion over the event to discourage the infant from repeating it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Mothers should use careful hand hygiene and cover any lesions with which the infant might come into contact. Mothers can pump and the expressed milk that does not come into direct contact with open herpetic lesions can be given to the infant.

Hand expression is accomplished by placing the thumb and forefingers well behind the areola toward the chest wall and then compressing them together and toward the nipple in a rhythmic fashion. Using the fingers in a similar position, the mother can present the nipple in a way that is easier to latch. Mothers can also use this rhythmic compression while the infant is suckling to enhance milk transfer (<a href=\"http://newborns.stanford.edu/Breastfeeding/HandExpression.html&amp;token=4y/yzfFKD3K4ZvO1oMgy96lFdeqy5MbwgANHpxqlwT2Zjs1rpFod3uK3GdB6V9K5T35o6AvWqyc5+z/W1luh8oXlLEFkfxatpNJo2LiVxNY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4996\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Stanford video link on Hand expression of breast milk</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some mothers may find use of a breast pump to be helpful.

Milk overproduction occurs early in lactation, and more often in primigravidas, although it may worsen in affected mothers with successive pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>In some cases, the rush of the milk with the mother's ejection reflex may be too forceful, and the infant may have trouble feeding. Infants may choke and cough and become irritable with feeding, and may bite to clamp the nipple. Infants may either have an increased weight gain, or paradoxically, poor weight because of inadequate intake as they cannot handle the flow of milk, or because the infant is not receiving hind milk with its higher caloric content. Overproduction of milk typically resolves over the first few weeks of lactation. </p><p>Mothers with milk oversupply should be evaluated for drugs that increase milk production (eg, psychiatric medications that may be dopamine antagonists or herbs like fenugreek). If the problem persists, the mother should also be evaluated for hypo- or hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9183621\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of milk oversupply <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an overactive milk ejection reflex is based on clinical experience and consists of the following (<a href=\"http://www.llli.org/faq/oversupply.html&amp;token=HEX1pzl9thi/Gx59XftfdW0s+qwdltGlAmoNiOIHNc8bay6P0Pw5CQ5ALc9J7WN0&amp;TOPIC_ID=4996\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">La Leche League website: Oversupply</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nursing position &ndash; Mothers should nurse with the infant in a more upright position and the mother leaning back or in the side lying position; this allows the infant to better control the flow of milk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manual reduction of flow &ndash; Using a scissors-hold on the areola or pressing on the breast with the heel of the hand may restrict flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeding strategies &ndash; Infants should be allowed to interrupt feeding as needed, and often need frequent burping.

This decision is influenced by factors including subsequent pregnancies, career choices, and maternal health. Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for the first six months of life. Around six months of age, iron-rich complementary foods should generally be offered to infants. The AAP recommends breastfeeding be continued for at least one year and longer as desired by the mother or child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

When abrupt weaning occurs because of unanticipated maternal-child separation or severe maternal illness, engorgement is likely and steps should be taken to diminish it. The mother may experience &quot;milk fever&quot; (a condition of a flu-like illness with fever chills and malaise). This is thought to be caused by maternal reabsorption of milk products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Rapid weaning results in a rapid decrease in prolactin, and this may cause an increase in depressive symptoms.

After the child starts solid foods, the child will diminish breastfeeding, and gradually the weaning process begins. If the weaning is gradual, engorgement is not likely to occur.</p><p>Strategies for weaning include dropping a breastfeeding session every two to five days, shortening each breastfeeding session, and increasing the time between breastfeeding sessions. Midday feedings are often ideal to eliminate first since the child is often active at this time and so may not become fussy. Persons other than the mother may have more success offering other feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. During the weaning process, it is important that the mother continue to maintain closeness.</p><p>It may be challenging for exclusively breastfed infants to accommodate to bottle feeding. Older infants may be directly weaned to a cup. For infants being weaned to a bottle, varying the type of nipple may be helpful in those who are having difficulty adjusting to bottle feeding.</p><p>If engorgement occurs during the weaning process, mothers should try to avoid pumping any more than is necessary to relieve engorgement as this will increase milk supply.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2887438607\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
