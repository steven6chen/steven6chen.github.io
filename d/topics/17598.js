The disorder is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, including recurrent infections, chronic lung disease, gastrointestinal disease, and autoimmune disorders.</p><p>The cornerstone of therapy is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement, which has dramatically altered the clinical course of CVID by reducing the burden of recurrent infections and subsequent complications. Management also involves vigilant monitoring for associated problems, such as pulmonary damage, gastrointestinal, autoimmune, and granulomatous diseases, and malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The treatment and health maintenance of patients with CVID will be discussed here, with an emphasis on adults. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of this disorder and issues particularly relevant to pediatric patients are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common variable immunodeficiency in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of common variable immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNE GLOBULIN REPLACEMENT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of CVID includes individuals with varying degrees of loss of antibody. For those with substantial impairments in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> production (eg, generally two standard deviations below the normal range for immunoglobulin G [IgG]) and nonresponse to both protein and polysaccharide vaccines, immune globulin replacement is necessary. For subjects with higher levels of serum IgG and only minor impairments in response to some vaccines, immune globulin replacement therapy may be postponed, but these patients should be followed closely. (See <a href=\"#H4474903\" class=\"local\">'Patients without infections or with isolated autoimmune disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633840199\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Immune globulin</a> replacement therapy may be administered either intravenously or subcutaneously. A typical approach is to begin therapy with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), although one can also start with subcutaneous immune globulin (SCIG), with an initial loading regimen. If the intravenous route is used to initiate therapy, the subcutaneous route may be substituted after two or more months on IVIG, if this is preferred. We occasionally start patients with very poor venous access on SCIG from the outset. A more detailed discussion of the characteristics and safety of various preparations of IVIG, how to initiate therapy with IVIG or SCIG, and how to convert from IVIG to SCIG, is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune globulin therapy in primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous and intramuscular immune globulin therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2572619888\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravenous route</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IVIG therapy can be administered in the office, infusion center, or home. Selected patients may also be candidates for self-infusion of IVIG. The placement of indwelling catheters solely for the administration of IVIG is not recommended due to the propensity of CVID patients to develop infectious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1378053857\"><span class=\"h4\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual initial dosing for IVIG in patients with CVID is 300 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every three to four weeks with or without premedication. Patients who are actively infected at the time of the initial infusion are more likely to experience adverse symptoms during infusion, so when possible, we try to treat the infection first, then initiate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>. Premedication with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> is commonly used for those who are prone to medication reactions, and in some cases, a glucocorticoid (such as IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>) is also given. One may also repeat the initial dose (ie, the entire 300 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> in a few days or one week later if the patient was clearing an infection when the initial dose was given. Generally, after the first two or three infusions, premedication is no longer needed. Premedications are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy#H164158\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy&quot;, section on 'Premedications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H925230691\"><span class=\"h4\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The half-life of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> is approximately 30 days, although variability among individuals exists. Steady-state levels are usually achieved after three to six months of therapy, and we measure trough levels of IgG beginning six months after the first dose and every six months thereafter. The level of IgG in the blood on therapy should be at least near the middle of the normal range, and the patient should experience a significant decrease in major infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Dosing may need to be adjusted periodically, as patient weight and endogenous production or clearance may change over time. Additional monitoring issues are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>We usually increase the dose in 5 to 10 gram increments, starting after the first six months of therapy, if higher doses are needed. Another way to increase the effective dose is to shorten the dosing interval from every four to every three weeks, which increases the monthly dose by 33 percent. To monitor the need for higher doses, reduced infections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> need for antibiotics should be observed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2204515846\"><span class=\"h3\">Subcutaneous route</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative to IVIG for maintenance therapy is SCIG. This is usually administered weekly or every other week, depending on body weight and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> requirements. There is also a subcutaneous preparation that is facilitated by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronidase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronidase</a>, which allows for infusion of larger doses and thus can be administered every three to four weeks. This is discussed elsewhere.

SCIG can be self-infused at home, which is more convenient for many patients and can improve quality of life. Initial dosing of SCIG and conversion of patients from IVIG to SCIG are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous and intramuscular immune globulin therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Immune globulin</a> replacement therapy reduces the number of infections and decreases antibiotic use and hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The effectiveness of immune globulin replacement in hypogammaglobulinemic patients was immediately apparent after this therapy became available, and so randomized, controlled trials were never undertaken. In one retrospective series of 50 patients treated with IVIG, the annual incidence of pneumonia decreased from 81 percent before treatment to 35 percent on therapy, and the rate of hospitalization decreased from 89 to 46 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a large series of 2212 patients with CVID enrolled in a European primary immunodeficiency registry, patients receiving IVIG at doses yielding higher serum levels had fewer serious infections and days of hospitalization for primary immunodeficiency, compared with those with lower serum levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, treatment with immune globulin does not entirely eliminate infections in most patients, and the sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal systems, in particular, remain susceptible. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Sinusitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal infections'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Progression of chronic lung disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Immune globulin</a> replacement may slow the progression of chronic lung disease in patients with CVID, although this has not been conclusively established. A prospective study of 24 patients receiving standard dose IVIG found a significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scores in patients with chronic pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, another study documented progressive lung changes by HRCT of 21 in 22 patients followed over three years, despite maintenance of trough IgG levels of 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> although some experts argue that this trough value was not sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Chronic lung disease is one of the indications for higher <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> doses, which may provide additional benefit for some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/4,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14,15</a>]. One study showed radiographic improvement of chronic lung disease in 4 of 12 CVID patients receiving a dose of 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> compared with no radiographic improvement in any patient receiving a dose of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. In addition, all six patients switched to higher dose IVIG in this study showed improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV<sub>1</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There are no studies directly comparing 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (or other doses) with 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in order to determine the optimal dose in such patients. Until more data are available, it is our practice to initiate immune globulin replacement therapy at a higher dose of 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in patients who have evidence of chronic lung disease at diagnosis. The goal trough level is the same as that for standard dosing.

Immune globulin replacement therapy may exert a protective effect in those with autoimmune disease, although it is not known to alter the development of malignancy or to impact granulomatous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4474903\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients without infections or with isolated autoimmune disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About 8 to 10 percent of patients with laboratory confirmed CVID have little or no significant medical history of infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

It is our experience that CVID patients typically do not clear common infections without the use of antibiotics. As examples, acute sinusitis or bronchitis is unlikely to clear spontaneously in patients with CVID, unlike in the general population, even in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy. Thus, prompt identification and treatment with antibiotics can help prevent chronic infections and infectious complications. It is also important to ensure that the infection has cleared completely at the end of a course of antibiotics, as patients with immunodeficiency sometimes require longer durations of therapy.</p><p>Antibiotic resistance does not seem to be a prominent problem in patients with CVID, for reasons which are not clear. One study found that the lungs of patients with primary antibody deficiency were persistently colonized with <em>H. influenzae</em> (identified in approximately two-thirds of patients) and that the isolates remained sensitive to commonly used antibiotics; resistant strains were not found despite repeated treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Management of sinusitis in patients with CVID is similar to that in patients without immunodeficiency, although the treatment duration may need to be longer. If a patient's past sinusitis episodes did not clear with the standard 10 days or two weeks of antibiotics, it is reasonable to prescribe three weeks as initial treatment for future episodes. Recommendations for antibiotics for acute bacterial sinusitis are found separately.

Chronic sinusitis may persist despite <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy, possibly because of the multifactorial nature of this condition (ie, chronic infection is just one factor in pathogenesis).

This therapy might be considered in the treatment of refractory infections in subjects with CVID who have demonstrated defects in T cell function.</p><p>Allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) has been performed in a small number of patients with CVID, either for the treatment of hematologic malignancies or for severe manifestations of CVID that were not responding to other interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. In a review of 25 patients, overall survival was 48 percent, with graft-versus-host disease the leading cause of death. Among those who survived, one-half were able to discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, and the condition prompting ASCT resolved in 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Thus, ASCT could be considered in individuals with malignancies or severe disease refractory to other options after a careful risk:benefit analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of death associated with acute bacterial infection in CVID decreased dramatically with the advent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> treatment. Thereafter, the major causes of death have been complications of chronic lung disease and malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/16,17,46,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,46,59,60</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest series of 473 patients reported long-term data for 411 individuals, followed over a period of 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. During this time, 19.6 percent died, with a median age at death of 44 and 42 for females and males, respectively. The leading causes of death were respiratory failure due to chronic lung disease (36 percent), lymphoid and other malignancies (29 percent), and liver disease (9 percent). Reduced survival was seen in patients with gastrointestinal disease, chronic lung disease, hepatic disease, and lymphoma, although not in those with other complications, such as autoimmune disorders, granuloma, or bronchiectasis without other lung disease. Long-term survival was excellent in patients with only infectious complications, but significantly lower in those with one or more noninfectious complications (95 versus 42 percent at 40 years, respectively). Immunologic parameters associated with higher mortality were lower levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), increased serum immunoglobulin M (IgM), and lower percentages of circulating B cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another center reported on the 353 patients diagnosed as adults also followed over a 40-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Mortality in this group was very similar at 19.5 percent, with a median age at death of 54 and 53 from females and males, respectively. The leading cause of death was chronic lung disease (30 percent). A similar percentage of patients succumbed to lymphoma, while a higher percentage died from other types of malignancies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third series of 334 patients, mortality was highest in patients with bronchiectasis, enteropathy, polyclonal lymphocytic infiltration, and autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In this series, there were no associations between survival and gender or initial serum IgG, immunoglobulin A (IgA), or IgM levels.</p><p/><p>Subsequent research has demonstrated that the percentage of circulating class-switched memory B cells can be useful in predicting a patient's risk for the development of certain complications of CVID, such as lymphoid hyperplasia, granulomatous disease, or autoimmune disorders.

The usual initial dosing for intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is 300 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> given every three to four weeks, with the goal of maintaining a trough immunoglobulin G (IgG) level in the middle of the normal range and reducing the incidence of significant infections. Some patients require more immune globulin than others to attain these goals. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Immune globulin replacement therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy for CVID patients with persistent infections (eg, sinusitis), chronic pulmonary disease, or autoimmune hematologic disorders (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2674140972\" class=\"local\">'Indications for higher dosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may prefer subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (SCIG) therapy, as this can be self-administered at home and is more convenient for many. Subcutaneous administration is medically indicated for patients with reactions to IVIG, those with rapid immune globulin loss, and those with poor intravenous access. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous and intramuscular immune globulin therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Immune globulin</a> replacement therapy reduces the frequency of most types of infections in patients with CVID. It may also slow the progression of chronic lung disease and offer some protection against autoimmune disorders. However, there is little evidence that immune globulin therapy protects against the development of malignancy or granulomatous disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Impact of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CVID do not usually clear common infections without antibiotics, and antibiotic therapy should be instituted early for common infections, such as bronchitis and acute sinusitis. In addition, longer courses of therapy are sometimes required to eradicate infections completely. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of specific infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections in CVID patients with ongoing pulmonary infections despite <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy and in those requiring chronic glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We do not routinely give prophylactic antibiotics to all CVID patients, and the utility of this intervention has not been adequately studied. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management#H3942620081\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary immunodeficiency: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with CVID who plan to travel receive the appropriate inactivated vaccinations (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Live vaccinations should be avoided. Some patients may only mount a partial response. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Vaccinations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CVID may develop autoimmune, inflammatory, and granulomatous disorders requiring immunosuppressive therapies. Patients should be carefully monitored for the specific complications associated with the agent in question and appear to experience higher rates of infectious adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Therapy for noninfectious disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CVID should undergo all age-appropriate cancer screening and additionally be monitored for signs and symptoms of lymphoma. These include constitutional symptoms, solitary nodules, expanding lymph nodes, other masses, and focal pulmonary findings that fail to resolve with treatment.
