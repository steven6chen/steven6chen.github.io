Adequacy of pulmonary blood flow and CO is dependent on preload and the transpulmonary gradient (TPG), which is the pressure difference between the CVP and the common atrial pressure. Typically, the CVP is maintained at 10 to 15 mmHg for an ideal TPG at 5 to 10 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-congenital-heart-disease-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1686336518\" class=\"local\">'Fluid management'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with failing Fontan physiology have declining ability to maintain adequate CO despite chronically elevated CVP. This may be due to systolic or diastolic dysfunction of the single ventricle (see <a href=\"#H1523021936\" class=\"local\">'Presence of ventricular dysfunction'</a> below), atrioventricular valve regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-congenital-heart-disease-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. These patients have a low CO state and chronically elevated CVP, with resultant liver and lymphatic sequelae (elevated transaminases, cirrhosis, protein losing enteropathy). Eventually, elevated ventricular end-diastolic pressure results in elevated common atrial pressure, necessitating an even higher CVP to drive blood through the pulmonary system to maintain CO.

The most severe example is Eisenmenger syndrome, in which a significant left-to-right shunt eventually leads to irreversible severe PAH, with reversal of shunt direction to right-to-left, with resultant chronic cyanosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults-with-congenital-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary hypertension in adults with congenital heart disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Eisenmenger syndrome&quot;, section on 'Noncardiac surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Strategies to decrease PVR include chronically administered medications that should be continued up to and during the surgical procedure (see <a href=\"#H1563813\" class=\"local\">'Chronically administered medications'</a> below). During the perioperative period, administration of high FiO<sub>2</sub> and hyperventilation to produce mild hypocarbia (ie, partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PaCO<sub>2</sub>] 30 to 35 mmHg) may further decrease PVR. Sympathetic stimulation is avoided by ensuring a smooth anesthetic induction and emergence without coughing or straining, and by maintaining excellent analgesia throughout the perioperative period. In selected patients, administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitric oxide</a> (eg, 20 ppm) may be necessary to further decrease PVR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhaled nitric oxide in adults: Biology and indications for use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with RV hypertrophy due to severe PAH require adequate RV preload to maintain CO. Hypovolemia is avoided or immediately treated, whether absolute (eg, due to blood loss) or relative (eg, due to vasodilation). CVP measurements, if available, are maintained at the patient's baseline, which varies depending on the cardiac lesion. In hypovolemic patients, increases in intravascular volume <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CVP are best accomplished gradually to avoid precipitating RV failure (eg, with administration of <span class=\"nowrap\">5-mL/kg</span> increments of isotonic crystalloid).

Maintenance of the atrial kick is also very important. Sinus rhythm and a normal HR are optimal; a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (SVT) can result in marked hypotension necessitating immediate cardioversion (see <a href=\"#H591300394\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of arrhythmias'</a> below). SVR must be maintained, with vasoactive agents if necessary (see <a href=\"#H1435980753\" class=\"local\">'Vasoactive drugs'</a> below). Hypotension is avoided because the resulting reduction in coronary perfusion can lead to subendocardial ischemia of the hypertrophied ventricle and ventricular arrhythmias.

If decreased CO results in hypoperfusion, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milrinone</a> is often selected because of its inotropic, lusitropic (ie, myocardium-relaxant), and vasodilatory properties in both the systemic and pulmonary circulations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F96387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96387 \">table 2</a>).
