Instead, treatment of bronchiectasis is aimed at controlling infection, reducing inflammation, and improving bronchial hygiene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Surgical extirpation of affected areas may be useful in selected patients. </p><p>The treatment of bronchiectasis will be reviewed here.

However, some disease processes can be controlled to prevent further scarring.

Treatment with antibiotics reduces the bacterial load and airway and systemic inflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Deciding when a patient has an acute exacerbation depends upon symptomatic changes rather than any specific laboratory feature. Acute bacterial infections are usually heralded by increased production of sputum that is more viscous with darker color, and may be accompanied by lassitude, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, or hemoptysis. Systemic complaints such as fever and chills are generally absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Sputum is obtained for Gram stain and culture prior to antibiotic administration. A chest radiograph is performed in patients with respiratory distress or systemic complaints to exclude the possibility of pneumothorax or pneumonia. Sputum elastase is an emerging biomarker candidate that may herald an exacerbation and correlate with antibiotic responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Viral infection may also be a contributor to exacerbations of bronchiectasis. In a one-year study of 119 patients with bronchiectasis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays identified respiratory viral sequences (coronavirus, rhinovirus, and influenza) in nasopharyngeal and sputum samples more frequently during exacerbations as compared with steady state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, inflammatory markers were more often associated with the virus positive than virus negative states. The role of viruses is not yet clear as there were no clinical correlates. </p><p>The colonizing bacterial flora in patients with bronchiectasis is slightly different from that seen with chronic bronchitis. Frequently isolated pathogens in bronchiectasis include <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> (especially mucoid types), and, less frequently, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The likelihood of resistant organisms tends to increase with the number of prior courses of antibiotics. The presence of <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, particularly if the patient has had prior courses of anti-pseudomonal agents, often necessitates administration of intravenous antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173942673\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral antibiotic treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most afebrile, clinically stable patients with an exacerbation of bronchiectasis can be treated with an oral antibiotic. The initial selection of an oral antibiotic for an exacerbation of bronchiectasis is generally based on previous sputum bacteriology results, the history of success or failure of prior regimens, and the presence of allergy to antimicrobial agents.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sputum culture data not available</strong> &ndash; For those without culture information, a fluoroquinolone (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a>) is a reasonable, broad spectrum, therapeutic option. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sputum growing sensitive organisms</strong> &ndash; For patients whose sputum cultures do not show beta-lactamase-positive <em>H. influenzae</em> or <em>Pseudomonas</em>, reasonable initial antibiotic choices include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, 500 mg three times daily, or a macrolide, based on the typical colonization patterns noted above. Alternatively, other antibiotics with a similar spectrum of coverage may be used. The initial antibiotic selection can be modified based on the response to therapy and results of the sputum culture and sensitivity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sputum culture growing beta-lactamase-positive organism</strong> &ndash; In the presence of beta-lactamase producing <em>H. influenzae</em>, antibiotic choices include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a>, a second or third generation cephalosporin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, or a fluoroquinolone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

For patients with known airway infection with <em>Pseudomonas</em>, the initial antibiotic selection depends on the sensitivity patterns of the organisms isolated. In the absence of known resistance to quinolones, the usual choice is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, 500 to 750 mg twice daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because of the propensity of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> to develop resistance and the limited availability of oral agents, the efficacy of adding inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> solution (TS) to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> was studied. In a multicenter trial, 53 patients with known <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection who were having exacerbations of bronchiectasis were randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin plus inhaled TS or ciprofloxacin plus placebo for two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The addition of inhaled TS to ciprofloxacin did not improve clinical outcomes compared to ciprofloxacin alone, although there was a marked reduction of <em>Pseudomonas</em> density in the sputum of patients who received inhaled TS plus ciprofloxacin. Wheezing was more common in the inhaled TS plus ciprofloxacin group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Based on current data, inhaled aerosols of antibiotics, such as TS, cannot be recommended alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> for acute exacerbations in bronchiectasis. Certain aerosolized antibiotics may be helpful for prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H173942037\" class=\"local\">'Inhaled antibiotics'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duration of therapy</strong> &ndash; The optimal duration of therapy is not well-defined. Clinical experience favors a duration of 10 to 14 days for patients with a first time or few exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines released in 2017 suggest a 14-day course of antibiotics based on expert consensus, although they note that shorter and longer durations have not been directly compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Sputum culture and sensitivity to help define antibiotic selection are indicated in patients who fail to respond to the initial antibiotic, or who have repeated symptomatic attacks over a short period of time. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173942654\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sputum growing resistant </strong><strong><em>Pseudomonas</em></strong><strong> </strong>&ndash; The nonquinolone antibiotics typically used for resistant <em>Pseudomonas</em> require intravenous administration. Intravenous antibiotics for exacerbations due to resistant Pseudomonas are discussed below and separately.

As with outpatient treatment, a sputum sample is obtained for bacteriologic culture prior to initiation of antibiotics. Blood cultures are obtained in patients with a fever &ge;38&#730;C or evidence of respiratory distress. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the reason for hospital admission is to initiate intravenous antibiotics because the patient has known airway infection with <em>Pseudomonas</em> resistant to oral quinolones (rather than due to severity of illness), the initial antibiotic choice is based on the sensitivity profile from culture data and history of allergy to antibiotics. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If sputum culture data are not available, local antibiotic resistance patterns and responses to recent antibiotics guide empiric antibiotic selection. For example, if the patient has failed an oral quinolone, coverage for resistant <em>Pseudomonas</em> and methicillin resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> should be included, pending updated culture results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is controversial whether single or dual (eg, beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside) antibiotic therapy is preferable for flares of bronchiectasis due to <em>Pseudomonas</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A meta-analysis of studies examining this question in patients with cystic fibrosis was unable to determine which course of therapy is better [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We typically use a single agent (eg, antipseudomonal penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a>) unless the patient appears acutely ill such that an incipient <em>Pseudomonas</em> pneumonia seems possible. In the latter case, we typically add a second agent (eg, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside). Aminoglycosides should not be used as monotherapy. The question of single versus dual therapy and antibiotic selection and dosing for <em>Pseudomonas</em> pneumonia are discussed in greater detail separately.

There was evidence of pulmonary hypertension (defined as an estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure &gt;40 mmHg) in 33 percent of patients and right ventricular systolic dysfunction in 13 percent. Both abnormalities were more common among patients with cystic bronchiectasis. Right ventricular dysfunction correlated with a low forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), low diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), hypercarbia, and hypoxemia.

Exacerbations are usually caused by acute bacterial infections. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of acute exacerbations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most causes of bronchiectasis, treatment of the underlying disease is not possible. Examples of disease processes in which specific therapies may interrupt progression of bronchiectasis include nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, certain immunodeficiencies, cystic fibrosis (in presence of G551D mutation), recurrent aspiration, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, tracheobronchomegaly, and possibly bronchiectasis associated with rheumatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H173941533\" class=\"local\">'Treating the underlying disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial antibiotic regimen for acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis is tailored to prior sputum cultures and sensitivities, rather than chosen empirically. Additional factors in antibiotic selection include oral versus parenteral administration, the history of success or failure of prior regimens, and the presence of allergy to antimicrobial agents. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of acute exacerbations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For outpatients with sputum cultures that do not show beta-lactamase-positive <em>H. influenzae</em> or <em>Pseudomonas</em>, reasonable initial antibiotic choices include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, 500 mg three times daily, or a macrolide. In the presence of beta-lactamase producing organisms, choices include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a>, second or third generation cephalosporin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, or a fluoroquinolone. (See <a href=\"#H173942673\" class=\"local\">'Oral antibiotic treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For outpatients with multiple prior exacerbations or no recent sputum culture data, we suggest initiation of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a>), rather than an alternative oral antibiotic.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of acute exacerbations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For hospitalized patients with an acute exacerbation, we suggest initiation of an intravenous antibiotic with efficacy for <em>P. aeruginosa</em> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Alternatively, for patients who are acutely ill and have a history of growing resistant strains of <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, we select two anti-pseudomonal antibiotics that have different mechanisms of action, although the need for dual therapy is controversial. (See <a href=\"#H173942654\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For treatment of acute exacerbations, we suggest 10 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy rather than a shorter course (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Occasionally, a longer course is needed if the patient has resistant organisms or is improved but not yet back to baseline. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of acute exacerbations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have recurrent exacerbations, we suggest preventive therapy with a macrolide antibiotic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Our threshold for the initiation of preventive antibiotics is two to three exacerbations within one year. We obtain sputum stains and cultures to exclude nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection prior to initiating long-term macrolide therapy. Alternatively, for patients with recurrent exacerbations and <em>P. aeruginosa</em> in their sputum, we suggest a therapeutic trial of inhaled antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H173941937\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of exacerbations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that all patients with bronchiectasis regularly use airway clearance techniques to help remove airway secretions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78373 \">table 4</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
