The mother then develops antibodies against this paternal antigen and these antibodies cross the placenta and bind to the fetal platelets. Clearance of the antibody-coated platelets results in <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> thrombocytopenia; platelet function remains relatively normal. In contrast to Rh(D) alloimmunization, NAIT often affects a first pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Two plausible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the occurrence of maternal alloimmunization in NAIT. One mechanism involves maternal exposure to HPA on fetal platelets due to fetomaternal bleeding related to obstetrical complications, trauma, or delivery. The other mechanism is maternal exposure to integrin beta-3 on placental syncytiotrophoblast cells during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will provide a brief overview of NAIT and discuss parental evaluation and management of affected pregnancies.

The spectrum of fetal disease ranges from mild asymptomatic thrombocytopenia to severe thrombocytopenia leading to spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, which is often fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Intracranial hemorrhage is associated with platelet counts primarily less than <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL,</span> particularly less than <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Extracranial fetal hemorrhage is extremely rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>NAIT often affects the first pregnancy of an at-risk couple, but is not suspected until after delivery unless the mother&rsquo;s sister has a history of an affected child, fetal intracranial hemorrhage is noted on an ultrasound examination, or prenatal screening has been performed. Intracranial hemorrhage occurs in 7 to 26 percent of NAIT, and up to 75 percent of these hemorrhages occur prenatally between 20 weeks of gestation and term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/1,3,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,7-9</a>].</p><p>Most NAIT involves a father who is human platelet antigen <span class=\"nowrap\">(HPA)-1a/1a</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">1a/1b</span> and a mother who is <span class=\"nowrap\">HPA-1b/1b</span> with anti-HPA-1a antibodies. Approximately 98 percent of Caucasians express HPA-1a <span class=\"nowrap\">(HPA-1a/1a</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">1a/1b)</span> and 2 percent are HPA-1a negative (HPA-1b homozygotes). Anti HPA-1a (an immunoglobulin G antibody) has been detected in about 10 percent of HPA-1a negative pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The HPA-5b antigen is the second most common platelet antigen causing NAIT in Caucasians; platelet antigens HPA-1b and HPA-15 are also relatively common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In Asians, the HPA-4 system is the most frequent cause of NAIT. More than 20 other platelet antigens have been associated with NAIT, but these other antigen systems are rare, except for HPA-3 and HPA-9b [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The severity of NAIT is affected by several factors, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/3,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy order &ndash; Although data from retrospective studies suggest that the second pregnancy is more severely affected than the first pregnancy, the only prospective study did not confirm these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In 29 subsequent pregnancies of HPA-1a-immunized untreated women initially detected in a platelet antibody screening study, paired data showed that the neonatal platelet count in the subsequent pregnancy was the same or higher in 70 percent of cases compared with the screening (index) pregnancy. When the index pregnancy was complicated by NAIT, neonatal platelet counts in the subsequent pregnancy were the same or higher in two-thirds of cases. When the index pregnancy was complicated by severe thrombocytopenia, neonatal platelet counts in the subsequent pregnancy were the same or higher in 29 percent of cases. These findings, if confirmed in more and larger studies, suggest that NAIT may not be consistently more severe in subsequent pregnancies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level of maternal HPA-1a antibody &ndash; A low level of maternal HPA-1a antibody may be associated with a low risk of NAIT, while a high and rising level may be predictive of neonatal thrombocytopenia. In the prospective study described above in which 14 neonates had severe thrombocytopenia in the index pregnancy, 10 subsequent siblings also had a low platelet count, which was associated with an increase in maternal HPA-1a antibody level compared with the index pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Maternal antibody levels fell in the four pregnancies in which subsequent siblings had a higher platelet count. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcome of previous pregnancies &ndash; Prenatal intracranial hemorrhage in an affected sibling increases the probability of prenatal intracranial hemorrhage in subsequent fetuses, and the hemorrhage is likely to occur earlier in gestation. When a previous sibling had an intracranial hemorrhage, there is an 80 to 90 percent chance that the next affected sibling will also have an intracranial hemorrhage, unless in utero treatment is administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet antigen &ndash; HPA-1a alloimmunization causes severe disease; HPA-5b alloimmunization is less severe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA type &ndash; In homozygous HPA-1b women who are not pregnant or early in their first pregnancy, the absence of maternal HLA DRB3 0101 is highly predictive of alloimmunization not developing (negative predictive value 99.6 percent), while its presence has a positive predictive value of 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, antenatal intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may be more effective in HLA <span class=\"nowrap\">DRB3*0101(+)/HLA</span> DRB4*0101P(+) women than for HLA <span class=\"nowrap\">DRB3*0101(+)/HLA</span> DRB4*0101P(&ndash;) women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of anti&ndash;HPA-1a antibodies of alpha-v beta-3 subtype specificity in maternal sera.

Elegant murine models of NAIT have clearly demonstrated that the presence of specific anti-beta antibodies, and not the presence of thrombocytopenia, were responsible for fetal intracranial hemorrhage. These anti-beta antibodies led to intracranial hemorrhage in the absence of thrombocytopenia by inhibiting angiogenic signaling, thereby inducing endothelial cell apoptosis and decreasing blood vessel density in the brain and retina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These studies may explain why intracerebral hemorrhage does not occur in all cases of severe fetal thrombocytopenia and in the occasional case where the fetal platelet count is normal.</p><p/><p>In humans, maternal anti-platelet antibodies have not been associated with miscarriage or impaired placental function, except for a single anecdotal report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In a mouse model, maternal anti-platelet antibodies to anti-GPIb alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], anti-beta3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] have been associated with a high risk of miscarriage, which could be prevented by maternal administration of intravenous IgG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], a monoclonal antibody specific to the Fc receptor, or low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

This evaluation is described below and illustrated in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95887\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef95887 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>Typically, maternal and paternal human platelet antigen testing is performed simultaneously, looking for a potential incompatibility for the human platelet antigen <span class=\"nowrap\">(HPA)-1a/b</span> antigen system, the most common cause of NAIT in Caucasians. Reference laboratories vary in the number of platelet alloantigens screened. They typically test for HPA-1a and b, 3a and b, 4a and b, and 5a and b, and a variety of less common platelet antigens, but cannot test for every platelet antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In addition to determining whether a parental platelet antigen incompatibility exists, screening the maternal serum for HPA antibodies must be performed to determine whether the mother has specific antibodies directed against the antigen missing from her platelets, but present on the father&rsquo;s platelets. A commonly employed reference laboratory test is a crossmatch between maternal serum and paternal platelet glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> (GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa),</span> the site of most of the significant platelet antigens involved with NAIT; however, this test will not detect antibodies directed at rare polymorphisms not located on paternal <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/GPa</span> structures. Testing maternal serum against paternal platelets helps to detect these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A common test is the modified antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (MACE), which is a two-step procedure that screens for the presence of antibodies in maternal serum directed against paternal platelet glycoprotein complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Antibodies against human leukocyte antigens (HLA) or ABO antigens will often be identified.

However, this principle has been challenged by the small prospective study described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. More data are needed to determine whether maternal anti-HPA-1a antibody titers may be useful for risk assessment and to help select appropriate candidates for glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin therapy.

Platelet antigens are inherited as codominant genes. When the maternal genotype is <span class=\"nowrap\">HPA-1b/1b,</span> approximately 25 percent of fathers will be heterozygous <span class=\"nowrap\">HPA-1a/1b</span> and 50 percent of their progeny will also be <span class=\"nowrap\">HPA-1a/1b</span> and at-risk of NAIT. The other 75 percent of fathers will be homozygous <span class=\"nowrap\">HPA-1a/1a</span> and 100 percent of their progeny will be <span class=\"nowrap\">HPA-1a/1b</span> and at-risk of NAIT.

Three out of 104 neonates had an ICH diagnosed on postnatal ultrasound; all three ICH were grade 1, and none were associated with neurologic sequelae. The birth platelet counts for these three cases were <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100,000/microL</span>. Two of the neonates were born prematurely by cesarean delivery: one for HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets) at 29 weeks and the other from preeclampsia at 32 weeks. The third infant was born vaginally at 37 weeks. The majority of patients (n = 80) underwent cordocentesis around 32 weeks, and none underwent an initial cordocentesis prior to therapy. Based upon a 12.5 percent complication rate associated with cordocentesis, this procedure would only be performed to determine if the fetal platelet count was adequate for patients desiring to deliver vaginally.</p><p>The rationale for an escalated approach to therapy at 32 weeks was based upon data from previous randomized trial demonstrating that both IVIG 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/week</span> and IVIG 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/week</span> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> were effective and had similar efficacy in preventing severe fetal thrombocytopenia in 73 standard risk pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In this trial, the fetal platelet count was checked at 32 weeks and salvage therapy (IVIG 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/week</span> plus prednisone 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> was administered if the platelet count was <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;30,000/microL,</span> which occurred in 27 percent of the higher-dose IVIG group and 17 percent of the lower-dose IVIG plus prednisone group. The salvage regimen maintained or raised the platelet count in all but one case; two grade 1 neonatal intracranial hemorrhages occurred but were not due to treatment failure (platelet counts at birth 133 and <span class=\"nowrap\">197,000/microL,</span> respectively). This trial established the efficacy of the salvage regimen for treatment of standard risk pregnancies and provided indirect evidence that cordocentesis, with its attendant risks, could be avoided if this regimen was used as primary therapy. </p><p>The optimal dose of IVIG therapy in standard risk pregnancies (prior <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/neonate</span> with thrombocytopenia and no ICH) is still under investigation.

The difference between groups was not statistically significant, but the study lacked power to prove equivalence for the two doses. It should be noted that (1) there were no cases of fetal or neonatal ICH in either group and (2) platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL</span> occurred in 25 percent in the 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/week</span> group and 36 percent in the 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/week</span> group, and these counts were lower than those reported in the randomized trial described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The authors then performed a cohort study using data from the international web-based No IntraCranial Haemorrhage (NOICH) database to compare outcomes of 63 women treated with IVIG 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/week</span> versus 46 women treated with IVIG 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/week</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

We begin testing at 12 weeks of pregnancy and repeat at 24 and 32 weeks of gestation. If the specific antibody associated with the platelet incompatibility is detected, then we offer the management protocol for standard risk pregnancies because NAIT frequently occurs in the first pregnancy (see <a href=\"#H653699419\" class=\"local\">'Standard risk pregnancies'</a> above).<strong> </strong>We perform serial ultrasound examinations after 20 weeks to look for intracranial hemorrhage. In the largest worldwide registry of NAIT cases, 70 percent of cases of NAIT with intracranial hemorrhage were in first-born children<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-alloimmune-thrombocytopenia-parental-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>If screening was performed because the patient's sister has a child with suspected or confirmed NAIT, we follow this same protocol if a platelet incompatibility is detected.

The progress made in the prevention and treatment of this disease has occurred as a result of clinical trials dedicated to determining optimum management strategies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NAIT is a disorder in which fetal platelets contain an antigen inherited from the father that the mother lacks. The mother then develops antibodies against this paternal antigen and these antibodies cross the placenta and bind to the fetal platelets. Clearance of the antibody-coated platelets results in <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> thrombocytopenia. Antibodies to human platelet antigen (HPA)-1a are the most common cause of NAIT. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening all pregnant women to identify those who are at risk of NAIT due to maternal-fetal HPA-1a discordancy is costly, and the optimal management of these women is unknown. We suggest not routinely screening pregnant women for HPA-1a (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We perform maternal and paternal platelet antigen typing, as well as maternal human anti-platelet antibody evaluation when the woman or her sister has an obstetrical history suggestive of this diagnosis (eg, fetal death due to intracranial hemorrhage, neonatal thrombocytopenia of undetermined etiology). We perform paternal platelet antigen genotyping if the fetus is at risk of NAIT. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Parental testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fetus is not at risk of NAIT if it does not carry the platelet antigen that caused maternal alloimmunization, therefore, the fetal genotype should be determined if the father is heterozygous of HPA incompatibility. (See <a href=\"#H653698956\" class=\"local\">'Fetal platelet typing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracranial hemorrhage is responsible for most neonatal morbidity and mortality, occurs in 7 to 20 percent of cases, and up to 75 percent of these cases occur antenatally. It is associated with platelet counts primarily less than <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL,</span> particularly less than <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span>. Fetuses at highest risk are those in whom a fetal intracranial hemorrhage occurred in a previous affected sibling: The earlier the intracranial hemorrhage occurred in the previous sibling, the greater the risk for intracranial hemorrhage in the currently affected fetus. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The high occurrence of in utero fetal bleeding is the basis for initiating treatment to raise the platelet count prenatally, rather than waiting until after birth. Options include maternal glucocorticoid therapy and maternal intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Treatment significantly reduces but does not eliminate the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Severity-based approach for managing pregnancies at risk of NAIT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal blood sampling is reserved for patients who want to attempt a trial of labor and vaginal delivery. An in utero transfusion of platelet concentrate should be performed at the time of fetal blood sampling if the fetal platelet count is less than <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL,</span> in order to avoid exsanguination from the cordocentesis insertion site.
