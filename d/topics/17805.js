Thus, the management of hypocalcemia depends upon the severity of symptoms. In patients with acute symptomatic hypocalcemia, intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> is the preferred therapy, whereas chronic hypocalcemia is treated with oral calcium and vitamin D supplements.</p><p>The treatment of hypocalcemia will be reviewed here. The etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic approach to hypocalcemia are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypocalcemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to hypocalcemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoparathyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoparathyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION OF SERUM CALCIUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium in serum is bound to proteins, principally albumin. As a result, total serum calcium concentrations in patients with low or high serum albumin levels may not accurately reflect the physiologically important ionized (or free) calcium concentration. As an example, in patients with hypoalbuminemia (as may occur in patients with acute or chronic illness, volume overload, or malnutrition), total serum calcium concentration may be low when serum ionized calcium is normal. This phenomenon is called pseudohypocalcemia.</p><p>The serum total calcium concentration falls approximately 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> for every 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> reduction in the serum albumin concentration. Thus, in patients with hypoalbuminemia or hyperalbuminemia, the measured serum calcium concentration should be corrected for the abnormality in albumin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-calcium-correction-in-hypoalbuminemia\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or for standard units (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-calcium-correction-in-hypoalbuminemia-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). Patients with normal corrected serum calcium concentrations do not have true hypocalcemia and, therefore, do not require treatment for hypocalcemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypocalcemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Hypoalbuminemia'</a>.)</p><p>If there is uncertainty whether the corrected serum calcium is reflective of the ionized calcium and if a laboratory known to measure ionized calcium reliably is available, it is preferable to measure the ionized calcium directly. Direct measurement of the ionized calcium concentration can also be measured in patients with symptoms of hypocalcemia in the setting of a normal total calcium concentration. Symptomatic hypocalcemia with normal total calcium, but low ionized calcium can occasionally occur in patients with acute respiratory alkalosis due to increased binding of calcium to albumin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=relation-between-total-and-ionized-serum-calcium-concentrations#H30614447\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations&quot;, section on 'Acid-base disorders'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with asymptomatic hypocalcemia, it is important to verify with repeat measurement of ionized calcium or total serum calcium corrected for albumin that there is a true decrease in the calcium concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend intravenous (IV) calcium for the treatment of hypocalcemia in patients with (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F115835\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115835 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms (carpopedal spasm, tetany, seizures)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prolonged QT interval</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In asymptomatic patients with an acute decrease in serum corrected calcium to &le;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p/><p>For those with milder symptoms of neuromuscular irritability (paresthesias) and corrected calcium concentrations greater than 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> oral calcium supplementation can be initiated.

Long-term management requires the addition of vitamin D. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-84-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1-84)</a> is available for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism but is not yet standard care, because of the high cost and the necessity for subcutaneous administration.

Most recommendations are based upon accepted practice or clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypocalcemia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The treatment of hypocalcemia varies with its severity and the underlying cause. The severity of symptoms (paresthesias, carpopedal spasm, tetany, seizures) and signs (Chvostek's or Trousseau's signs, bradycardia, impaired cardiac contractility, and prolongation of the QT interval) depends upon the absolute level of calcium, as well as the rate of decrease. Patients with acute hypocalcemia will be symptomatic at serum calcium values that would not cause symptoms in patients with chronic hypocalcemia (eg, hypoparathyroidism). Clinical manifestations also vary with other factors such as the arterial pH and the cause of hypocalcemia.

We also suggest IV calcium for asymptomatic patients with an acute decrease in serum corrected calcium to &le;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> who may develop serious complications if untreated. Acute hypocalcemia can occur when there is a rapid and progressive reduction in serum calcium (eg, acute hypoparathyroidism following post-radical neck dissection for head and neck cancer).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravenous calcium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initially, IV calcium (1 or 2 g of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a>, equivalent to 90 or 180 mg elemental calcium, in 50 mL of 5 percent dextrose or normal saline) can be infused over 10 to 20 minutes. The calcium should not be given more rapidly, because of the risk of serious cardiac dysfunction, including systolic arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypocalcemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> should be monitored closely for acute digitalis toxicity, which can develop with calcium infusion. This dose of calcium gluconate will raise the serum calcium concentration for only two or three hours; as a result, it should be followed by a slow infusion of calcium in patients with persistent hypocalcemia.</p><p>Either 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> (90 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) or 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a> (270 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) can be used to prepare the infusion solution. Calcium gluconate is usually preferred because it is less likely to cause tissue necrosis if extravasated.</p><p>An IV solution containing 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> of elemental calcium is prepared by adding 11 g of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> (equivalent to 1000 mg elemental calcium) to normal saline or 5 percent dextrose water to provide a final volume of 1000 mL. This solution is administered at an initial infusion rate of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> (equivalent to 50 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">elemental/hour)</span>. The dose can be adjusted to maintain the serum calcium concentration at the lower end of the normal range (with the serum calcium corrected for any abnormalities in serum albumin as noted above). Patients typically require 0.5 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of elemental calcium per hour.</p><p>The infusion should be prepared with the following considerations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The calcium should be diluted in dextrose and water or saline because concentrated calcium solutions are irritating to veins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The IV solution should not contain bicarbonate or phosphate, which can form insoluble calcium salts. If these anions are needed, another IV line (in another limb) should be used.</p><p/><p>IV calcium should be continued until the patient is receiving an effective regimen of oral calcium and vitamin D. For patients with hypoparathyroidism, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> (in a dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mcg twice daily) and oral calcium (1 to 4 g of elemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> daily in divided doses) should be initiated as soon as possible. Calcitriol is the preferred preparation of vitamin D for patients with severe acute hypocalcemia because of its rapid onset of action (hours). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoparathyroidism#H1747045\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoparathyroidism&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>IV calcium is <strong>not</strong> warranted as initial therapy for asymptomatic hypocalcemia in patients with impaired renal function in whom correction of hyperphosphatemia and of low circulating 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D are usually the primary goals.

More careful monitoring is required in patients who have impaired renal function who are at greater risk of developing hypermagnesemia.</p><p>Persistent hypomagnesemia, as occurs in some patients with ongoing gastrointestinal (eg, malabsorption) or renal losses, requires supplementation with oral magnesium, typically 300 to 400 mg daily divided into three doses.

Attainment of higher values is not necessary and is usually limited by the development of hypercalciuria due to the loss of renal calcium-retaining effects of PTH. Monitoring of urinary and serum calcium and serum phosphate is required weekly initially, until a stable serum calcium concentration (at the low end of the normal range) is reached. Thereafter, monitoring at three- to six-month intervals is sufficient. For patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism who cannot maintain stable serum and urinary calcium levels with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-84-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1-84)</a> is an option.

In the setting of uncomplicated vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D2 or D3 corrects the deficiency and returns the patient's physiology to normal. Vitamin D is available in several doses for oral administration. We typically treat nutritional vitamin D deficiency with 50,000 international units of vitamin D2 or D3 weekly for six to eight weeks. In some countries (not in the United States), vitamin D is also available for parenteral administration. Vitamin D metabolites (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a>, dihydrotachysterol, calcidiol) can be used to treat hypocalcemia, particularly when there is abnormal vitamin D metabolism (renal or liver disease). The major advantage of vitamin D over vitamin D metabolites is its low cost, which is approximately 20 percent that of the vitamin D metabolites. Disadvantages include the necessity for hepatic and renal metabolism and slow onset and long duration of action.

Increased activity of CaSR in the renal tubules results in normal or high urinary calcium excretion despite hypocalcemia; raising the patient's serum calcium concentrations with calcium and vitamin D can result in more hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and renal insufficiency. Fortunately, most patients with this disorder have few if any symptoms of hypocalcemia and usually require little or no therapy. Recombinant human PTH, which enhances calcium absorption in the tubules, may be an alternative if therapy is needed. It can raise the serum calcium concentration in this disorder with a low risk of exacerbating hypercalciuria. Alternatively, calcilytics, a class of drugs in development that inhibit the CaSR, may provide a useful therapeutic approach in the future.

We also suggest IV calcium therapy in asymptomatic patients with an acute decrease in serum corrected calcium to &le;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H596754\" class=\"local\">'Severe acute and/or symptomatic hypocalcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">IV calcium is <strong>not</strong> warranted as initial therapy for asymptomatic hypocalcemia in patients with impaired renal function in whom correction of hyperphosphatemia and of low circulating 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D are usually the primary goals. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous calcium'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Chronic kidney disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those with milder symptoms of neuromuscular irritability (paresthesias) and corrected serum calcium concentrations greater than 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> initial treatment with oral calcium supplementation is sufficient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F115835\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115835 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H596853\" class=\"local\">'Mildly symptomatic or chronic hypocalcemia'</a> above). If symptoms do not improve with oral supplementation, IV calcium infusion is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">IV calcium is also indicated to prevent acute hypocalcemia in patients with milder degrees of hypocalcemia or chronic hypocalcemia (due to hypoparathyroidism) who become unable to take or absorb oral supplements, as may occur after complex surgical procedures requiring prolonged recuperation. (See <a href=\"#H596853\" class=\"local\">'Mildly symptomatic or chronic hypocalcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To effectively treat hypocalcemia in patients with concurrent magnesium deficiency, hypomagnesemia should be corrected first. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Concurrent hypomagnesemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When hypoparathyroidism (transient or permanent) or vitamin D deficiency are the cause of hypocalcemia, administration of IV calcium is only transiently effective (as long as the infusion continues), and oral calcium may not be well absorbed. In these cases, successful management requires the addition of vitamin D, which often permits a lower dose of calcium supplementation. (See <a href=\"#H596853\" class=\"local\">'Mildly symptomatic or chronic hypocalcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with hypoparathyroidism require lifelong calcium and vitamin D supplementation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58328\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58328 \">table 2</a>). For patients with permanent hypoparathyroidism, the goals of therapy are to relieve symptoms, raise and maintain the serum calcium concentration in the low-normal range (eg, 8.0 to 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.0 to 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> and avoid hypercalciuria (maintain 24-hour urinary calcium below 300 mg). For patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism who cannot maintain stable serum and urinary calcium levels with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, the addition of recombinant parathyroid hormone (1-84) is an option. However, the long-term safety of parathyroid hormone (PTH) has not been established. In addition, recombinant PTH is much more expensive than standard therapy with calcium and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a>.

Nutritional deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> requires initial treatment with 50,000 international units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d2-ergocalciferol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin D2</a> or D3 orally once per week for six to eight weeks, and then 800 to 1000 international units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d3-cholecalciferol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin D3</a> daily thereafter.
