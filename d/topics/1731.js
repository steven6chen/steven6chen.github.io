The most important initial issues are avoidance of delay in administering therapy and the choice of drug regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance of delay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic therapy should be initiated immediately after lumbar puncture (LP) is performed if the clinical suspicion for meningitis is high (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74865\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74865 \">algorithm 1</a>). Delay in the administration of appropriate antibiotics can have a deleterious effect on outcome for patients who are deteriorating rapidly.</p><p>If computed tomography (CT) scan is to be performed before LP, antibiotic therapy should be initiated immediately after blood cultures are obtained, before the CT is performed. Although the administration of antimicrobial therapy before LP may affect the yield of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram stain and culture, pathogens other than meningococcus usually can be identified in the CSF up to several hours after the administration of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

This principle is supported by clinical observations of poor outcomes in patients receiving bacteriostatic therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clindamycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tetracycline</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], as well as direct experimental evidence in which bactericidal antibiotic therapy resulted in optimal microbiologic cure and survival in animals with pneumococcal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Chloramphenicol</a> is a bacteriostatic drug for most enteric Gram-negative rods; however, it usually is bactericidal for <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>, and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and has been used extensively and successfully to treat meningitis caused by these organisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug entry into CSF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of bacterial meningitis requires adequate concentration of antibiotics in the CSF. Most drugs reach peak concentrations in the CSF that are only 10 to 20 percent of peak concentrations in the serum. This is because the blood-brain barrier blocks macromolecule entry into the CSF, with small, lipophilic molecules penetrating most easily.</p><p>The peak concentration of drugs in CSF increases with inflammation of the blood-brain barrier. This was illustrated in one study that sequentially monitored CSF and serum penicillin levels in children with bacterial meningitis. The mean <span class=\"nowrap\">CSF/serum</span> ratio two hours after administration of the same intravenous dose of penicillin was 42 percent on the first day of therapy but fell to less than 10 percent on the 10<sup>th</sup> day, when the inflammatory changes had subsided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Oral antibiotics should be avoided, since the dose and tissue levels tend to be considerably lower than with parenteral agents. One exception can be made for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chloramphenicol</a>, which has been administered successfully by the oral route to treat <em>H. influenzae</em> type b (Hib) meningitis in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of regimen depends upon whether the pathogen is known, since regimens for empiric therapy pose a different set of management issues than do those used to treat known pathogens.
