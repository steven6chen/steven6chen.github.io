Although it is common, the complaint should not be ignored because children with functional constipation will benefit from prompt and thorough treatment interventions. Delayed or inadequate intervention may result in stool withholding behavior with worsening constipation and psychosocial consequences.</p><p>The clinician also has an important role in identifying the small fraction of children with organic causes of constipation. Organic causes of constipation are more likely among young infants, and among infants and children presenting with atypical features or &quot;alarm signs&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94989 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>The clinical features that are typical for functional constipation are described in this topic review, and features of specific organic causes of constipation are summarized briefly.

This definition is operationalized by the &quot;Rome IV&quot; diagnostic criteria, which require at least two of six symptoms describing stool frequency, hardness, size, fecal incontinence, or volitional stool retention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57882 \">table 2</a>), with the stipulation that organic causes of constipation are excluded by a thorough evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>The extent of the diagnostic evaluation to exclude organic causes is not specifically defined. In most cases, organic causes of constipation can be excluded on the basis of a careful history and physical examination. Focused laboratory and radiographic testing should be performed for children with atypical features (warning signs of possible organic constipation), or for those who fail to respond to a well-conceived and carefully administered intervention program, including disimpaction, frequent and effective use of laxatives, and behavioral management for at least six months. Selection of tests is discussed separately.

Because of changes with growth and development, the frequency and type of stools must be compared with normal patterns expected for the child's age, diet, and stage of maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the full-term newborn infant, the first bowel movement usually occurs within 36 hours of birth, but may happen later in infants who are born prematurely; 90 percent of normal newborns pass meconium within the first 24 hours of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the first week of life, infants pass a mean of four stools per day, although this is variable depending upon whether infants are breastfed or receiving formula.

The mean total gastrointestinal transit time is 8.5 hours at 1 to 3 months of age, 16 hours at 4 to 24 months, 26 hours at 3 to 13 years of age, and 30 to 48 hours after puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703999406\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three periods during which the infant and developing child are particularly prone to develop functional constipation. The first occurs after the introduction of cereals and solid food into the infant's diet, the second with toilet training, and the third during the start of school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These important developmental milestones can be positive experiences. On the other hand, each of these milestones can convert defecation into an unpleasant experience. That unhappy experience may prompt the child to try to avoid repeating it, leading to behaviors that promote constipation.</p><p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) appear to predispose to functional constipation with or without fecal incontinence. In a referral population, nearly 30 percent of children with functional constipation had an ASD as detected by screening questionnaires; these children tended to be older and had longer duration of symptoms as compared with children without ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is likely that the rate of ASD is considerably lower in a non-referral or younger population of children. Similarly, functional constipation and associated fecal incontinence are particularly common among children with attention <span class=\"nowrap\">deficit/hyperactivity</span> disorder (ADHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The mechanism for the association between ADHD and functional constipation is not clear but may include atypical sensory processing or ignoring of sensory stimuli, or other factors that interfere with the normal progress of toilet training.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H704003007\"><span class=\"h2\">Painful defecation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Painful defecation is a common trigger for stool withholding, and contributes to the development and persistence of chronic constipation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55786\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55786 \">table 3</a>). When the child avoids defecation because of pain, stool accumulates in the rectum and becomes hard, causing even more pain when they are passed. The underlying problem of constipation must be addressed promptly to avoid this escalating cycle.</p><p>Children who withhold stool to avoid defecation because of pain or other negative experiences have a form of functional or behavioral constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The child's response to ignore the urge to defecate is probably a conscious decision initially but later becomes automatic. The only abnormal motor activity in most children with chronic constipation is found in the rectum, which may dilate to such an extent that insufficient pressure is generated to push the stool into the anal canal. Manometric studies have suggested that some constipated children have &quot;anismus,&quot; (contraction of the external sphincter when they try to defecate), but some experts consider this finding to be voluntary (ie, the manometric equivalent of withholding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In selected populations, such as children with severe slow-transit constipation refractory to standard treatment, abnormalities of colonic motility and histology have been reported, suggesting underlying neuromuscular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Painful defecation frequently precedes chronic fecal impaction and fecal soiling. As an example, a retrospective study reviewed 227 children (35 percent of whom were less than three years of age) who presented to a pediatric gastroenterologist with difficult defecation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Of the younger children, 86 percent presented with pain, 71 percent with impaction, and 97 percent with severe withholding. The younger children had painful defecation for a mean of 14 &plusmn; 9 months before presentation. Of the older children, 85 percent presented with fecal soiling, 57 percent with pain, 73 percent with fecal impaction, and 96 percent exhibited withholding. Sixty-three percent of the children presenting with fecal soiling had a history of painful defecation beginning before three years of age, prior to the development of fecal soiling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H704003029\"><span class=\"h2\">Toilet training issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toilet training is a developmental milestone that affects self-esteem and independence. To master toileting, a toddler must develop the ability and interest in retaining a bowel movement until it can be released into the toilet. This behavior frequently leads to less frequent defecation, and sometimes to hard and painful stools, which in turn lead to further voluntary withholding. The problem may be exacerbated if toilet training is vigorously encouraged before the child is developmentally ready. Power struggles may develop if toilet training is forced on a child by a parent, potentially leading to various problems, one of which is constipation.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) emphasizes that parents and caregivers should avoid coercing their children into toilet training and instead watch for signs that the child is developmentally ready [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Toilet training works best when it is aligned with the child's signs of readiness to progress past each phase. Visits to the healthcare provider can help parents anticipate and optimally manage the steps in the process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toilet-training\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toilet training&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H704003065\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The modern diet has been cited as a contributor to childhood constipation. Unlike previous generations, children today consume large amounts of highly processed food items at the expense of fruit, vegetables, and fiber. Although increasing the intake of fiber is often recommended for acute and chronic constipation, the evidence base for this practice is weak and somewhat conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. While a balanced diet including fruits, vegetables, and fiber is recommended in all children and may be useful in preventing or treating mild constipation, there is little evidence that adding fiber to the diet is an effective treatment for severe constipation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants and children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Fiber'</a>.) </p><p>In infants, the addition of cereals to the diet often causes the stools to be more formed, and sometimes triggers constipation. This trigger usually can be identified by a focused history. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of acute constipation in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Transition to solid diet'</a>.) </p><p>The relationship between cow's milk and constipation is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Some infants or children do seem to have improvement in constipation when switched from cow's milk to a soy formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. An allergic mechanism has been suggested, but not established. (See <a href=\"#H704000133\" class=\"local\">'Cow's milk intolerance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H704003076\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children in some families may be predisposed to developing constipation. In one longitudinal study, a family history of constipation was observed in more than one-half of children with chronic constipation and soiling seen over a seven-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The reasons for this familial tendency are not clear and may include shared genetic, environmental, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dietary factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703999947\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fecal incontinence (the preferred term over encopresis or soiling) is now included among the diagnostic criteria for functional constipation. This is because 80 percent of children with fecal incontinence have underlying constipation. Conversely, fecal incontinence ultimately develops in up to 50 percent of children with chronic refractory constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The likely mechanism is that with chronic rectal distension, the anal canal shortens and the internal anal sphincter dilates. In this state, a transient relaxation of the external anal sphincter releases semisolid stool onto the perianal skin and clothing. Among children with constipation, there are no clear differences in pathophysiology or psychology between those with and without fecal incontinence. This issue is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional fecal incontinence in infants and children: Definition, clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Abdominal pain is often associated with functional constipation but is not among the diagnostic criteria. About 90 percent of children presenting with recurrent abdominal pain have a functional etiology such as constipation or irritable bowel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In fact, one study suggests that clinicians tend to over-diagnose constipation and under-diagnose irritable bowel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H704003529\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Organic causes account for fewer than five percent of cases of constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/5,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26</a>]. These usually can be distinguished from functional constipation by clinical features on the history or physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79830 \">table 4</a>). The following sections will focus on the causes that are relatively frequent considerations in clinical practice and on less common disorders that may be easy to miss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94998\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94998 \">table 5</a>). The diagnostic process is described in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H704000033\"><span class=\"h2\">Infant dyschezia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dyschezia describes ineffective defecation, manifested as straining in the absence of constipation. Infant dyschezia is a functional disorder, defined as at least 10 minutes of straining and crying before successful passage of soft stool in an otherwise healthy infant younger than nine months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/3,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,28</a>]. The symptom is probably caused by failure to relax the pelvic floor during the defecation effort. In addition, infants also have inadequate abdominal muscle tone to produce a Valsalva maneuver.</p><p>Infant dyschezia generally resolves spontaneously as the infant matures, and reassurance of the parents is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Rectal stimulation may be counterproductive, and laxatives are generally unnecessary.</p><p>Infants with dyschezia must be distinguished from those with painful bowel movements due to formed stools or anal fissures, or those with food protein-induced proctitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96472\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96472 \">table 6</a>). Infants who experience pain while defecating can learn withholding behavior. This is manifested by stiffening of the body and turning red in the face, which appears very similar to infant dyschezia. Therefore, it is important to evaluate an infant with suspected dyschezia to determine whether the bowel movements are hard <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if there is any evidence of anal fissures or irritation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H704004324\"><span class=\"h2\">Hirschsprung disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hirschsprung disease is an important consideration in newborns and young infants presenting with constipation. Hirschsprung disease is a motor disorder of the colon caused by the congenital absence of ganglion cells in the rectum and distal colon. As a result, the affected segment of the colon fails to relax, causing a functional obstruction. Although it is uncommon (approximately 1 in 5000 live births), prompt diagnosis is important to avoid complications, which may be life-threatening. Hirschsprung disease is associated with several congenital abnormalities and syndromes, including Down syndrome and cardiac disease (especially septal defects). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hirschsprung disease should be suspected in the following circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/19,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of symptoms in the first week of life</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed passage of meconium (first meconium passed after 48 hours of life)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal distension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A transition zone on a contrast enema</p><p/><p>Hirschsprung disease usually is diagnosed in newborns or within the first few months of life. Other causes of constipation or delayed passage of meconium in the early neonatal period are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82181\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82181 \">table 7</a>). Infrequently, Hirschsprung disease may not be diagnosed until later in infancy or childhood if the disease is milder (eg, &quot;ultra-short segment&quot; Hirschsprung disease). Such patients typically have a history of chronic constipation and failure to thrive. The physical examination may reveal a tight anal canal and empty ampulla. Very rarely, Hirschsprung disease is diagnosed in adulthood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H704000133\"><span class=\"h2\">Cow's milk intolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association between cow's milk consumption and constipation is suggested by observations of improvement after elimination of cow's milk from the diet in some infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. As an example, one study focused on 65 children (ages 11 to 72 months) with chronic constipation who had been referred to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Patients were given cow or soy milk for two weeks; feedings were reversed after a one-week washout period. Improvement in constipation was observed in 68 percent of children when fed with soy milk compared with none of the children with cow's milk. </p><p>The mechanism of this association is unclear, but an allergic basis has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In the study described above, responding children were more likely to have coexistent rhinitis, dermatitis, or bronchospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. They were also more likely to have anal fissures and erythema or edema at baseline, evidence of inflammation of the rectal mucosa, and signs of hypersensitivity (such as specific immunoglobulin E [IgE] antibodies to cow's milk antigens). It is possible that constipation in this subset of children is a manifestation of a cow's milk &quot;protein intolerance,&quot; which typically manifests during infancy as colitis or enterocolitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>It remains possible that an association between cow's milk and constipation is explained by nonspecific mechanisms, similar to the changes in stool consistency caused by other dietary changes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1006631541\"><span class=\"h2\">Slow-transit constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Slow transit constipation describes a subgroup of patients with children with abnormally slow movement of food residue through the colon, in whom no underlying disease can be identified. It is generally defined as a colon transit time &gt;100 hours as defined by radiopaque markers.

Most children with slow transit constipation have no identifiable underlying disease or pathological finding. Typical features of patients with refractory slow transit constipation are symptoms of severe constipation within one year of age, or treatment-resistant encopresis at two to three years of age, and soft stools despite infrequent bowel movements (passing less than one stool a week), as well as lack of response to optimal standard therapy with laxatives and behavioral intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. </p><p>These children are managed in the same way as other children with functional constipation, but they have a worse prognosis for prompt recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Some of these children respond to standard treatment with laxatives and behavioral interventions. Most develop chronic intractable disease and have a poor outcome. We suggest early referral to a gastroenterologist for patients with this profile.

Infantile botulism is the most frequent form of the disease with a mean of 71 cases annually in the United States and a mortality rate up to 5 percent. Honey has been directly linked to infant botulism. Corn syrup, although implicated, has never been directly linked with botulism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botulism&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Disease presentation and severity are quite variable in infant botulism, most likely as a result of size of the bacterial inoculum and host susceptibility. The initial presentation may simply involve constipation, shortly followed by weakness, feeding difficulties, descending or global hypotonia, drooling, anorexia, irritability, and weak cry. The autonomic nervous system is usually affected first with findings of dry mucous membranes, blood pressure instability, arrhythmias, as well as fecal and urinary retention. This is generally followed by descending motor weakness beginning with the cranial nerves, followed by trunk and then limb involvement.

A few newborn infants with thyroid dyshormonogenesis have a palpable goiter, but this finding usually appears later. More than 95 percent of newborn infants with congenital hypothyroidism have few, if any, clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism because some T4 crosses the placenta.

In one review, all patients with the combination of MEN2A with Hirschsprung disease (MEN2A-HD) were operated on for Hirschsprung disease 2 to 63 years before being diagnosed with MEN2. All patients had been underweight as infants and had symptoms of abdominal pain, distention, and constipation. Some also had hematochezia, emesis, or intermittent diarrhea before surgery. The majority of patients with MEN2B also had gastrointestinal symptoms 1 to 24 years before being diagnosed with MEN2, including flatulence (86 percent), abdominal distention or being underweight as a child (64 percent), abdominal pain (54 percent), constipation or diarrhea (43 percent), difficulty swallowing (39 percent), and vomiting (14 percent). MEN2B is characterized by transmural intestinal ganglioneuromas, which can be identified on rectal suction or full-thickness biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].

The symptoms must be present for one month in infants and toddlers, and two months in older children. The diagnosis also requires exclusion of organic causes of the symptoms.
