A variety of other disease manifestations may also be present, including additional issues related to exocrine gland dysfunction, such as dryness of the skin, nasal passages, and vagina; extraglandular involvement; and systemic symptoms, such as fever and malaise. Both local and systemic medical therapies are used in the treatment of the different manifestations of SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>The treatment of dry mouth, including topical therapy, the use of systemic cholinergic agents and other systemic therapies, and other therapies for the management of other non-ocular sicca symptoms of SS will be reviewed here. Other issues in SS, including the clinical manifestations, the diagnosis, the treatment of dry eye, and the role of systemic therapy in extraglandular manifestations of SS, are discussed separately.

Thus, stimulation of existing salivary flow, providing lubrication, and treating fungal infection, along with close attention to dental care, are the major aspects of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/1,3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5,6</a>].</p><p>Our treatment approach is consistent with expert opinion and is supported by the evidence reviewed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Briefly, this approach includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic self-care measures to stimulate oral secretions and prevent oral dryness and dental caries, as well as regular preventive dental care.

Patients should be instructed regarding signs and symptoms of oral candidiasis, which may mimic or exacerbate dry mouth symptoms and require prompt intervention. Additionally, they should be cautioned regarding the risks of cosmetic dental procedures in the setting of severe salivary hypofunction. (See <a href=\"#H4618155\" class=\"local\">'Oral candidiasis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H24155844\" class=\"local\">'Restorative and cosmetic dentistry'</a> below.)</p><p>The published evidence supporting these measures is limited, largely consisting of small trials, case series, and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/1,6,7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7,9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H902090\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention of dryness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preventive measures against dry mouth include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of good hydration by taking regular sips of water, drinking sugar-free liquids, and avoidance of oral irritants (eg, coffee, alcohol, and nicotine).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of oral desiccants (eg, coffee, alcohol, tobacco and cannabis smoke).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of medications that may worsen oral dryness, especially those with anticholinergic side effects. These include over-the-counter cold and sleep remedies and other agents.

We suggest frequent sips of water because of convenience, cost, and efficacy. Sufficient water is needed to maintain adequate hydration. However, water used for moistening does not have to be swallowed; it can be rinsed around the mouth and then expectorated. Sucking on ice may be preferred by some patients. The addition of a small amount of liquid omega-3 oil to the water (&frac14; to &frac12; teaspoon per 16 oz) may enhance the wetting effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Although water provides temporary moisture, it does not provide the lubricating properties that are characteristic of the mucin and water mixtures that constitute normal saliva.</p><p>Patients should be advised that sipping water too often may be counter-productive, reducing the mucus film in the mouth and possibly worsening symptoms. If water consumption is excessive, especially in the evening, nocturia can occur, resulting in sleep disturbance that may worsen fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and pain that some patients experience.</p><p>We advise patients to avoid sipping highly acidic beverages, particularly between meals, since a sustained lowering of intraoral pH may adversely affect dental enamel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Examples of common beverages and their relative acidity include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cola drinks &ndash; pH 2.6</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coffee &ndash; pH 5.0</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tea (herbal) &ndash; pH 3.2</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tea (black) &ndash; pH 5.7 to 7.0</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Water from tap &ndash; pH 7.0 (but flavored waters are often acidic)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Energy drinks &ndash; Usually acidic</p><p/><p>The maintenance of a stable neutral pH in the oral cavity is highly important since this serves to decrease dental demineralization. The buffering systems responsible for the human saliva buffering capacity include bicarbonate, phosphate, and protein. Even a minor drop in pH can promote dental caries or can damage the teeth by erosion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The pH and buffering capacity of the parotid saliva of individuals with SS are much lower than those in healthy individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24155412\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanical and gustatory stimulation of salivary flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with dry mouth should use mechanical and gustatory stimulants, in addition to the basic measures described for prevention of dryness and dental care (see <a href=\"#H902090\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of dryness'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16911880\" class=\"local\">'Basic dental care and oral hygiene'</a> below). Salivary flow may be stimulated in patients with residual salivary function by sucking on sugar-free candies and lozenges and by using sugar-free chewing gums [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Particular care must be taken not to increase the risk of dental caries by the prolonged use of sugar-containing products and by avoidance of acidic drinks (eg, carbonated beverages and citrus juices). (See <a href=\"#H902090\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of dryness'</a> above.)</p><p>The choice of stimulatory agent largely depends upon patient preference. A clear advantage of one product over another has not been rigorously shown, and a variety of products should be tried to determine which is most acceptable and effective in a given patient. Although the use of highly acidic products is usually not advised, drops of lemon juice in a glass of water may be used to stimulate saliva production without dropping the pH sufficiently to damage dental enamel.</p><p>Products identified as &quot;sugarless&quot; should be distinguished from those that are &quot;sugar-free,&quot; as items identified as &quot;sugarless&quot; may contain significant amounts of fructose, thus being potentially cariogenic.</p><p>Examples of salivary stimulants include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sugar-free hard candies or lozenges.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sugar-free chewing gums containing various sweeteners such as aspartame, saccharin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>, which can increase saliva production in patients with residual secretory capacity. Excessive sorbitol can lead to gastrointestinal side effects such as cramps and diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Xylitol-containing gum or candy, which may also reduce the cariogenicity of the oral bacterial flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Citrus-flavored sugarless tablets or oral drops, which may also contain malic acid.

Additionally, most of the products were not tested in patients with SS. However, some evidence suggested a patient preference for chewing gums, which may increase saliva production in patients with residual secretory capacity, although there was no evidence that gum was more or less effective than use of saliva substitutes. Additionally, chewing gums have the benefit that they enhance the patient's own saliva production so that taste and consistency are not an obstacle. The use of these interventions is also supported by extensive clinical experience.</p><p>Another type of salivary stimulant is a topically applied oral insert that adheres to the mucosa. It may stimulate salivary flow and alleviate symptoms of dryness in some patients, but it has been the subject of only limited study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16911880\"><span class=\"h3\">Basic dental care and oral hygiene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Particular attention to basic dental care is important for all patients with dry mouth; the development of dental caries is a major problem in such patients, who are especially prone to rapidly progressing root and incisal caries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/1,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16-18</a>]. To help avoid these complications, we suggest aggressive application of the same general dental hygiene principles as in individuals without dry mouth, including meticulous self-care, frequent visits to the dentist (at least every six months for patients with mild disease), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoride</a> supplementation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F114362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114362 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Patients should also avoid eating preprocessed &quot;sticky&quot; foods, which may be high in sugar content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18</a>], and sipping on sugary beverages frequently throughout the day.</p><p>We suggest that patients do the following under the supervision of their dentist:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use dental hygiene techniques regularly to remove trapped food debris and plaque. These include the use of dental floss and dental appliances such as interdental brushes (for cleaning between teeth) and electric toothbrushes. Use dental floss or another interdental cleaner after each meal. Toothbrushing should be done at least twice daily. We advise patients to carry a portable toothbrush and toothpaste to use when they will not be at home following meals. If this is not feasible, patients should at a minimum rinse their mouth with water after consuming any sugary substances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoride</a>, which is highly effective in reducing caries in dry mouth patients. Topical fluorides are available in many different strengths and formulations. The choice of formulation depends in part upon caries risk stratification and changes as caries' susceptibility increases. A caries risk assessment by a dental professional involves weighing multiple factors, including the baseline presence of frank caries, erosions of the enamel without penetration into the dentin, or recent (&lt;3 years) dental restoration; the presence of predisposing factors, such as high oral colony counts of cariogenic bacteria, poor dietary habits, absence of saliva, heavy dental plaque, exposed roots, and orthodontic appliances; and protective factors already in place, such as regular access to fluoridated water and use of fluoride toothpastes, varnishes, or rinses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We take the following approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F114362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114362 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with symptomatic dry mouth but without clinical signs of dry mouth and without recent caries can be treated with over-the-counter fluoride-containing mouth rinses.

Factors considered in this assessment include the rate of development of caries, the patient's carbohydrate exposure, and the degree of salivary hypofunction. Lack of lubrication in most over-the-counter toothpastes may contribute to irritation to the tongue and cheeks. Dry mouth toothpastes lack detergents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, which is the foaming agent in most toothpastes and which can irritate the mucosa; however, they do not contain prescription-strength concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoride</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Patients living in homes or areas without fluoridated water are at particular risk. The increasing use of non-fluoridated bottled water in place of fluoridated tap water has also decreased fluoride exposure for some patients.

Recognition of the clinical manifestations of chronic erythematous candidiasis, typically oral pain or burning, is the first step in effective treatment; these manifestations are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease#H2801192\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Exocrine gland disease&quot;, section on 'Oral candidiasis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-oropharyngeal-and-esophageal-candidiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The SS-related factors and strategies include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We usually initiate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> 100 mg tablets (two tablets on the first day followed by one tablet daily for 14 to 21 days) or once-daily use of an oral suspension of fluconazole (5 mL swish and swallow, containing 200 mg). In those patients with an inadequate response, we then use a topical oral antifungal preparation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Topical oral antifungal therapies are often required, unless there is esophageal involvement, because systemic antifungal therapy may not result in sufficient salivary drug concentrations in patients with severe salivary dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The approach to treating esophageal candidiasis, which requires systemic therapy, is described in detail separately.

The former treatment regimen resulted in significantly higher peak saliva concentrations and mean area under the concentration-versus-time curves from 0 to 24 hours. Thus, fluconazole oral suspension, swished for two minutes and then swallowed, has theoretical pharmacokinetic advantages over swallowing a tablet in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several commonly used antifungal preparations that contain sugars are potentially problematic for patients with SS and should be avoided in patients who require prolonged or repeated courses of a topical antifungal treatment. Many antifungal preparations contain sugars to improve taste, including the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clotrimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clotrimazole</a> troche, which is one of the most commonly used of these medications in patients without SS; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nystatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nystatin</a> oral suspension contains sugars as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sugar-free alternatives, which we prefer, include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=miconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">miconazole</a> mucoadhesive buccal tablets (eg, Oravig) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nystatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nystatin</a> vaginal troches or vaginal tablets. However, the latter are not available in the United States. Miconazole mucoadhesive buccal tablets are not always available in retail pharmacies and then have to be ordered online. An alternative approach is to prescribe troches containing 100,000 units of nystatin and flavored with artificial sweeteners from a compounding pharmacy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These antifungal troches and vaginal tablets should be dissolved slowly in the mouth over 15 to 20 minutes. Frequent sips of water may aid tablet dissolution in patients with little to no salivary flow; however, care must be taken as frequent rinsing may wash the product away. Troches and dissolvable tablets may not be appropriate in patients with severe salivary hypofunction due to problems with solubilizing the medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antifungal treatment should be continued for 7 to 10 days or until there is resolution of the mucosal erythema, restoration of filiform papillae on the dorsal tongue, and eradication of the oral symptoms (eg, burning, sensitivity to spicy foods, change in taste, and metallic taste). The endpoint of treatment should be relief of symptoms and resolution of the oral signs. With successful treatment, the tongue may regain its normal appearance. Treatment periods may sometimes need to be extended to three to four weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrences are common and will require retreatment. Patients with more than one recurrence can be treated prophylactically with repeat courses every month or the daily use of one troche or tablet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with partial or complete dentures, the topical oral antifungal treatment should be performed with the denture removed. Alternatively, if using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nystatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nystatin</a> powder, it can be sprinkled onto the tissue-contact surface of the removable denture prior to placing the denture in the mouth during the day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The dentures can be soaked overnight in 0.2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> or a dilute bleach solution (1 part household bleach to 10 parts water) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; however, use of the dilute bleach solution should be avoided with partial dentures containing metal connectors or clasps, as they may get corroded or tarnished.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24155524\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF OTHER SICCA SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should also be treated for other sicca symptoms in addition to dry eye and dry mouth; these include nasal dryness, laryngotracheal and genitourinary symptoms, and dry skin.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

These include maintaining good hydration; avoiding sucrose, carbonated beverages, juices, and water with additives; regularly sipping water; drinking sugar-free liquids; using sugar-free salivary stimulants; avoiding medications that may worsen dryness; and using a humidifier. (See <a href=\"#H24155398\" class=\"local\">'Basic measures for all patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SS should undergo regularly scheduled preventive dental care and be cared for by a dental hygienist and dentist with experience in dry mouth care whenever possible. Oral hygiene and dental self-care should include use of dental floss after meals, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoride</a> either as toothpaste or mouth rinse daily, and use of toothpastes specifically designed for dry mouth. Meticulous self-care, frequent visits to the dentist, and plaque control are necessary but are not always sufficient to completely prevent caries. (See <a href=\"#H16911880\" class=\"local\">'Basic dental care and oral hygiene'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with SS who get inadequate benefit from mechanical stimulation, topical stimulants of salivary flow, and sipping water, we suggest the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-saliva-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial saliva</a> for temporary symptomatic relief as the next step in therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Several different preparations should be tried to find which is the most helpful. (See <a href=\"#H1388608110\" class=\"local\">'Inadequate benefit from salivary stimulation and water'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with SS with salivary dysfunction and dry mouth who receive inadequate benefit from mechanical stimulation and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-saliva-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial saliva</a>, we suggest the use of a muscarinic agonist, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cevimeline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cevimeline</a>, as the next therapeutic option (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The usual dose of pilocarpine is 5 mg by mouth, four <span class=\"nowrap\">times/day,</span> and the usual dose of cevimeline is 30 mg by mouth, three <span class=\"nowrap\">times/day</span> taken about a half-hour before meals. The dose of medication should be increased gradually when initiating therapy. (See <a href=\"#H899135\" class=\"local\">'Inadequate response to salivary stimulation and substitutes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally do not use glucocorticoids or other systemic antiinflammatory or immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of sicca symptoms alone, such as dry eye and mouth, although some of these agents have beneficial effects in patients with systemic and extraglandular disease and a few have shown some efficacy for sicca symptoms, including dry mouth. (See <a href=\"#H316655\" class=\"local\">'Systemic antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with dental caries or very low salivary production should be evaluated by a dentist with expertise in dry mouth dentistry to determine if remineralizing mouth washes, special toothpastes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoride</a> applications, or other measures are required and to direct such care. (See <a href=\"#H319080\" class=\"local\">'Dental professional care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high level of suspicion for oral candidiasis should be maintained in patients with SS, especially in patients with mouth pain, burning, increased sensitivity, diffuse or patchy mucosal erythema, or white mucosal patches, and in patients with apparent resistance to treatment, so that the candidiasis is recognized early and treatment is promptly instituted. (See <a href=\"#H4618155\" class=\"local\">'Oral candidiasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sicca symptoms other than dry mouth may also require treatment. In addition to dry eye, these include nasal dryness, laryngotracheal and genitourinary symptoms, and dry skin. Patients with these manifestations may benefit from various topical measures, as well as from the use of muscarinic agonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cevimeline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cevimeline</a>.
