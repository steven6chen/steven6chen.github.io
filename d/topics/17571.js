Leprosy is an important global health concern; early diagnosis and a full course of treatment are critical for preventing lifelong neuropathy and disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Leprosy remains poorly understood and often feared by the general public and even by some in the healthcare professions, although (contrary to popular folklore) it is not highly contagious, and very effective treatment is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Multiple drug therapy has cured approximately 11 million patients over the last 15 to 20 years, but not all patients have access to the drugs and not all countries have the infrastructure to support leprosy control efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Worldwide, the number of dedicated leprosy programs is declining, and international migration is bringing patients to nearly every region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As a result, increasingly the treatment of leprosy is being delivered by clinicians with less and less experience.</p><p>Although the infection is highly responsive to treatment, disabilities of the eyes, hands, and feet due to neuropathy are often not reversible and may require lifelong care and rehabilitation. Therefore, early diagnosis and complete treatment are necessary to minimize the likelihood of these disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The treatment and prevention of leprosy are reviewed here.

Promine, a sulfone, was the first antimicrobial agent successfully used to treat leprosy; subsequently, efficacy was also demonstrated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, its parent compound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. After many years of monotherapy with these agents, drug resistance was observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>In 1981, a World Health Organization (WHO) study group met to consider multidrug therapy for leprosy, mindful of the experience with the development of drug resistance after monotherapy for tuberculosis. In light of the &quot;imperative need for therapeutic regimens,&quot; the group made an empiric recommendation to use the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> for tuberculoid leprosy and to add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clofazimine</a> for lepromatous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of the individual agents had been demonstrated clinically and in mouse studies and was subsequently confirmed in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. No controlled trials comparing drug combination regimens have been done; designing trials for treatment of a noncultivable pathogen is complicated by the lack of an accurate quantitative endpoint. In addition, a very long observation period is required for identification of relapse (approximately 15 to 20 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2779397\" class=\"local\">'Relapse'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21479664\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple drug therapy has important individual as well as public health benefits since it is active against <em>M. leprae</em> and rapidly renders the patient noninfectious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. First-line medications include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, and, for lepromatous disease, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clofazimine</a>. Used in combination, these have proven to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>We are in agreement with the National Hansen's Disease Programs (NHDP) in the United States, which advocates the treatment regimen summarized in the Tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51183\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51183 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64965\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64965 \">table 2</a>). The NHDP favors a longer duration of therapy than the WHO and also advocates daily rather than monthly administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The duration of treatment previously recommended by the WHO in 1982 was 6 to 12 months for tuberculoid disease (TT and BT) and 24 months for lepromatous disease (BB, BL, and LL). Subsequently in 1998, the WHO reduced the recommended duration to 6 months and 12 months, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], in part to reflect cost considerations for resource-limited settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/16,17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,21</a>]. However, shorter treatment regimens have been associated with a greater incidence of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Alternative agents for treatment of leprosy include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a>. Evidence for the efficacy of newer drug combinations or shorter regimens is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Earlier attempts to treat patients with &quot;single lesion paucibacillary disease&quot; with a single-dose combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> (600 mg), ofloxacin (400 mg), and minocycline (100 mg) were based on a multicenter trial in which this regimen demonstrated slightly less clinical improvement compared with the standard WHO paucibacillary (PB) regimen during 18 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/16,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24</a>]. Another report indicated that one month of rifampin plus ofloxacin was insufficient for the treatment of lepromatous (multibacillary [MB]) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Neuritis (pain, burning or tingling, sudden numbness, or loss of function) must be treated aggressively to prevent or minimize nerve injury and subsequent deformity and disability. Neuritis is treated primarily with corticosteroids. Nerve function appears to improve after corticosteroid treatment in 60 to 70 percent of patients, but it may remain impaired in patients with preexisting or recurrent neuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. About one-third of impaired nerves do not improve with corticosteroid treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a controlled trial of treatment for type 1 reactions with three different treatment regimens, the greatest improvement in nerve function occurred in the group receiving higher dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (60 mg) and longer duration (20 weeks or longer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Treatment is best individualized; in some cases, even higher doses and longer duration of prednisone may be required. No long-term benefit has been associated with prophylactic corticosteroid treatment for prevention of neuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H310298161\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of immunologic reactions'</a> below.)</p><p>In the United States, medication for the treatment of leprosy are provided free of charge by the NHDP (1-800-642-2477) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Outside the United States, the WHO distributes medications through the Ministry of Health in each country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H310298033\"><span class=\"h3\">Therapeutic agents</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dapsone</a> &ndash; Dapsone is inexpensive and generally well tolerated in the doses used for the treatment of leprosy. Adverse effects include dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome, methemoglobinemia, and agranulocytosis. Shortened red cell survival is common with dapsone, though severe hemolytic anemia is uncommon except in those with a severe glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; all patients should be screened for G6PD deficiency before receiving dapsone. Because the antibacterial activity of dapsone is inhibited by p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), it is thought that dapsone has a mechanism of action similar to that of the sulfonamides, which involves inhibition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> synthesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of methemoglobinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-neutropenia-and-agranulocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic anemia due to drugs and toxins&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A dose of 100 mg daily is weakly bactericidal against <em>M. leprae</em>, but such a dose exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the organism by a factor of about 500. Such doses even inhibit the multiplication of <em>M. leprae</em> mutants with low to moderate degrees of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> resistance. The maximum dose should be used from the start and should not be reduced during immunologic reactions. Dapsone resistance is generally reported in areas where monotherapy has been used; it is extremely rare in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> &ndash; Rifampin is the most bactericidal drug available for the treatment of leprosy. An estimated 99.999 percent of bacilli are killed with three monthly doses. The standard dose in the United States dose is 600 mg daily but even a single dose of 600 mg monthly, as used in the WHO regimens, is highly bactericidal. Rifampin binds the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex, uncoupling transcription. The target for rifampin is the beta subunit of the RNA polymerase encoded by <em>rpoB61</em>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Toxicity of the drug is relatively low but is related to the size of the dose and the interval between doses. The standard doses for leprosy have proven relatively nontoxic, although occasional cases of renal failure, bone marrow suppression, &quot;flu-like&quot; syndrome, and hepatitis have been reported. Daily administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> has major effects on drug metabolism by the liver cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4), which greatly affects other medications such as oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, and HIV protease inhibitors, among many others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifamycins-rifampin-rifabutin-rifapentine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rifamycins (rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clofazimine</a> &ndash; Clofazimine is well tolerated in the standard dose of 50 mg daily used for leprosy. The major effect seen is pigmentation of the skin (especially within skin lesions), since the drug is lipophilic and accumulates in the lipid-rich cell wall of <em>M. leprae</em>. At higher doses (200 mg daily), hyperpigmentation may be noticeable within four weeks; at lower doses, it may take four to six months. Clofazimine causes phototoxicity, which can accelerate darkening of the skin with sun exposure. This pigmentation usually clears within one to two years after treatment is discontinued. Some patients are reluctant to take clofazimine because of the pigmentation but will usually accept it if the temporary nature of the pigmentation and the benefit of reducing the likelihood of a debilitating treatment reaction are carefully explained. The higher doses of clofazimine (up to 300 mg daily) sometimes used for the control of reactions may occasionally produce severe gastrointestinal side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mechanisms of action of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clofazimine</a> are not known. The drug is weakly bactericidal against <em>M. leprae</em>, but the combination of clofazimine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> is much more active than either drug alone, killing 99.999 percent of bacilli in mouse studies within three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clofazimine</a> is not available in pharmacies in the United States. It is classified by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an investigational drug. Requests for clofazimine to treat leprosy should be directed to the NHDP (an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services), which holds the investigational new drug (IND) protocol for this indication, at 1-800-642-2477 (phone).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Minocycline</a> &ndash; Minocycline is the only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> with significant activity against <em>M. leprae</em>. This may be due to its lipophilic properties, which allow the drug to penetrate cell walls. It is bactericidal for <em>M. leprae</em> to a somewhat greater degree than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> but much less so than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>. Minocycline was very effective when given as monotherapy for two months in a small series of eight lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patients, although monotherapy is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Minocycline inhibits protein synthesis via reversible binding at the 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby blocking the binding of aminoacyl-transfer RNA to the mRNA ribosomal complex. Side effects include discoloration of teeth in children, occasional pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, gastrointestinal complaints, and central nervous system (CNS) toxicity, including dizziness and unsteadiness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macrolides &ndash; Several macrolides have been evaluated for activity against <em>M. leprae</em>; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> is the only effective agent. The drug has potent bactericidal activity but is less bactericidal than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>. At a dose of 500 mg daily in leprosy patients, 99 percent of <em>M. leprae</em> are killed in 28 days and 99.9 percent by 56 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The drug acts by inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by linking to the 50S ribosomal subunit, thereby preventing elongation of the protein chain. Gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are the most common adverse effects, but they do not usually necessitate discontinuation of the drug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluoroquinolones &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ofloxacin</a> has good antibacterial activity and is the most widely accepted fluoroquinolone for treatment of leprosy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. It acts by interfering with bacterial DNA replication by inhibiting the A subunit of the DNA gyrase. A single 400 mg dose has bactericidal activity against <em>M. leprae</em>, although less than that demonstrated by a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, and two doses are capable of killing 99.99 percent of the viable <em>M. leprae</em>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Levofloxacin</a>, the active L-racemer of ofloxacin, has replaced ofloxacin in many United States formularies. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Moxifloxacin</a> is also highly bactericidal against <em>M. leprae</em>; further study of rifampin and moxifloxacin as combination short-term therapy is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ciprofloxacin</a> is not active against <em>M. leprae</em>.

It may take a few years for cutaneous lesions to resolve fully, depending on the initial number of lesions and severity of infection.

Since <em>M. leprae</em> cannot be grown in culture and its viability cannot be assessed in biopsies, a definitive bacteriological endpoint for treatment is not available. The presence of bacilli in smears or biopsies during and after treatment does not, in itself, indicate treatment failure or drug resistance. There is no evidence that prolonged antimicrobial treatment enhances the removal of dead <em>M. leprae</em> from tissues.</p><p>Given the lack of a definitive therapeutic endpoint, assessing compliance is especially important in assessing completeness of treatment. Laboratory evidence indicates that <em>M. leprae</em> are killed rapidly after exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> and the other drugs used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Experience with multidrug therapy has provided good evidence of cure with very few relapses using NHDP or WHO protocols with one to two years of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, if adherence to the well-established multiple drug therapy protocols is good, killing of the bacilli and resolution of the lesions can be expected.</p><p>While on treatment, the first follow-up visit should be done in two to four weeks to evaluate for side effects of medications. After that, routine follow-up visits should be scheduled every three months. Visits should consist of a clinical examination, including assessment of the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes, as well as laboratory studies to assess drug toxicity. Patients should report any new skin lesions, sensory or motor loss, eye symptoms, reactions, or other complaints.</p><p>Disease progression that occurs during therapy is almost always due to poor adherence to treatment. Therefore, patient education is an important part of each visit; compliance with a prolonged drug regimen is unlikely unless the patient fully understands the necessity for it. Cooperation of the family is also important.</p><p>For areas of the hands and feet where sensation has been lost, patients need to be taught to evaluate these areas regularly for evidence of injury and to obtain treatment promptly. Special protective shoes may be needed to avoid injury or ulceration. Motor loss resulting in deformities may require corrective surgery.</p><p>Examination of the eyes should include assessment of lid closure, cornea, and conjunctiva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Complex problems such as iridocyclitis should be managed by a specialist. Corneal anesthesia and lagophthalmos require protective measures and corrective surgery.</p><p>In lepromatous (MB) cases, skin biopsies from the same lesion can be performed at one to two year intervals to assess the response to treatment by evaluating the reduction of inflammation and the decline of bacilli in the tissues. Processing and interpretation of biopsies for this purpose are available from the <a href=\"http://www.hrsa.gov/hansensdisease/diagnosis/biopsy.html&amp;token=zSPtE988RPWwaa5EJN5UO29GuvYbHzlyjh2Ki+CDv1QN7LnaE2wU6ipy/p7UBejyUAml+IwjTpXru4ATeHYysA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16520\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NHDP</a> at no cost.</p><p>Routine laboratory studies to assess drug toxicity while on treatment include a complete blood count, urinalyses, creatinine, and liver function tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76797\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76797 \">table 3</a>). Drug toxicity is relatively uncommon after the first year of treatment, and serious toxicity may manifest clinically before it is detected in the laboratory. Asymptomatic liver enzyme elevation of up to three times normal is acceptable.</p><p>After completion of treatment, annual follow-up for five more years is warranted for tuberculoid (PB) cases and for least 10 more years is warranted for lepromatous (MB) patients. Patients should be advised to return for evaluation if new lesions or other problems develop.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H310298161\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF IMMUNOLOGIC REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunologic reactions are systemic inflammatory complications that occur either before treatment (some patients initially present for medical attention in the setting of a reaction), during treatment, or months to years after treatment has been completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-leprosy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A general feeling of fatigue, malaise, and fever may be present. Other manifestations include neuritis, arthritis, iritis, and nasopharyngeal symptoms. The inflammation associated with reactions can lead to severe nerve injury with subsequent paralysis and deformity. Immunologic reactions are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy#H2780036\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of leprosy&quot;, section on 'Immunologic reactions'</a>.)</p><p>In general, antimicrobial therapy should be continued in the setting of immunologic reactions, and patients should be reassured that the symptoms are not a reaction to the medications. Options for treatment of immunologic reactions include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> with or without other antiinflammatory agents. Use of prednisone should prompt reduction in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> administration from 600 mg daily to 600 mg once monthly. Patients should be monitored carefully for neuropathy or neuritis and treated aggressively if these develop or worsen. Tapering of prednisone and other antiinflammatory agents is empiric, based on clinical response.</p><p>Progression of the infection may occur in cases of noncompliance or drug resistance. Clinically, skin lesions may remain unchanged or may appear to worsen (with erythema and swelling) during the first year of treatment. In the setting of true disease progression, skin biopsies may demonstrate an increase in bacterial load, but this is difficult to document unless the biopsies are taken from adjacent sites of the same lesion. Drug resistance in leprosy is rare; in general, inadequate response to treatment is almost always due to inadequate adherence. Moreover, new lesions are almost always due to immunologic reactions, for which there are no well-established laboratory markers.

Of note, the efficacy of thalidomide in treating type 2 reactions is the only reason it has not been completely banned. Thalidomide is approved for marketing only under a special restricted distribution program approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) called &quot;Risk Evaluation and Management Strategy&quot; (REMS).

During true relapse, the tissue bacterial load generally rises steadily.
