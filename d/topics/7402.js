Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of organs all over the body that make and store cells that fight infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63854\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63854 \">figure 1</a>). These infection-fighting cells are also called &quot;white blood cells.&quot;</p><p>When people have follicular lymphoma, their white blood cells become abnormal and grow out of control. These cells can travel to different parts of the body. Often, the abnormal cells collect in bean-shaped organs called lymph nodes. This causes the lymph nodes to swell.</p><p>Follicular lymphoma usually grows slowly, but it can change to a type of lymphoma that grows quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6557619\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of follicular lymphoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with follicular lymphoma first notice one or more swollen lymph nodes. These swollen nodes are often in the neck, groin, or belly. People can feel them under the skin, but they are usually not painful.</p><p>Other than having swollen lymph nodes, some people do not have any other symptoms for years. But other people can have symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Night sweats that soak their clothes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blockages in the digestive tract or urinary tract</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired and weak</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6557626\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for follicular lymphoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam. He or she will also do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph node biopsy &ndash; A doctor will remove one of the swollen lymph nodes. Then another doctor will look at the cells under a microscope to see if cancer cells are present.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6557633\"><span class=\"h1\">What is lymphoma staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphoma staging is a way in which doctors find out how far the lymphoma has spread in the lymphatic system or in the rest of the body.</p><p>To find out how far your follicular lymphoma has spread, your doctor will do an exam, blood tests, and an imaging test, such as a CT or PET scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>Your doctor might also do a bone marrow biopsy. For this test, a doctor will take a small sample of bone marrow (the tissue in the center of your bones). Another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope to see if it has cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6557640\"><span class=\"h1\">How is follicular lymphoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often, follicular lymphoma is not treated right away. Your doctor might not treat your follicular lymphoma right away if it is not causing any symptoms. But he or she will watch your cancer closely by doing exams and blood tests until treatment is needed.</p><p>Doctors usually treat follicular lymphoma when it causes symptoms. Treatments can help reduce symptoms, but they do not usually cure the cancer. The right treatment for you will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where the follicular lymphoma is in your body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your age and other medical conditions</p><p/><p>People with follicular lymphoma can be treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;immunotherapy&quot; &ndash; These medicines kill cancer cells by recognizing the cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow transplant (also called &quot;stem cell transplant&quot;) &ndash; This treatment replaces cells in the bone marrow that are killed by chemotherapy or radiation. Usually, only people whose follicular lymphoma comes back after treatment get a bone marrow transplant.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6557647\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for follicular lymphoma involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have and when.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What will happen if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6557654\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lymphoma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=follicular-lymphoma-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Follicular lymphoma in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
