Radiographic imaging typically reveals bilateral symmetric alveolar opacities located centrally in mid and lower lung zones, often in a &quot;bat wing&quot; distribution. Three forms of PAP are recognized: primary (autoimmune, receptor variants), secondary <span class=\"nowrap\">(hematologic/immunologic</span> disease, inhalational exposures, metabolic), and congenital (surfactant production disorders) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77313\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77313 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>The treatment and prognosis of PAP will be reviewed here. General approaches to adult and pediatric interstitial lung disease and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in adults are described separately.

Pulmonary function tests, including lung volumes, diffusing capacity, and six-minute walk, are used to assess the degree of impairment and to provide a baseline for long-term monitoring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary function tests'</a>.)</p><p>Serial measurements of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or serum antibodies to GM-CSF may prove useful in monitoring disease activity and response to treatment in autoimmune PAP, although further study of this approach is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In one study, BAL fluid levels of anti-GM-CSF antibodies correlated better with the severity of PAP compared to serum titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF AUTOIMMUNE PAP</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of treatment options for autoimmune PAP depends upon the severity of disease. This approach is based on observations about the natural history of the disease that show a high rate of spontaneous remission among those with mild disease. In the largest series, for example, asymptomatic patients were most likely to have a stable to improving course with only 8 percent worsening during follow up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among symptomatic patients, the proportions with stable, improved, and worsening disease were about 45, 30, and 25 percent, respectively. Patients with longer disease duration were more likely to have progressive disease.</p><p>In order to obtain the best risk benefit balance when choosing therapy, we divide patients into the following categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic or mild symptoms (eg, dyspnea with moderate or greater exertion) with little or no physiologic impairment (eg, normal to mildly reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO], normal pulse oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] at rest with or without a mild decrease on exertion)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate-to-severe symptoms (eg, dyspnea with minimal exertion or at rest) and physiologic abnormalities (eg, requiring supplemental oxygen at rest)</p><p/><p>During the course of treatment or observation, symptoms (eg, dyspnea, exercise tolerance), spirometry, diffusing capacity, ambulatory oximetry, and chest computed tomography (CT) scan are monitored to assess the response to therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1844199350\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with PAP should be counselled to obtain annual vaccination against influenza and age-appropriate vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia.

Aside from the general health benefits, smoking cessation may have benefits for PAP. As an example, among patients who undergo whole lung lavage, those who smoke cigarettes require twice as many sessions of whole lung lavage as nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Supplemental oxygen is provided according to current guidelines.

In a series of 120 patients with autoimmune PAP, 40 were managed without therapeutic intervention for PAP. Of these, 39 remained stable or achieved remission, while one died of a pulmonary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1587336380\"><span class=\"h2\">Moderate-to-severe respiratory impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have moderate to severe disease based on symptoms and physiologic testing may elect to proceed with whole lung lavage or a trial of experimental treatment (eg, subcutaneous or inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>). A stepwise treatment approach has been suggested, beginning with whole lung lavage for patients with moderate to severe symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. If there is progression of disease or whole lung lavage is intolerable, inhaled GM-CSF can be given. Some patients may respond better to whole lung lavage followed by inhaled GM-CSF treatment, than to initial treatment with inhaled GM-CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. If there is inadequate response to whole lung lavage and GM-CSF or they are associated with unacceptable side effects, then rituximab may be tried.

It is typically performed under general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A double-lumen endotracheal tube is inserted with the patient supine and the correct positioning of the tips in the trachea (lavage lung) and main bronchus (ventilated lung) confirmed by flexible bronchoscopy. The patient is placed in the lateral recumbent position with the lung to be lavaged nondependent. The dependent lung is ventilated and oxygenated using one lung ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-isolation-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung isolation techniques&quot;</a>.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A 15 to 20 L bag of normal saline is hung from an intravenous (IV) pole, and the fluid is warmed to 37&ordm;C by passing through a blood warmer. The lavage is performed by instilling 0.8 to 1.5 L aliquots of warmed normal saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. During each instillation, the patient is slanted to elevate the head slightly (lateral reverse Trendelenburg). After instillation of the lavage fluid, chest percussion is performed for four to five minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], followed by positioning the patient is slanted with the head down (lateral Trendelenburg head down position) for gravity drainage of the fluid through the endotracheal tube into a collection canister. A flexible bronchoscope is used, as needed, to inspect the lung and suction residual fluid. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Careful count of the volumes instilled and recovered is needed to avoid overdistension of the lung with unrecovered fluid; not more than 200 to 300 mL should accumulate in the lungs unrecovered. While practice varies, the total volume of lavage fluid approximates 15 L, spread over 10 to 15 lavages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82575\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82575 \">picture 1</a>). The initial lavage effluent appears thick and milky, while the final lavage appears clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For the majority of patients, unilateral lung lavage is performed on the first day followed by lavage of the opposite lung one to two weeks later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, bilateral sequential WLL has been performed in a single treatment session. Because one lung is ventilated while the other undergoes lavage, it seems logical to first perform lavage on the side that is worse while ventilating the less affected lung to minimize desaturation during the procedure. For patients with severely compromised gas exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been used to support the patient during WLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Meticulous charting and monitoring of oxygenation, dynamic lung compliance, correct position of the double-lumen endotracheal tube, and recovery of the infused saline are necessary to avoid and to quickly diagnose complications. After the procedure, an upright chest radiograph is obtained to exclude pneumothorax. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Complications of WLL include malpositioning of the endotracheal tube, saline spillover into the opposite ventilated lung, intraprocedural hypoxemia, pneumothorax, and hydropneumothorax.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> &ndash; After WLL, patients often feel dramatically better, with substantial improvement in exertional dyspnea and oxygenation despite only small changes in pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The subsequent clinical course is variable. Thirty to 50 percent of patients require only one lavage, while others require repeat lung lavages at intervals of 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/10,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15,16</a>]. Of note, cigarette smokers are more likely to require repeat WLL than nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a series of 80 patients with autoimmune PAP who required WLL, 56 (70 percent) achieved a sustained remission with one lavage, while 24 required one or more additional treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of those who required additional treatments, 19 remained stable or improved and 5 developed refractory disease.

Compared with the initial observation period, gas exchange improved in 24 patients over the 24 weeks of inhalation therapy.

Of 14 patients who required supplemental oxygen prior to the study, 8 no longer required oxygen after treatment. Initial levels of anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies were not different between responders and nonresponders. No serious adverse effects were reported. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a follow-up study, GM-CSF inhalation was associated with a decrease in anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from improved patients, but not in the serum, suggesting that GM-CSF inhalation does not affect autoantibody production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a separate series, 19 patients received varying schedules of recombinant GM-CSF by inhalation for 12 to 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].
