The majority are found incidentally in patients undergoing exploration for cholelithiasis; a tumor will be found in 1 to 2 percent of such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The poor prognosis associated with GBC is thought to be related to advanced stage at diagnosis, which is due both to the anatomic position of the gallbladder, and the vagueness and nonspecificity of symptoms.</p><p>Here we will discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnostic evaluation of GBC. Treatment of localized, potentially resectable GBC and treatment for advanced disease are covered separately, as is cholangiocarcinoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant treatment for localized, resected gallbladder cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of advanced, unresectable gallbladder cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and classification of cholangiocarcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worldwide, there is prominent geographic variability in GBC incidence that correlates with the prevalence of cholelithiasis. High rates of GBC are seen in South American countries, particularly Chile, Bolivia, and Ecuador, as well as some areas of India, Pakistan, Japan, and Korea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In Chile, mortality rates from GBC are the highest in the world. These populations all share a high prevalence of gallstones <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> salmonella infection, both recognized risk factors for GBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Both genetic factors and socioeconomic issues that delay or prevent access to cholecystectomy for gallstones are thought to be contributory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>North America is considered a low-incidence area. In the United States, GBC is the most common cancer arising in the biliary tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Estimates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database reveal an incidence of 1 to 2 cases per 100,000 population in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although the available data support a decreased overall incidence of GBC in the United States over the last 30 years, the incidence may be increasing in younger individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In contrast to the general population, GBC is the most common gastrointestinal malignancy in both Southwestern Native Americans and in Mexican Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In addition to geography, there are also age, race, and gender-related differences in the incidence of GBC. Incidence steadily increases with age, women are affected two to six times more often than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], and GBC is more common in Caucasians than in black people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several risk factors have been identified for GBC, many of which share a common characteristic of chronic gallbladder inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,14,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,18-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gallstone disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gallstones are present in 70 to 90 percent of patients with GBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>], and a history of gallstones appears to be one of the strongest risk factors for the development of GBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,19,20,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19,20,22-24</a>]. As an example, in a case-control study from Shanghai that included 368 patients with GBC and 959 healthy controls, individuals with symptomatic gallbladder disease (gallstones or self-reported cholecystitis) were 34-fold more likely to develop GBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Despite the increased risk of GBC in patients with gallstones, the overall incidence of GBC in patients with cholelithiasis is only 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The risk is higher with larger gallstones (in one study, patients with stones larger than 3 cm had a 10-fold higher risk of GBC compared with those with stones &lt;1 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]) and longer duration of cholelithiasis (particularly over the age of 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]).

It is associated with cholelithiasis in more than 95 percent of cases. As with other gallstone-related conditions, these patients are at increased risk of GBC. The reported incidence of GBC in patients with a porcelain gallbladder ranges from 0 to 60 percent, with more recent studies suggesting a rate of approximately 2 to 3 percent. The increased risk may be confined to patients with selective mucosal calcification or incomplete mural calcification. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porcelain-gallbladder#H811219132\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porcelain gallbladder&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Gallbladder polyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gallbladder polyps are outgrowths of the gallbladder mucosal wall that are usually found incidentally on ultrasonography or after cholecystectomy. They are classified as benign or malignant, and benign lesions are further classified as nonneoplastic (eg, cholesterol and inflammatory polyps, adenomyomas) or neoplastic (eg, adenomas, leiomyomas) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56347 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The most common benign neoplastic lesion is adenoma, a glandular tumor composed of cells resembling biliary tract epithelium. It is unclear whether adenomatous polyps represent a premalignant lesion and, if so, with which frequency they progress to carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Unlike GBC, gallbladder polyps tend not to occur in patients with cholelithiasis, chronic inflammation is generally absent, and cancer-related molecular changes that are seen in GBCs have not been identified in adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Nevertheless, larger polyps are more likely to contain foci of invasive cancer, and some studies suggest a correlation between the presence of gallbladder polyps and the risk of GBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In a study of 286 patients, 6 percent of cases were found to have gallbladder masses, of which 56 percent were GBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Therefore, an annual screening ultrasound of the gallbladder is recommended in these patients.

Because chronic carriage occurs more often in individuals with cholelithiasis, gallstones are thought to represent a potential nidus for ongoing infection.

The strength of this association requires further clarification.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital biliary cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary cysts are cystic dilatations that may occur singly or in multiples throughout the bile ducts. They were originally termed choledochal cysts (involving the extrahepatic bile duct), but the clinical classification was revised in 1977 to include intrahepatic cysts. Biliary cysts may be congenital or acquired, and they are associated with a variety of anatomic abnormalities. An anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction is present in approximately 70 percent of patients with biliary cysts (see below). Like anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction, biliary cysts are especially frequent in Asian populations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-cysts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary cysts&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Biliary cysts are associated with an increased risk of cancer, particularly cholangiocarcinoma. The incidence of malignancy varies with age. In a 1983 review of all published series of biliary cysts, the incidence of cancer was 0.7 percent in patients under 10 years of age, 6.8 percent in patients 11 to 20 years of age, and 14.3 percent in patients over 20 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. An incidence as high as 50 percent has been reported in older patients. At least one study suggests that the increased incidence of carcinoma in biliary cysts is confined to patients with an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

This condition may represent failure of the embryological ducts to migrate fully into the duodenum. This condition is most prevalent in Asians populations, mostly Japanese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>].</p><p>The long common channel may predispose to reflux of pancreatic juice into the biliary tree since the ductal junction lies outside of the sphincter of Oddi. Elevated sphincter of Oddi pressures have been documented in anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction and could also promote pancreaticobiliary reflux. The result is increased amylase levels in bile, intraductal activation of proteolytic enzymes, alterations in bile composition, and presumed biliary epithelial damage, inflammation, ductal distension, and cyst formation.</p><p>Anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction appears to increase the risk of biliary and pancreatic malignancy even in patients without a biliary cyst or ductal dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>]. GBC is the most common malignancy seen in patients with an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction and no bile duct cysts. As a result, prophylactic cholecystectomy is recommended in affected patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-cysts#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary cysts&quot;, section on 'Abnormal pancreatobiliary junction'</a>.)</p><p>The molecular pathogenesis of GBC arising in patients with an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction appears to be different from that underlying the development of GBC in the setting of gallstone disease.

Incident cases of biliary tract cancer were ascertained through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register. With a mean follow-up of over 13 years, after adjustment for other risk factors, women and men in the highest category of combined sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened beverage consumption had a significantly higher risk of GBC (multivariable hazard ratio for two or more 200 mL servings per day of sweetened beverages compared with no consumption was 2.24, 95% CI 1.02-4.89).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differences in the demographics, clinical presentation, and gender distribution suggest that there are two key pathways to developing GBC in patients with cholelithiasis and an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction. The main mechanism involves cholelithiasis and resultant cholecystitis and seems to be the driving force in most regions of the world where GBC is strongly associated with gallstone disease, female gender bias, and age over 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>It is hypothesized that chronic irritation of the gallbladder mucosa over a period of years may predispose to malignant transformation or act as a promoter for carcinogenic exposure or genetic predisposition. In keeping with this hypothesis, bile samples from patients in endemic areas are more mutagenic than those from patients from low-incidence areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Despite these data, there is no conclusive evidence linking bile composition to GBC.</p><p>A second mechanism involves anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction, which is associated with a relatively high proportion of cases of GBC in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Cancers associated with this condition occur at a younger age, show less female gender bias, and have a lower incidence of associated cholelithiasis.</p><p>There are also histologic and molecular differences in GBCs associated with anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction and in those associated with gallstones, providing further evidence that two distinct pathogenetic pathways are involved (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. GBCs arising in Japan in the setting of an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction are characterized by <em>KRAS</em> mutations and relatively late onset of p53 mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/70-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-73</a>]. By contrast, at least in Chilean patients with cholelithiasis and chronic cholecystitis, <em>KRAS</em> mutations are rare, while p53 mutations arise early during multistage pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. </p><p>Most epithelial cancers are preceded by a series of histologic and molecular changes that evolve over a period of several years or decades. The paradigm in which stepwise accumulation of specific molecular abnormalities characterizes the evolution from premalignant change to invasive cancer is best established in colorectal cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similar to other gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas, adenocarcinomas involving the gallbladder progress from dysplasia to carcinoma in situ, and then to invasive cancer. The molecular changes that characterize these sequential changes are less well characterized than those in colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In contrast to colorectal cancer, gallbladder adenomas are rarely found in the context of dysplastic changes; a <span class=\"nowrap\">metaplasia-dysplasia/carcinoma</span> in <span class=\"nowrap\">situ/invasive</span> carcinoma sequence seems far more prevalent than an <span class=\"nowrap\">adenoma/carcinoma</span> sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Further, incidentally identified gallbladder adenomas uncommonly harbor cancerous changes and seem to represent an entity with only a small clinical risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-polyps-and-cholesterolosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder polyps and cholesterolosis&quot;, section on 'Adenomas'</a>.)</p><p>There are molecular differences between dysplastic lesions and adenomas that may account for underlying biologic differences. Mutations in catenin beta 1 (<em>CTNNB1</em>) are frequent in adenomas but rare in <span class=\"nowrap\">dysplastic/carcinoma</span> lesions. As noted above, <em>KRAS</em> mutations have been identified in dysplastic and hyperplastic lesions associated with anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction; this anatomic variant is associated with a significant risk for carcinoma, and these tumors consistently demonstrate <em>KRAS</em> mutations. The reciprocal relationship between <em>CTNNB1</em> and <em>KRAS</em> mutations among adenomas and <span class=\"nowrap\">dysplasia/carcinomas,</span> the frequent association of dysplasia with invasive carcinoma, and the less common finding of adenoma in cancer specimens all suggest that gallbladder adenomas represent a distinct biologic process with a relatively low malignant potential, while <em>KRAS</em>-mutated dysplastic lesions have a high malignant potential.</p><p>Dysplastic changes can be found in the mucosa adjacent to over 90 percent of GBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>], and they are relatively frequent in routine cholecystectomy specimens. The entire sequence appears to take approximately 15 years. Symptomatic cholecystitis seldom appears before the age of 40; the median age for detecting dysplasia is 45 years of age, and for carcinoma in situ, it is 55 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Squamous metaplasia is a rare premalignant lesion found in association with invasive squamous cell GBC.</p><p>By contrast, in both adults and children with an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction, epithelial hyperplasia with a papillary or villous appearance is present in 39 to 61 percent of cases and is thought to represent a premalignant histologic change in the gallbladder mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/69,79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,79,80</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer#H741641\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of gallbladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical scenarios'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with early invasive GBC are most often asymptomatic, or they have nonspecific symptoms that mimic or are due to cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. Before ultrasonography and CT became widely available, the preoperative diagnosis rate for GBC was only 10 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. However, with an appropriate index of suspicion and better imaging techniques, a preoperative diagnosis may be reached in 75 to 88 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Early tumors as small as 5 mm can be recognized as polypoid masses projecting into the gallbladder lumen or as a focal thickening of the gallbladder wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,83</a>]. Even so, only approximately 50 percent of GBCs are recognized before operation in contemporary series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,84</a>].</p><p>Among symptomatic patients, the most common complaint is pain, followed by anorexia, nausea, or vomiting. The symptoms of advanced GBC often differ from usual biliary colic and are more suggestive of malignant disease (eg, malaise, weight loss). Patients who present with a symptom complex suggestive of acute cholecystitis more often have earlier stage disease and a better long-term outcome than those who present otherwise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Patients with GBC may also present with obstructive jaundice, either from direct invasion of the biliary tree or from metastatic disease to the region of the hepatoduodenal ligament. This diagnosis should be particularly suspected if a compression of the common hepatic duct by an impacted stone in the gallbladder neck is identified (ie, Mirizzi syndrome). Invasion of tumor into the porta hepatis may also result in duodenal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The presence of duodenal obstruction implies unresectability.

Courvoisier's sign or Courvoisier's Law was originally proposed to be a sign of malignancy (pancreatic, gallbladder) rather than cholelithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. However, because there are exceptions to this rule (eg, chronic pancreatitis, parasitic biliary obstruction, congenital choledochal cyst, common hepatic duct obstruction proximal to the takeoff of the cystic duct) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>], the diagnostic utility of this historical sign is limited.

The overall accuracy of ultrasonography (US) for staging the local and distant extent of a suspected GBC is limited. Additional imaging (typically cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">[MRI]/magnetic</span> resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]) is needed for patients who have concerning findings on US (calcification, a mass protruding into the lumen, loss of interface between gallbladder and liver, direct liver infiltration, gallbladder polyps &ge;10 mm, or a thickened gallbladder wall that is not explained by cholecystitis). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H996453276\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual initial diagnostic study for presumed-benign gallstone-related disease is US.

Findings that are suggestive but not diagnostic of GBC include mural thickening or calcification, a mass protruding into the lumen, a fixed mass in the gallbladder, loss of the interface between the gallbladder and liver, or direct liver infiltration.</p><p>Small polypoid lesions within the gallbladder may represent adenomas, papillomas, cholesterolosis, or carcinomas. Polyps over 1 cm in diameter are more likely to contain an invasive cancer than smaller ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/83,87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,87,88</a>].

Thus, cholecystectomy should be strongly considered for patients with gallbladder polyps &gt;1 cm. Although fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy may be useful to distinguish cholesterolosis from GBC, the distinction between adenoma and GBC is less accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

For those with incidentally diagnosed GBC following cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis, appropriate imaging and detailed histopathologic analysis of the cholecystectomy specimen are needed to decide whether further resection is necessary. For those with locally advanced GBC, dynamic cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) should include arterial phase images to determine the anatomic course of the hepatic arteries relative to the tumor, which is necessary to determine resectability.</p><p>On CT, GBC can appear as a polypoid mass protruding into the lumen or completely filling it, a focal or diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall, or a mass in the gallbladder fossa with the gallbladder itself being indiscernible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]; liver invasion, suspected nodal involvement, or distant metastases may be shown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. Features suggesting GBC complicated by cholecystitis rather than simple cholecystitis include a higher frequency of lymph node enlargement, more-extensive wall thickness, focal irregularity in wall thickness, and less distention of the gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. </p><p>CT is less helpful in distinguishing benign from malignant polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. In contrast, dynamic MRI and MRCP can help to differentiate benign from malignant gallbladder lesions in equivocal cases and provide information as to disease extent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/97-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-99</a>].

In this multicenter report of 252 patients with resected T2 GBC, five-year survival rates for tumors on the peritoneal and hepatic side were 65 versus 43 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The N classification has changed from a location-based to a number-based assessment. N1 is one to three positive nodes, while N2 disease is four or more positive nodes. There is also a recommendation that six or more nodes be harvested and evaluated. This change was based upon studies that demonstrated that the number of metastatic lymph nodes and the lymph node ratio are more prognostic than the location of the metastatic lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/124-127\" class=\"abstract_t\">124-127</a>]. The regional nodes include those along the common bile duct, hepatic artery, portal vein, and cystic duct. Nodes that are beyond the hepatoduodenal ligament (including periaortic, pericaval, superior mesenteric artery, and celiac artery lymph nodes) are extraregional and staged as distant metastases (M1 disease). </p><p/><p>These changes in the classification of GBC have improved the prognostic stratification of the staging system. Observed survival rates from a multicenter series of 437 cases of GBC stratified according to stage grouping are depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110891\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110891 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Stage distribution at presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary T stage distribution (as defined by the 2010 seventh edition classification) in a contemporary series of 439 cases of incidentally found GBC from a German registry stratified according to the type of surgical procedure is illustrated in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71493 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].

Worldwide, there is prominent geographic variability in GBC incidence that correlates with the prevalence of cholelithiasis. Incidence steadily increases with age, women are affected two to six times more often than men, and GBC is more common in Caucasians than in black people. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority (close to 90 percent) are adenocarcinomas, although other histologic types are occasionally found, including adenosquamous or squamous cell carcinoma, small cell neuroendocrine tumors, lymphoma, and sarcoma. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Histology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several risk factors have been identified, many of which share a common characteristic of chronic gallbladder inflammation: gallstone disease, gallbladder polyps and congenital biliary cysts, anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction, and chronic infection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar to other gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas, adenocarcinomas involving the gallbladder progress from dysplasia to carcinoma in situ, and then to invasive cancer. The molecular changes that characterize these sequential changes are less well characterized than those in colorectal cancer. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with early invasive GBC are most often asymptomatic, or they have nonspecific symptoms that mimic or are due to cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. Malignancy diagnosed incidentally on pathologic examination after a simple cholecystectomy is the most common mode of presentation of early stage disease. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since many patients are diagnosed intraoperatively at the time of cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis, an important issue is the screening of patients with symptomatic biliary tract disease for the possibility of coexisting GBC. Ultrasound (US) is typically the initial study; however, the overall accuracy of US for staging the local and distant extent of suspected GBC is limited. (See <a href=\"#H1784919310\" class=\"local\">'Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional imaging (typically cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">[MRI]/magnetic</span> resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]) is needed for patients who have concerning findings on US (calcification, a mass protruding into the lumen, loss of interface between gallbladder and liver, direct liver infiltration, gallbladder polyps &ge;10 mm, or a thickened gallbladder wall that is not explained by cholecystitis). In this setting, evaluation of potential resectability is the key factor. Cross-sectional imaging is also recommended for patients who are found to have an incidentally diagnosed GBC at the time of simple cholecystectomy. For those with incidentally diagnosed GBC, appropriate imaging and detailed histopathologic analysis are needed to decide whether further resection is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H4161859005\" class=\"local\">'Suspicious US findings or incidental GBC at cholecystectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On CT scan, GBC can appear as a polypoid mass protruding into the lumen or completely filling it, a focal or diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall, or a mass in the gallbladder fossa with the gallbladder itself being indiscernible. Dynamic MRI and MRCP can help to differentiate benign from malignant gallbladder lesions in equivocal cases and provide information as to disease extent. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'CT and MRI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholangiography is of little use for patients suspected of having GBC since the gallbladder is not observed in most cases, except in situations in which GBC cancer is suspected in the setting of jaundice. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Cholangiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To complete the staging evaluation, consensus-based guidelines from the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=Uq9WYRsg9p/PSM9vt3rBGtHa7uSejixwk2tJVlS5LMeu0awaX/Er3fekhDozpt3zew+Yt0LRtO7qp5BoCEEM5YoFu3K3VNa+mIo9yk7LJGM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2491\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>] recommend cross-sectional imaging of the chest in patients who appear otherwise to be potential candidates for resection. The available data are insufficient to make conclusive statements about the clinical utility of positron emission tomography (PET) or integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> in the management of patients with GBC. (See <a href=\"#H84340903\" class=\"local\">'Completing the staging evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies are generally nondiagnostic; an elevated alkaline phosphatase or serum bilirubin may be related to bile duct obstruction. Serum tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9, also called cancer antigen 19-9) are often elevated but are not diagnostically useful because they lack specificity and sensitivity. Nevertheless, if a tumor marker is found to be elevated preoperatively, serial assay after resection might aid in the diagnosis of persistent or recurrent disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several staging systems have been used for GBC. Although the staging system developed by Nevin is still used, particularly in Europe, the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the combined American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) is the preferred classification scheme in both Europe and the United States.
