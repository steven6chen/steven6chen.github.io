It is of considerable use in assessing patients&rsquo; coronary artery disease risk. However, low levels of HDL cholesterol have not been established as causative of this increase in risk. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Low HDL cholesterol as a CVD risk factor'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Effect of increasing HDL cholesterol on clinical outcome'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will address clinical aspects of abnormal HDL (the particle) and HDL cholesterol.

In clinical practice, HDL cholesterol, rather than HDL, is used to risk stratify patients.

Based on data from the Framingham Heart Study, the risk for myocardial infarction increases by about 25 percent for every 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> decrement in serum HDL cholesterol below median values for men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most of these studies have found that, after adjustment for other known risk factors, a low level of HDL cholesterol is an independent predictor of risk. This does not mean, however, that it is causative of CHD. (See <a href=\"#H1993214513\" class=\"local\">'Low HDL cholesterol as a cause of CVD events'</a> below.)</p><p>HDL cholesterol levels are predictive of coronary events in <strong>patients with known CHD</strong> across a broad range of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. As an example, a post hoc analysis of 2193 individuals with stable disease who participated in the COURAGE trial of optimal medical therapy found that the rate of all-cause death or myocardial infarction was 33 percent lower in the highest compared with the lowest HDL cholesterol quartile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

For example, in a prospective cohort study of 6111 patients with CVD (SMART study) treated with intensive lipid lowering (n = 2046), HDL cholesterol was not associated with recurrent vascular events irrespective of LDL cholesterol level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, in those treated with no or usual-dose lipid-lowering medication, low HDL cholesterol levels were related to increased risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease#H21057273\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, risk factors, and natural history of peripheral artery disease&quot;, section on 'Metabolic syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Low levels are common in patients with premature CHD (usually defined as men less than 55 to 60 years of age and women less than 65 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>]. Low HDL-cholesterol levels are more common in patients with a first myocardial infarction than in age-matched controls without CHD (19 versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The risk associated with low HDL cholesterol is independent of the risk attributed to elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol in most analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Since low HDL cholesterol levels are most often associated with increased concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins (eg, LDL particles), many studies that assess cardiovascular risk in low HDL cholesterol patients have adjusted for LDL particle concentration. Multiple studies have shown that the risk of a low HDL cholesterol diminishes after adjustment for LDL particle concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>Not all disorders associated with low HDL cholesterol are accompanied by a predisposition to premature atherosclerotic CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Examples in which there is not a strong association with atherosclerosis include most patients with lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], and patients with the apolipoprotein A-1 Milano variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. A familial history of premature CHD is often helpful in distinguishing high- from low-risk patients with low HDL cholesterol levels.</p><p>As mentioned above, most studies have suggested that low HDL cholesterol is an independent risk factor for CHD in multivariate analyses. However, a few studies challenge this view. In the Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team (CANHEART) Study, an observational cohort of 631,762 individuals, low HDL cholesterol levels were associated with unhealthy lifestyles, higher triglyceride levels, other cardiac risk factors and medical comorbidities, and lower incomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These associations between low HDL cholesterol and socio-demographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and mortality suggest that HDL cholesterol is a marker of overall CVD risk. The authors of the paper concluded that HDL cholesterol was not an independent risk factor when a series of associated conditions that have previously not been included in multivariate analyses were incorporated.</p><p>Low HDL cholesterol is also felt to be a precursor of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, sometimes by many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

The following two studies are representative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of the Framingham Offspring Cohort (3590 men and women without known CVD) investigated the risk of CVD associated with low or high HDL cholesterol phenotypes (&lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in men and &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in women) that were stratified by LDL cholesterol levels &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> versus &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> versus LDL cholesterol levels and stratified by triglycerides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. When compared with an isolated low HDL cholesterol (&lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in men, &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in women), a high HDL cholesterol was associated with a 20 to 40 percent lower CVD risk. The risks associated with HDL cholesterol varied by the LDL cholesterol and triglyceride level. When compared with isolated low HDL cholesterol, CVD risks were increased when the low HDL cholesterol was accompanied by LDL cholesterol &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and triglycerides &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (odds ratio [OR] 1.3 [1, 1.6]), triglycerides &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and LDL cholesterol &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (OR 1.3 [1.1, 1.5]) or LDL cholesterol and triglycerides &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (OR 1.6 [1.2, 2.2]), after covariate adjustment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an observational study which compared 158 individuals with isolated low HDL cholesterol with 780 individuals with an HDL cholesterol &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in men or &ge;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in women, and triglycerides and LDL cholesterol &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> the risk of cardiovascular events was significantly increased (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.93, 95% CI 1.11-3.34) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The absence of very early coronary heart disease (CHD) in individuals with rare disorders such as Tangier disease, who have very low levels of HDL cholesterol but not the predicted increase cardiovascular disease (CVD), provides some further support for the lack of association. (See <a href=\"#H3415187079\" class=\"local\">'Inherited causes'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional evidence that may explain why low HDL cholesterol has not been shown to be causal comes from the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In this study, the associations between HDL cholesterol and HDL particle number determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with carotid intima-medial thickness (a known predictor of cardiovascular risk) and coronary events (such as myocardial infarction, CHD death, and angina) were evaluated in a group of nearly 6000 individuals without known CHD who were not taking lipid-lowering medication. After adjusting for each other (HDL cholesterol or HDL particle) and for other known predictors of CHD events such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle number, age, sex, hypertension, and smoking, a significant inverse relationship between HDL particle, but not HDL cholesterol, and CHD risk (as measured by carotid thickness and CHD events) persisted. This study adds to the concept that the inverse relationship between HDL cholesterol and cardiovascular event risk may be determined more by some structural or functional component of the HDL particle than by its cholesterol content.</p><p>Finally, interventions to raise HDL cholesterol (as the only therapeutic target) have not uniformly demonstrated benefit, thus making it difficult to prove causality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H822243387\"><span class=\"h1\">HDL PARTICLES AND CVD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is a heterogeneous and complex particle (size, charge, chemical composition, and functionality), it may be that components or properties other than cholesterol concentration are responsible (causative) for the observed inverse relationship between HDL cholesterol and clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

It is possible that one or more of the characteristics of the HDL particle influence the development of atherosclerosis. The genetic determinants of these components or functions may or may not be linked to the HDL cholesterol composition. As an example, two polymorphisms in phospholipid transfer protein are associated with increased concentrations of smaller, cholesterol-depleted HDL particles and a lower cardiovascular event rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The primary endpoint was atherosclerotic CVD, defined as a first nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization or death from cardiovascular causes. After a median follow-up period of 9.4 years, there was a strong inverse relationship between cholesterol efflux capacity and the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.55) comparing the highest quartile with the lowest. Baseline HDL cholesterol was not associated with cardiovascular events in this study.</p><p>We believe this study helps to explain the limitations of using HDL cholesterol for risk prediction.
