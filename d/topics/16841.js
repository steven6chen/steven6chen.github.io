All the vaccines are given together in 1 shot.</p><p>All 3 of these diseases can be serious and even deadly. Diphtheria can cause a thick covering in the back of the throat that can lead to breathing problems. Tetanus is a serious infection that causes muscle stiffness and spasms. Pertussis can cause a severe cough. Another name for pertussis is &quot;whooping cough.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81091516\"><span class=\"h1\">Why should I get the Tdap vaccine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Tdap vaccine can help keep you from getting diphtheria, tetanus, or whooping cough. If you do get sick, being vaccinated can keep you from getting severely ill. Being vaccinated also helps keep people around you from getting sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81091533\"><span class=\"h1\">Who should get the Tdap vaccine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following people should get a Tdap vaccine:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children age 7 to 18</strong> &ndash; Doctors recommend a Tdap vaccine as a &quot;booster.&quot; This is given to children who got diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough vaccines usually given before age 7 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73404 \">table 1</a>). A booster is a vaccine dose given a number of years after the first dose. It reminds the body how to prevent infection. Boosters are important because some vaccines, including shots given to young children for diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough, stop working well over time. If your child missed the earlier vaccine, he or she can get a Tdap vaccine whenever your doctor recommends it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adults age 19 and older</strong> who have never had a Tdap vaccine &ndash; This vaccine is especially important for adults age 65 and older who spend time with children younger than 1. These adults include grandparents, childcare workers, doctors, nurses, and other health care workers.</p><p/><p>If you don't know if you have had a Tdap vaccine, your doctor will probably give you one. This vaccine is important to protect you and other people, especially babies. Whooping cough can be very serious for babies and even cause death.</p><p>After getting the Tdap vaccine, adults should get vaccines against diphtheria and tetanus every 10 years. These are also given together in 1 shot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81091573\"><span class=\"h1\">What side effects can the Tdap vaccine cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Tdap vaccine might not cause any side effects. If it does, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness, swelling, or soreness where the shot was given</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tiredness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p>Like all vaccines, the Tdap vaccine sometimes causes more serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions. But serious side effects are rare. If you ever had a severe allergic reaction to latex, tell your doctor or nurse. Some Tdap vaccines contain latex, but others do not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81091590\"><span class=\"h1\">Should pregnant women get the Tdap vaccine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The Tdap vaccine is safe to use in pregnancy and <strong>all</strong> pregnant women should get it after 20 weeks of pregnancy, even if they have had the Tdap vaccine or the pertussis vaccine before.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81091607\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tetanus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines and pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=whooping-cough-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Whooping cough (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=why-does-my-child-need-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines?
