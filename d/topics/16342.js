According to the World Health Organization classification, B cell CLL is considered to be identical (ie, one disease with different manifestations) to the mature (peripheral) B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes, which are usually monoclonal in origin.</p><p>The staging and prognosis of CLL will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of B cell CLL, including hematopoietic cell transplantation, are discussed separately on the appropriate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of small lymphocytic lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There had been a general belief that CLL is an indolent disease associated with a prolonged (ie, 10 to 20 years) clinical course, and that the eventual cause of death may be unrelated to CLL. However, this observation is true for less than 30 percent of all CLL cases. Some patients die rapidly, within two to three years from diagnosis, from complications or causes directly related to CLL. Other patients live for 5 to 10 years with an initial course that is relatively benign followed by a terminal phase lasting one to two years. During this terminal phase there is considerable morbidity, both from the disease itself and from complications of therapy. The biologic reasons behind this clinical variability are under intense study and are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical staging and prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>During the initial asymptomatic phase, patients are able to maintain their usual lifestyles, but during the terminal phase the performance status is poor, with recurring need for hospitalization. The most frequent causes of death are severe systemic infection (especially pneumonia and septicemia), bleeding, and inanition with cachexia. Spontaneous clinical regression has been reported, but is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL STAGING AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of CLL is extremely variable, with survival times from initial diagnosis that range from approximately 2 to 20 years, and a median survival of approximately 10 years. Until the mid-1970s, there were no reliable clinically applicable criteria that would allow the prospective separation of patients with a poor outlook for survival from those with an excellent prognosis. This difficulty forced physicians to make decisions concerning the need for, and timing of, therapeutic intervention in their patients with CLL, almost exclusively on an empiric basis.</p><p>Reports published between 1966 and 1973 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>] constituted the basis on which Rai and colleagues developed a system of staging of CLL that could prospectively distinguish patients according to their overall outlook for survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This method of staging was recognized as a simple, yet accurate prognostic tool for estimating survival and received wide acceptance by clinicians.</p><p>With the advent of reliable criteria of stratification according to survival outlook, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B was able to initiate clinical trials in patients at different stages of this disease to test different therapeutic strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>During the ensuing years, several additional systems of clinical staging were proposed by investigators around the world, each having certain merits. A few of these staging systems are summarized below but only two, the Rai system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and the Binet system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], are in wide use in clinical practice as well as in research. The International Workshop Group on CLL (IWCLL) recommends that, in practice, an integrated system using both methods should be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. According to this recommendation, each Binet stage is to be further identified by the appropriate Rai stage (eg, A0, AI, AII, BI, BII, CIII, CIV). However, this integrated system has not been widely accepted and most clinicians today use either the Rai or Binet method for patient management and therapeutic investigation.</p><p>Patients with CLL are grouped prognostically according to the Rai and Binet staging systems based on physical examination and complete blood counts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56284\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56284 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80421\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80421 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96420 \">figure 1</a>). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is not routinely performed as part of the pretreatment evaluation, and is usually reserved for patients enrolled in clinical trials. However, a CT should be performed in any patients in whom enlarged abdominal or pelvic nodes are suspected based on evidence of complications such as obstructive jaundice or obstruction of the inferior vena cava or ureters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H5625565\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Pre-treatment evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Rai staging system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Rai system is based upon the concept that in CLL there is a gradual and progressive increase in the body burden of leukemic lymphocytes, starting in the blood and bone marrow (lymphocytosis), progressively involving lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), spleen and liver (organomegaly), with eventual compromise of bone marrow function (anemia and thrombocytopenia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56284\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56284 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96420 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the original series describing the Rai system, the stage at the time of initial diagnosis was approximately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 0 (lymphocytosis) &ndash; 25 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stages I to II (lymphadenopathy, organomegaly) &ndash; 50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stages III to IV (anemia, thrombocytopenia) &ndash; 25 percent</p><p/><p>Since this time, some reports have described a shift to earlier stages at initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], while others have not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This may reflect changes in the use of &quot;routine&quot; laboratory testing with complete blood counts. In addition, the estimated median survival by stage, described below, has improved as treatments have evolved.</p><p>In the original series describing the Rai system, the median survival from the time of diagnosis according to stage was [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 0 &ndash; 150 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I &ndash; 101 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II &ndash; 71 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stages III and IV &ndash; 19 months</p><p/><p>Although Rai and colleagues noted that there were only three distinct actuarial survival patterns (stage O, stages I and II combined, and stages III and IV combined), they recommended that the five-stage system be maintained to investigate prospectively whether biological and clinical differences would emerge between stages I and II and between stages III and IV. It became apparent in the 1980s, however, that it was impractical to stratify patients in five categories for prospective randomized trials. As a result, the staging system was modified to consist of three groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low risk &ndash; Rai stage O</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate risk &ndash; Rai stages I and II combined</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High risk &ndash; Rai stages III and IV combined</p><p/><p>With the passage of time, patients tend to progress from an early stage to an intermediate stage and eventually into an advanced stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, if complete or partial remission is achieved with successful therapy, and a patient's stage shifts from a higher risk to a lower risk category, the outlook for survival improves accordingly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As such, the prognosis for each stage has improved with the advent of new therapeutic regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Binet staging system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Binet staging system takes into consideration five potential sites of involvement: cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes (whether unilateral or bilateral, each area is counted as one), spleen, and liver.

CT scans may reveal enlargement of retroperitoneal or mediastinal nodes that are currently not included among the five sites of palpably enlarged lymphoid areas.</p><p>Patients with cytopenias due to autoimmune processes appear to have a better prognosis than patients with cytopenias due to bone marrow failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. This issue was addressed by a single institution retrospective study of 960 patients with CLL that identified an autoimmune cytopenia in 70 patients (7 percent) at some point during the disease process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients who were classified as stage C due to autoimmune cytopenias had a significantly better median survival than patients with cytopenias due to bone marrow infiltration (7.4 versus 3.7 years) and a worse median survival than those with stage A disease (10.2 years). Many patients with autoimmune cytopenias were able to normalize their blood counts after therapy directed at the autoimmune process and thereby postpone the initiation of chemotherapy.</p><p>While there may be other causes of low blood counts (eg, prior therapy, coexisting illness), these are not accounted for when determining stage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER PROGNOSTIC FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described in the previous section, the Rai and Binet staging systems were designed to provide prognostic information for patient care. Both of these systems are in wide use in clinical practice.</p><p>However, some patients classified as having early stage disease rapidly progress. For this reason, other prognostic factors have been investigated. Age, sex, and performance status have been correlated with prognosis but the significance and magnitude of this effect has varied among studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In separate studies, other factors have been correlated with shorter survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74103\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74103 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>The following section provides an introduction to many of these factors. Lymphocyte doubling time, beta-2 microglobulin, and genetic abnormalities are used clinically to provide prognostic information or guide therapy. The clinical use of newer prognostic markers (eg, CD38, ZAP-70, or IGHV gene mutation status, as well as gene mutations in SF3B1) is less clear.</p><p>Several prognostic factors have been tested and found to be of limited, if any, usefulness in predicting the course of nonadvanced stages of CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. These prognostic factors include: extent of blood lymphocytosis, morphologic features of blood lymphocytes (ie, the relative proportion of prolymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]), phenotypic profile of B-lymphocytes, age, sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], and levels of serum immunoglobulins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphocyte doubling time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) is the number of months it takes the absolute lymphocyte count to double. This can provide an estimation of the tempo of the disease; however, this factor is somewhat limited in usefulness because it takes time to measure. An actual or projected LDT in untreated patients &lt;12 months is associated with a progressive course and a longer LDT is associated with an indolent course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>In patients with early stage disease, the presence of a short doubling time may favor more aggressive therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific cytogenetic abnormalities identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and abnormalities in certain genes identified by molecular genetic testing confer prognostic significance in patients with CLL. In the pretreatment evaluation of patients with CLL, we routinely perform FISH of the peripheral blood for del(17p), del(11q), trisomy 12, and del(13q). Of these, del(13q) and trisomy 12 are favorable prognostic findings. Historically, patients with del(17p) or del(11q) have been at high risk of either not responding to initial treatment, or relapsing soon after achieving remission. The prognosis of patients with del(11q) has improved with the use of certain treatment regimens (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) while that of del(17p) or TP53 mutations remains poor despite such treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-therapy-for-symptomatic-or-advanced-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H5624038\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial therapy for symptomatic or advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'High-risk disease: del(17p) or TP53 mutations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H5625565\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Pre-treatment evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Our understanding regarding the prognostic value of specific cytogenetic and molecular findings in CLL is rapidly changing. While initial attempts have been made to incorporate this information into clinical practice, these will undoubtedly change in the future as the impact of combinations of molecular findings is analyzed further. The parameters of relevance for the selection of specific treatment options are 17p deletion and TP53 mutation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108430\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108430 \">figure 2</a>). Specific details regarding these individual cytogenetic abnormalities in CLL are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and genetic features of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies evaluating the prognostic impact of gene mutations in CLL have had disparate results, which may be due to small sample size, variation in the timing of sample collection, and heterogeneity of treatments used. The following analyses attempt to overcome some of these study limitations by using samples from patients enrolled on a prospective trial:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of patients enrolled on the randomized CLL8 trial evaluating the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (FCR) in previously untreated CLL, identified 17p deletion, TP53 mutation, 11q deletion, SF3B1 mutation, unmutated IGHV, and elevated thymidine kinase as independent were associated with short progression-free survival following initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. All but 11q deletion were also prognostic factors of short overall survival along with older age, poor performance status, and elevated beta-2 microglobulin. Median progression-free survival (PFS) rates following FCR for those with del(17p), <em>TP53</em> mutations, del(11q), or normal cytogenetics were approximately 12, 15, 50, and 50 months, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another analysis of samples from the CLL8 trial evaluated the prognostic impact of gene mutations found on whole exome sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This study reported shorter PFS with mutations in <em>TP53</em>, <em>SP3B1</em>, and <em>RPS15</em>. It did not confirm the inferior outcomes with mutations in <em>ATM</em>, <em>XPO1</em>, <em>EGR2</em>, <em>POT1</em>, <em>NOTCH1</em>, and <em>BIRC3</em> that had been reported in prior retrospective studies. Comparison of samples from before and after exposure to therapy found a high frequency of clonal evolution at the time of relapse.</p><p/><p>Further study is needed to confirm the prognostic value of these gene mutations and whether they retain their prognostic value in patients with relapsed or refractory disease and in the context of novel treatments (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idelalisib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">idelalisib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venetoclax-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venetoclax</a>). Initial studies also suggest the clinical importance of point mutations (eg, C481S) that disrupt the covalent binding of ibrutinib to Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and mutations in PLCG2, a downstream mediator of signal transduction activated by BTK.

Given the difficulty in obtaining results for some of these prognostic factors (eg, serum thymidine kinase levels, IGHV mutation status) in many areas of the world, including many institutions in the United States, the general applicability of this prognostic scoring system is limited. However, our understanding regarding the prognostic value of biologic and molecular findings in CLL such as these is rapidly changing. While initial attempts have been made to incorporate this information into clinical practice, these will undoubtedly change in the future with the creation of newer assays and as the impact of combinations of these findings is analyzed further.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180474480\"><span class=\"h3\">CLL-IPI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International CLL-IPI working group has proposed an international prognostic index for patients with CLL, which incorporates data regarding disease stage, biology, and patient-related factors.

As noted in one of the largest epidemiologic surveys, patients with CLL, compared with the general population, appear to have a two- to fivefold increased risk of developing a second lymphoid malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. In approximately 60 percent of cases, the transformed cells are clonally related to the original B-CLL cells while, in the remaining 40 percent, they appear to be derived from a separate cell of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The following are the most commonly reported transformations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive or highly aggressive lymphoma (Richter's transformation) &ndash; 3 to 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) &ndash; 2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hodgkin lymphoma &ndash; 0.5 to 2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple myeloma &ndash; 0.1 percent</p><p/><p>It is unclear whether treatment with either a purine nucleoside analogue or an anthracycline significantly increases the risk of a second lymphoid malignancy. A potentially increased incidence was initially suggested by an observational cohort study from the Mayo Clinic that followed 962 patients with CLL for a median of 3.3 years and reported that 26 patients (2.7 percent) developed a second lymphoid malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. In this study, prior treatment with a purine nucleoside analog or an anthracycline was associated with a higher likelihood of developing a second lymphoid malignancy. However, this association was not confirmed in the prospective CALGB 9011 study in which 521 patients with previously untreated CLL were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. After a minimum follow-up of 15 years, RT developed in 34 patients (7 percent) and PLL developed in 10 patients (2 percent). The incidence of RT and PLL was independent of initial therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Prolymphocytoid transformation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In approximately 10 percent of patients with CLL, the terminal event is a morphological transformation of blood lymphocytes from the typical small, mature-appearing cell to somewhat larger cells with distinct nucleoli and a less dense nuclear chromatin. This event, called prolymphocytoid transformation, occurs slowly over years and is associated with refractoriness to the usual chemotherapeutic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

The disorder is considered to be identical (ie, one disease with different manifestations) to the mature B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CLL is an extremely heterogeneous disease. While there had been a general belief that CLL is an indolent disease associated with a prolonged (ie, 10 to 20 years) clinical course, this observation is true for less than 30 percent of all CLL cases. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CLL are grouped prognostically according to the Rai and Binet staging systems based on physical examination and complete blood counts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56284\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56284 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80421\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80421 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96420 \">figure 1</a>). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is not routinely performed as part of the pretreatment evaluation, and is usually reserved for patients enrolled in clinical trials. However, a CT should be performed in any patients in whom enlarged abdominal or pelvic nodes are suspected based on evidence of complications such as obstructive jaundice or obstruction of the inferior vena cava or ureters. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical staging and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We routinely perform fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the peripheral blood for del(17p), del(11q), trisomy 12, and del(13q) and measure beta-2 microglobulin to provide prognostic information. Of these, del(13q), trisomy 12, and normal beta-2 microglobulin are favorable prognostic findings. Historically, patients with del(17p) or del(11q) have been at high risk of either not responding to initial treatment, or relapsing soon after achieving remission. The prognosis of patients with del(11q) has improved with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> while that of del(17p) or TP53 mutations remains poor despite such treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108430\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108430 \">figure 2</a>).
