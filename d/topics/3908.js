The designation Q fever (from Query) was made in 1935 following an outbreak of a febrile illness among abattoir (slaughterhouse) workers in Queensland, Australia. The name remains apt, however, since many questions persist about this special organism and unusual disease. Q fever is reportable in the United States and its agent<em>, C. burnetii</em>, is a potential agent of bioterrorism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Q fever will be reviewed here.

While for some patients the clinical manifestations of acute or chronic infection are severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], the clinical signs and symptoms of Q fever are mild or absent in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. As an example, an outbreak of 415 cases of Q fever occurred in Switzerland, and among those infected, 224 (54 percent) were asymptomatic and only 2 percent were hospitalized.</p><p>Factors that can affect the clinical presentation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age and gender</strong> &mdash; Symptomatic infection is more likely to occur in adults compared with children and in men compared with women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In an outbreak in France, surveillance data were obtained to describe variations in the clinical presentation of acute infection according to specific host factors, as well as monitor progression from acute to chronic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Serum samples were obtained from over 1000 individuals. Acute Q fever was diagnosed serologically in 101 (9.3 percent). Adult men were most likely to be symptomatic, followed by adult women, and children &le;14 years of age. Pregnant women were the least likely to be symptomatic (ie, 1 of 11 women). Five percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(5/101)</span> patients developed chronic disease, most had no known risk factors (eg, pregnancy, heart disease, immunocompromise).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among those who are symptomatic, the clinical manifestations also appear to vary with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As an example, in the largest collected case series, 1383 patients from France with symptomatic Q fever were identified over a 14-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Acute disease was identified in 77 percent of cases, and the most common manifestations were hepatitis, pneumonia plus hepatitis, pneumonia, and fever alone (40, 20, 17, and 17 percent, respectively). Hepatitis was more likely to occur in younger patients, while pneumonia was more commonly seen in elderly patients and those who were immunocompromised. In addition, patients with chronic Q fever were usually older than those with those with the acute form of the disease. Among such patients, endocarditis was the predominant manifestation (77 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Geographic location</strong> &mdash; The geographic origin of the infection, and the specific genotype in that location, may impact the clinical presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/2,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,9</a>]. As an example, in eastern Canada, pneumonia is more common than hepatitis, whereas in southern Spain and France, hepatitis is very common and pneumonia is rare. In French Guiana, where Q fever causes approximately 25 percent of community-acquired pneumonias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], infections are linked to the presence of a single genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>A more detailed discussion of the epidemiology of Q fever is found elsewhere.

Patients with acute Q fever can present with any of the following manifestations described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Flu-like illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A self-limited flu-like syndrome is the most common manifestation of acute infection. The onset is typically abrupt, with high-grade fevers (104&ordm;F or 40&ordm;C), fatigue, headache, and myalgias being the most frequent associated symptoms. In such patients, the headaches are usually severe and can be associated with photophobia. Febrile episodes usually last from one to three weeks. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of Q fever pneumonia are mild, and patients present with a non-productive cough and fever. Such individuals have minimal auscultatory abnormalities on exam. However, acute respiratory distress may occur in some patients. Findings on the chest radiograph are not specific and resemble a viral pneumonia. Pleural effusion may also occur, but it is uncommon. In addition to respiratory symptoms, patients often have extrapulmonary manifestations including severe headaches, myalgias, and arthralgias. Symptoms can last from 10 to 90 days. Mortality rates are low (ranging 0.5 to 1.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hepatic involvement present with transaminitis and can also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatomegaly, which usually occurs without jaundice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An acute febrile episode. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged fever of unknown origin with characteristic granulomas on liver biopsy.

Acute Q fever endocarditis was described in a case series that included 759 patients with acute Q fever, of whom 9 (1.2 percent) had valvular vegetations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. None of the patients had a known history of valvular heart disease and no embolic complications were reported. Acute endocarditis was associated with the presence of an IgG anticardiolipin antibody level &gt;100 immunoglobulin G-type phospholipid units (relative risk [RR] 24.9, 95% CI 4.5-140.2) and immunosuppression (eg, diabetes) (RR 10.1, 95% CI 3.0-32.4).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other manifestations of acute Q fever include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maculopapular or purpuric rash (10 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericarditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> myocarditis (1 percent). Myocarditis can be a particularly severe manifestation of Q fever. As an example, in one series that followed 1276 patients with Q fever over a 15-year period, only 8 developed myocarditis; however, myocarditis accounted for 17 percent of the 12 reported deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aseptic meningitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> encephalitis (1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>Other rare features include seizures, coma, polyradiculoneuritis, optic neuritis, hemophagocytosis, hemolytic anemia, transient hypoplastic anemia, thyroiditis, gastroenteritis, pancreatitis, lymphadenopathy mimicking lymphoma, erythema nodosum, bone marrow necrosis, inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis related to antiphospholipid antibodies, orchitis, acute acalculous cholecystitis, epididymitis, and splenic rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190131609\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laboratory findings during acute Q fever are nonspecific. Liver enzymes are elevated in as many as 85 percent of patients with transaminases ranging from 2 to 10 times normal values. Leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been noted in approximately 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The presence of these autoantibodies may be associated with acute Q fever endocarditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the development of persistent infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2234493885\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent localized infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent localized infections (eg, endocarditis, infection of aneurysms or vascular grafts, bone and joint infections) can develop in a patient after symptomatic acute Q fever or following asymptomatic infection. It occurs in approximately 1 to 5 percent of patients infected with <em>C. burnetii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], and is most likely to develop in those who are pregnant, immunocompromised (eg, patients receiving prolonged or high-dose corticosteroid therapy or tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors), have underlying valvular or vascular disease, or a prosthetic joint. In such patients, <em>C. burnetii</em> multiplies in macrophages and produces a prolonged bacteremia; the resulting high levels of antibodies and immune complexes directed at the organism contribute to many of the symptoms. </p><p>In the past, patients who developed persistent infection were classified as having &quot;chronic Q fever.&quot; However, patients were sometimes diagnosed with chronic Q fever without a clear focus of disease. This, in turn, led to controversy over how to define chronic Q fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In light of this, we prefer to describe the specific disease manifestation rather than use the term &quot;chronic Q fever&quot; to describe a specific clinical condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536975304\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic endocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with underlying valvular disease are at high risk for developing subacute or chronic endocarditis secondary to <em>C. burnetii</em>.
