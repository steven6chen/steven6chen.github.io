These include infants who were born preterm, require technological support, have complicated family issues, or have an irreversible condition that may result in early death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discharge-planning-for-high-risk-newborns/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Comprehensive discharge planning is required to minimize the risk of morbidity and mortality from premature discharge and to prevent prolongation of the hospital stay in an infant ready for discharge. It includes assessment of the neonate's medical status and readiness for discharge and preparation for families to care for their infant at home. Discharge planning for high-risk newborns will be presented here. The focus is primarily on preterm infants, as they represent the majority of NICU graduates. The care of the NICU graduate following discharge is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-of-the-neonatal-intensive-care-unit-graduate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Care of the neonatal intensive care unit graduate&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to home may place the high-risk infant at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. As a result, comprehensive discharge planning is needed to ensure a smooth transition from the NICU to home. Discharge planning should be developed and implemented by a multidisciplinary team consisting of parents, physicians, nurses, neonatal nurse practitioners, respiratory therapists, occupational <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical therapists, dieticians, pharmacists, case managers, social workers, and the identified primary care provider. The process begins shortly after an infant is admitted to the NICU and is continued through regularly scheduled planning sessions during hospitalization. Successful discharge preparation facilitates family readiness and, ultimately, improved outcomes in the important transition from the NICU to home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discharge-planning-for-high-risk-newborns/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The following are the components of discharge planning that are consistent with the 2008 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published discharge guidelines for the infant cared for in the NICU (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F117111\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef117111 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discharge-planning-for-high-risk-newborns/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. The successful completion of all of these is necessary prior to discharge. In addition, ensuring that parents feel prepared for discharge is essential and is enhanced by the NICU team's thorough communication with the community primary care provider and ensuring a smooth transition of health care providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/discharge-planning-for-high-risk-newborns/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal medical readiness, routine discharge screening and vaccination, and individual planning for specific conditions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parental discharge planning and education that includes readiness assessment of care providers and home environment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of risk factors and, if needed, referral for community services for additional support following discharge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transition and coordination of care from the NICU to the primary care provider and medical home</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1463535541\"><span class=\"h1\">NEONATAL DISCHARGE PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Discharge planning for the neonate includes assessment of the patient's medical status and readiness for discharge, completion of routine discharge screening and vaccination, ensuring safe transportation after discharge, and identifying additional needs for the individual patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical readiness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants ready for discharge must be medically stable and without any acute illness. </p><p>For preterm infants, discharge is considered only if an infant demonstrates physiologic stability by showing competency in all of the following functions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain normal body temperature (axillary temperature between 36.5 and 37.5&ordm;C [97.0 and 100.3&ordm;F]; rectal temperature between 36.6 and 38.0&ordm;C [97.8 to 100.4&ordm;F]) in an open crib with normal ambient temperature between 20 and 22.2&ordm;C (68 and 72&ordm;F).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstrate maturity of respiratory control without episodes of apnea and bradycardia.

Car inserts or padding may be placed on both sides of the infant to provide lateral support for the head and neck, if needed. The shoulder straps are adjusted into the lowest slots that ensure the infant's shoulders are above the slots.

The infant should never be placed in the front passenger seat in a car that has a front passenger-side air bag because of the risk of death or serious injury from the impact of a deployed air bag. Whenever possible, an adult should be seated adjacent to the infant and the infant <strong>should never be left unattended</strong> while in a car seat or bed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with documented cardiopulmonary compromise should travel in a supine or prone position in a car bed or other alternative safety device.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the infant requires home cardiac and apnea monitoring, this equipment should also be prescribed and used during travel.

For respiratory care equipment, a respiratory therapist assesses the home to evaluate outlets in the infant's area, measure door openings, inquire about electrical panel location and capacity, and ensure a safe environment. Arrangements can also be made for home nursing.
