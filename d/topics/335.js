Treatment is given even if throat cultures are negative to ensure eradication of streptococci that may persist in the upper respiratory tract. This approach is based upon extensive clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also prevent involvement of new joints. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> traditionally has been the first-line therapy based upon extensive clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. However, the newer NSAIDs, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, are increasingly used in the anti-inflammatory management of ARF. Alternative agents, such as low-dose glucocorticoids, are reserved for patients who do not tolerate or are allergic to aspirin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> naproxen. (See <a href=\"#H831027637\" class=\"local\">'Carditis management'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Arthritis'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Naproxen</a> has a superior side-effect profile to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and can be dosed twice daily. A single, small, open-label, randomized study found that naproxen had similar efficacy to aspirin with regard to time until resolution of arthritis but was safer and easier to use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Naproxen is dosed at 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> in divided doses every 12 hours to a maximum of 1000 mg per day in children aged over two years and 250 to 500 mg twice daily to a maximum of 1250 mg in adults. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ibuprofen</a> has been used successfully in younger children with rheumatic fever, but there are no specific published data to support its use.</p><p>The typical doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> used to reduce fever and alleviate arthritis symptoms are 80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in divided doses every four hours in children and 4 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in adults in divided doses every four to six hours. However, many experts recommend starting at a lower dose of 50 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> in children because of the risks of salicylate toxicity characterized by tinnitus, headache, and tachypnea.</p><p>Anti-inflammatory therapy should be continued until all joint symptoms have resolved, as long as the medication is well tolerated. Most patients require treatment for one to two weeks, although some patients require a longer course of treatment up to eight weeks. Recurrence of arthritis with reduction in the dose of anti-inflammatory treatment most likely reflects the &quot;rebound phenomenon&quot; of ARF; this does not represent a recurrent episode of ARF, but rather that a longer course of treatment is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-mechanism-of-action-major-toxicities-and-use-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin: Mechanism of action, major toxicities, and use in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H100643944\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H831027637\"><span class=\"h2\">Carditis management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstays of management of rheumatic carditis are early diagnosis and assessment of severity using echocardiography, management of heart failure and other complications when present, and commencement of secondary prophylaxis. There is no evidence that anti-inflammatory treatment improved cardiac outcomes. Thus, NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) are not routinely recommended for the treatment of carditis without joint symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9-12</a>]. The one exception is severe heart failure, where there may be a role for glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H1964769680\" class=\"local\">'Severe carditis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1964769680\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe carditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe carditis (significant cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> third-degree heart block) should be treated with conventional therapy for heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some experts recommend the use of glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> maximum daily dose 80 mg) in patients with severe carditis with acute cardiac failure despite an absence of high-quality evidence. However, the side effects of glucocorticoids include gastrointestinal bleeding and fluid retention, both of which can worsen cardiac failure. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> or NSAIDs can be stopped during the period that glucocorticoids are prescribed but should be restarted once glucocorticoid treatment is discontinued. Glucocorticoids are stopped when heart failure is controlled and inflammatory markers have improved. If a course longer than one week is needed, then it is prudent to taper the dose by approximately 25 percent per week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4244342362\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for valve surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valve surgery is rarely necessary in patients with acute rheumatic carditis, usually only in patients with valve leaflet or chordae tendineae rupture where surgery can be lifesaving. It may be necessary in patients with severe lesions that are identified later in life and in whom heart failure due to regurgitant mitral or aortic valve lesions cannot be managed with medical therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,14</a>]. Surgical outcomes are generally better if valve surgery is performed when carditis is quiescent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Valve repair, if feasible, is preferred over valve replacement since repair avoids the need for long-term anticoagulation associated with mechanical valves and the long-term risk of deterioration of a bioprosthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>].</p><p>The management of valve disease in rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prevention-of-rheumatic-heart-disease#H1253623486\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prevention of rheumatic heart disease&quot;, section on 'Management of rheumatic heart disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3364150890\"><span class=\"h2\">Sydenham chorea management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sydenham chorea is generally self-limited, and most cases do not require treatment beyond the usual chronic antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrence of ARF and minimize the risk of RHD. Psychologic and social support, including support for the educational needs of the child, are important elements of management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Rest in a quiet setting can help minimize stressful factors that may worsen symptoms. Symptomatic treatment (eg, a dopamine 2 receptor blocking agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, or valproic acid) is reserved for patients with symptoms that are distressing for the patient and their family or that interfere with activities of daily living or that place the patient at risk of injury. <span class=\"nowrap\">Anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory</span> therapies (eg, glucocorticoids, IVIG) are restricted to patients with severe chorea who have failed other therapy. In patients with moderate to severe chorea, referral to a pediatric neurologist or movement disorder specialist can help guide management. The management of Sydenham chorea is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sydenham-chorea#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sydenham chorea&quot;, section on 'Treatment of chorea'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sydenham-chorea#H732972167\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sydenham chorea&quot;, section on 'Immune modulation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chorea#H29672870\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chorea&quot;, section on 'Management of chorea'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2052052\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rash associated with ARF is temporary and does not require specific treatment, although antihistamines may help to alleviate pruritus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100643944\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may be useful for monitoring the acute disease process. The CRP is probably more useful since it typically normalizes over a matter of days once an episode of acute inflammation has resolved, while the ESR may stay elevated for up to two months after a transient inflammatory stimulus. However, the susceptibility of this measurement to artefact and other causes of inflammation may limit its use for this purpose.</p><p>We check CRP twice weekly initially and then every one to two weeks until levels have normalized off therapy. Normalization of inflammatory markers is an indication of resolution, whereas an increase as treatment is tapered suggests a rebound of inflammation. A normal result obtained a few weeks after discontinuing anti-inflammatory therapy suggests that the course of the illness is complete (unless chorea appears).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2052695\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR RECURRENT DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors are associated with an increased risk of recurrent ARF, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor adherence to secondary prophylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A greater number of previous attacks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A shorter time interval since the last attack.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher likelihood of ongoing exposure to streptococcal infections, which includes children, those in close contact with children (parents, health care workers), and those living in crowded situations (college students, military personnel) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of cardiac involvement.

However, at least one-third of ARF episodes occur in the setting of subclinical streptococcal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, ARF is not preventable in symptomatic patients who do not seek medical care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary prevention (antibiotic prophylaxis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have had an attack of ARF and develop subsequent GAS pharyngitis are at high risk for a recurrent attack of ARF. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) becomes more severe with each recurrent episode. Thus, the most effective method to limit progression of RHD severity is prevention of recurrent GAS pharyngitis. We recommend continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis, rather than recognition and treatment of acute GAS pharyngitis episodes, because GAS infection does not need to be symptomatic to trigger a recurrent attack of ARF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Continuous prophylaxis is warranted for patients with a well-documented history of ARF (including cases with Sydenham chorea as the sole manifestation), as well as those with definite evidence of RHD. Antibiotic prophylaxis is usually provided in the primary care setting rather than by tertiary care organizations and consulting cardiologists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During the course of prophylaxis, patients and their household contacts who develop acute episodes of GAS pharyngitis should be evaluated and treated promptly. Patients with breakthrough GAS pharyngitis on penicillin should be treated with an alternative agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon limited evidence, secondary prevention for recurrent ARF consists of years of prophylactic antibiotic administration. The total duration depends upon risk of recurrent ARF and severity of disease. The duration of prophylaxis following ARF is outlined by severity category in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55223 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>]. In the setting of carditis, prophylaxis should continue until the patient is a young adult (21 years of age), which is usually approximately 10 years from the initial acute attack with no recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26,27</a>]. Antibiotic prophylaxis should continue even after valve surgery, including prosthetic valve replacement.</p><p>Other patients may not require such lengthy duration of treatment. In a Chilean study of 59 patients with a history of ARF without carditis, prophylaxis was discontinued after five years or at age 18 years (whichever was longer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. During 3349 patient-months of follow-up, only two ARF recurrences were observed (0.7 per 100 patient-years). These data suggest that ARF prophylaxis can be discontinued safely in young adults judged to be at low risk for recurrence who are maintained under careful prospective surveillance.</p><p>The risk for GAS exposure and severity of valvular disease should be reviewed upon reaching the end of a planned course for secondary prophylaxis. A decision regarding cessation or continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis should be made based upon individual clinical risks and benefits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a> is preferred for all patients.

Penicillin allergy should be verified by history and confirmed with testing by an allergy specialist if necessary before choosing an alternative to penicillin G benzathine. Switching from intramuscular to oral prophylaxis once patients have reached young adulthood and have remained free of rheumatic attacks is appropriate if antibiotic prophylaxis is continued.

Most patients are started on a 28-day regimen. Patients that develop a breakthrough episode of ARF despite good adherence to a 28-day regimen can be switched to a 21-day regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Oral alternatives are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68830 \">table 3</a>).

This approach is also warranted for individuals in low-incidence regions who have had recurrent ARF despite adherence to a regimen administered every four weeks.</p><p>The long-term benefits of intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a> prophylaxis outweigh the risk of allergic reaction since life-threatening allergic reactions are rare in patients who receive intramuscular injections of penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Options for oral prophylaxis include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-v-potassium-oral-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin V</a>, macrolides, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfadiazine</a>. The preferred oral agent is penicillin V (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68830 \">table 3</a>). A macrolide (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>) is usually the most appropriate agent for patients allergic to penicillin. Sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole are less frequently used.</p><p>Success with oral prophylaxis depends on patient adherence, so clear communication regarding the importance of prophylaxis and how antibiotics should be taken is critical. Even with optimal adherence, the risk of recurrence is higher in individuals receiving oral prophylaxis than those receiving intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This was illustrated in a controlled trial of 405 children and adolescents with rheumatic fever assigned to receive four weeks of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> potassium, or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfadiazine</a>. In the first two years of the study, streptococcal infections recurred in 7, 20, and 24 percent of patients, respectively, and ARF recurred in 0, 4.8, and 2.7 percent of the patients, respectively.</p><p>Patients and their household contacts who develop symptoms suggestive of GAS pharyngitis during the course of prophylaxis should be evaluated and treated promptly.

The most crucial advice for patients is the importance of continuing secondary prophylaxis even though they will be mostly asymptomatic. In addition, it is essential to educate patients about the importance of treating sore throats early and recommending a nonpenicillin antibiotic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>) for this if the patient is taking penicillin prophylaxis.</p><p>Oral health is important in these patients because they are at high risk of developing infective endocarditis. Thus, patients should receive education about dental care. Patients with carditis should be encouraged to inform their doctor or dentist prior to any interventional procedure so that appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis can be given. A laminated card with the relevant details of the treatment can be helpful for patients and caregivers.</p><p>Given the risks of <span class=\"nowrap\">ARF/RHD</span> in pregnancy and labor, every female of childbearing age receiving secondary prophylaxis should also be given detailed family <span class=\"nowrap\">planning/contraception</span> advice as an integral part of the education program.

Whether it is a separate entity from arthritis associated with ARF is somewhat controversial since PSRA can be difficult to distinguish from arthritis associated with ARF on clinical grounds. In addition, a small proportion of patients with PSRA have been observed to develop valvular heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

The echocardiogram is repeated at 12 to 24 months. Evidence of valvular disease after one year should prompt continued prophylaxis as outlined in the preceding sections, and it may be presumed that the presenting symptoms were manifestations of ARF. Antibiotic prophylaxis is discontinued if the echocardiogram is normal, and the patient is re-evaluated annually over a period of a few years. However, children from high-risk groups (eg, an Aboriginal patient or Pacific Islander) are treated as having ARF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473726730\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Signs and symptoms of ARF develop two to three weeks following pharyngitis and include arthritis, carditis, chorea, subcutaneous nodules, and erythema marginatum. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of ARF consists of symptomatic relief of arthritis with anti-inflammatory therapy, eradication of GAS infection with antibiotic therapy, and heart failure management. There is no therapy documented to slow progression of valvular damage in the setting of ARF. Measurement of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) may be used to monitor resolution of the acute process. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H100643944\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with ARF are treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) until all joint symptoms have resolved (usually one to two weeks), as long as the medication is well tolerated. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> (80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in children and 4 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in adults) has been traditionally used for symptomatic relief of acute disease manifestations, although there is increasing experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, which has fewer side effects and can be dosed twice daily. (See <a href=\"#H2051605\" class=\"local\">'Arthritis management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend starting patients with ARF on antibiotic therapy as delineated for eradication of streptococcal pharyngitis, whether or not pharyngitis is present at the time of diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64596 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). In practice, this is often best achieved by administration of a dose of intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a>, which also serves as the first dose of secondary prophylaxis. In addition, patients from tropical regions such as northern Australia, in whom ARF may be triggered by GAS pyoderma, require appropriate therapy for any skin infections present. (See <a href=\"#H3587246766\" class=\"local\">'Eradication of GAS carriage'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=impetigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Impetigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with severe carditis should be treated with conventional therapy for heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H831027637\" class=\"local\">'Carditis management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of initial attacks (primary prevention) and recurrent attacks (secondary prevention or prophylaxis) of ARF depends upon control of GAS tonsillopharyngitis (or pyoderma in tropical locations). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary prevention is accomplished by prompt diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of GAS infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-streptococcal-pharyngitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of streptococcal pharyngitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Secondary prevention is accomplished by prevention of recurrent GAS pharyngitis or pyoderma. We recommend continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis, rather than recognition and treatment of acute GAS episodes, because GAS infection does not need to be symptomatic to trigger a recurrent attack of ARF (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prevention (antibiotic prophylaxis)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In general, prophylaxis in the setting of carditis should continue until the patient is a young adult (21 years of age), which is usually approximately 10 years from the initial acute attack with no recurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55223 \">table 2</a>). The risk for GAS exposure and severity of valvular disease should be reviewed upon reaching the end of a planned course for secondary prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2052695\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>The preferred parenteral antibiotic for prophylaxis is long-acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a> administered intramuscularly every 21 to 28 days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68830 \">table 3</a>). Oral antibiotic prophylaxis is an option for patients at lower risk for ARF recurrence or those with an allergy to penicillin.
