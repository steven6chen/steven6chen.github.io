Cluster headache is the most prominent of these entities. The concept of the TACs is useful for clinicians seeking a pathophysiologic understanding of the primary neurovascular headaches and a rational therapeutic approach to treating or preventing these headaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-the-trigeminal-autonomic-cephalalgias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This review focuses on the epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of cluster headache. Treatment and prognosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cluster headache: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of cluster headache is complex and remains incompletely understood. The most widely accepted theory is that primary cluster headache is characterized by hypothalamic activation with secondary activation of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex, probably via a trigeminal-hypothalamic pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81378\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81378 \">figure 1</a>). Another theory holds that neurogenic inflammation of the walls of the cavernous sinus obliterates venous outflow and thus injures the traversing sympathetic fibers of the intracranial internal carotid artery and its branches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-the-trigeminal-autonomic-cephalalgias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of cluster headache is &lt;1 percent and mostly affects men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 16 population-based epidemiologic studies, the following observations were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lifetime prevalence of cluster headache for adults of all ages was 124 per 100,000 (95% CI 101-154), or approximately 0.1 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The one year prevalence of cluster headache was 53 per 100,000 (95% CI 26-95)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall male to female ratio was 4.3:1</p><p/><p>There is some evidence that the male preponderance in cluster headache is decreasing, particularly in patients with headache onset after 1960 or 1970 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. The probable explanation is improved understanding of the pathophysiology of this syndrome and consequently a higher acceptance and awareness leading to more frequent diagnosis. However, this finding has not been confirmed in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p>Some reports have noted an apparently high incidence of head trauma in patients with cluster headache. As an example, one study of 374 patients found a history of head injury prior to cluster headache onset in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, such an association does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship. In addition, the average time between head injury and cluster headache onset (10 years) seems too long to support a causative role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before 1990, cluster headache was not thought of as an inherited disorder. However, the importance of considering genetic factors in the etiology is highlighted by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of monozygotic twins, both had cluster headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiologic studies have reported a family history of cluster headache in 5 to 20 percent of patients with cluster headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13-15</a>]. Compared with the general population, the risk of cluster headache for first-degree relatives was increased by 14- to 39-fold, and for second-degree relatives by 2- to 8-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p/><p>The evidence of increased familial risk supports the hypothesis that cluster headache has a genetic component, at least in some families.</p><p>Results of a complex segregation analysis in one study suggested that an autosomal dominant gene may play a role in cluster headache inheritance in some families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], although there is also evidence for autosomal recessive or multifactorial inheritance in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Future studies must take into account that cluster headache can start between the age of 7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and 83 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and that the distinction between affected and unaffected individuals is clearly provisional.</p><p>Another issue concerns evidence that up to 85 percent of patients with cluster headache are also chronic cigarette smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Quitting smoking has no effect on the disease. However, smoking may be a risk factor for the development of cluster headache, possibly on the basis of a genetic predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A study of clinically-detected cluster headache showed a marked decline in the incidence of cluster headaches between 1979-81 and 1990-91 in Olmsted County, Minnesota, during a time when the incidence of smoking declined in the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cluster headache is characterized by attacks of severe orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain, accompanied by autonomic phenomena <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> restless or agitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The stereotypical attacks may strike up to eight times a day and are relatively short-lived. Cluster headache is strictly unilateral, and the symptoms remain on the same side of the head during a single cluster attack. However, the symptoms can switch to the other side during a different cluster attack (so-called side shift) in approximately 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In contrast to migraineurs, patients with cluster are restless and prefer to pace about or sit and rock back and forth. The attacks of cluster headache can be so vicious that patients may commit suicide if the disease is not diagnosed or treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The unilateral autonomic symptoms associated with cluster headache, such as ptosis, miosis, lacrimation, conjunctival injection, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion, occur only during the pain attack and are ipsilateral to the pain. These symptoms are indicative of both parasympathetic hyperactivity and sympathetic impairment. In some patients, the signs of sympathetic paralysis (miosis and ptosis) persist indefinitely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], but intensify during attacks. Sweating and cutaneous blood flow also increase on the painful side, particularly in areas of sympathetic deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>About 3 percent of all patients lack autonomic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In rare cases, sympathetic disturbances persist on the previously-affected side of the face in patients whose cluster headache has switched sides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Circadian periodicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another clinical landmark of the cluster headache syndrome is the circadian rhythmicity of the relatively short-lived (15 to 180 minutes) painful attacks. In the episodic form of cluster headache, attacks occur daily for some weeks followed by a period of remission. In the chronic form, attacks occur without significant periods of remission. On average, a cluster period lasts 6 to 12 weeks while remissions can last up to 12 months or longer.</p><p>The episodic form is the most common, affecting 80 to 90 percent of patients with cluster headache. It is characterized by periods of attacks (clusters or bouts) and periods of remission. In a bout, patients may experience one to eight attacks per day, and bouts may last from seven days to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. When not in a bout, patients are usually asymptomatic.</p><p>The chronic form of cluster headache lacks remissions and is diagnosed after a year without remission, or if remission has lasted less than one month. Chronic cluster may arise de novo (primary chronic cluster headache) or evolve from the episodic type (secondary chronic cluster headache).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cluster headache, in its typical form, is unmistakable.

However, typical attacks of paroxysmal hemicrania are shorter (2 to 30 minutes) and more frequent (more than five attacks per day) than cluster attacks. In addition, the autonomic symptoms are often less severe than in cluster headache. About 80 percent of patients with paroxysmal hemicrania have the chronic form, while the remaining 20 percent have the episodic form.

These lesions included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracranial large artery aneurysms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningiomas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain arteriovenous malformations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pituitary macroadenomas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metallic foreign body in the maxillary sinus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspergilloma in sphenoid sinus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign posterior fossa tumor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cavernous hemangioma</p><p/><p>In each case, the headache improved after treatment of the lesion, suggesting but not proving a causal role for the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Given that the headaches were often without atypical features, the results of this study suggest that all patients with symptoms of cluster headaches should have neuroimaging to exclude a cranial lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

The most widely accepted theory is that primary cluster headache is characterized by hypothalamic activation with secondary activation of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex, probably via a trigeminal-hypothalamic pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81378\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81378 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lifetime prevalence of cluster headache is &lt;1 percent, and the disorder mainly affects men. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that cluster headache has a genetic component, at least in some families. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cluster headache is characterized by attacks of severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain, accompanied by autonomic phenomena. Unilateral autonomic symptoms are ipsilateral to the pain and may include ptosis, miosis, lacrimation, conjunctival injection, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. Attacks usually last 15 to 180 minutes. In the episodic form, attacks can occur daily, usually one to eight times a day for some weeks, followed by a period of remission. The chronic form of cluster headache lacks sustained remissions. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cluster headache, in its typical form, is unmistakable. The diagnosis is exclusively a clinical one (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80843 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasionally, patients with atypical or even typical clinical features of cluster headache are found to have a potential secondary cause, such as a structural brain lesion. For patients with suspected cluster headache, we suggest neuroimaging with a cranial CT scan or a cranial MRI study to exclude abnormalities of the brain and pituitary gland. We recommend neuroimaging for patients with an abnormal neurologic examination or those with clinical suspicion for a pituitary abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Secondary cluster headache'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of cluster headache involves consideration of other unilateral, brief but frequent headaches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65541 \">table 2</a>), including the following (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Paroxysmal hemicrania</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT syndrome) and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA syndrome) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trigeminal neuralgia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary stabbing headache</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Headache associated with an underlying intracranial lesion (ie, secondary cluster headache)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment and prognosis of cluster headache is reviewed separately.
