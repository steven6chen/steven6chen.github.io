Preservation of this residual kidney function has been associated with improved outcomes, and nephrologists should try to preserve this residual kidney function as long as possible. Even when the GFR is very low, the urine output is variable, ranging from oliguria to normal or even above normal levels. These findings are related to the fact that the urine output is determined not by the GFR alone, but also by the difference between the GFR and the rate of tubular reabsorption. If, for example, a patient with advanced acute or chronic kidney failure has a GFR of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> (versus the normal of 140 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day),</span> the daily urine output will still be 1.5 L if only 3.5 L of the filtrate is reabsorbed.</p><p>It had been thought that tubular damage impaired the ability to reabsorb sodium and water, thereby contributing to the maintenance of an adequate urine output in this setting. However, it seems more likely that volume expansion (due to initial sodium retention) and a urea osmotic diuresis (as the daily urea load is excreted by fewer functioning nephrons), due in part to solute intake, play a more important role in the persistent urine output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>In comparison, water intake (which usually determines the urine output via changes in the secretion of antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) plays relatively little role in regulating the urine output in advanced kidney disease. These patients can neither dilute nor concentrate the urine normally; the range of urine osmolality that can be achieved in the typical patient with advanced chronic kidney disease varies from a minimum of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> to a maximum of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> compared with 50 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The net effect of this ADH resistance is that variations in ADH release in response to changes in water intake have relatively little effect on the urine output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL IMPORTANCE OF RESIDUAL KIDNEY FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The loss of residual kidney function in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) has important clinical manifestations. This includes adverse effects upon volume control and patient survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. There are two essential components to residual kidney function: renal clearance of uremic toxins and urinary volume. Urinary volume is being seen as increasingly important.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the remaining glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may only be 4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in patients begun on maintenance dialysis, this is sufficient to make a significant contribution to the removal of potential uremic toxins since filtration is continuous, as opposed to the 12 hours per week that the patient is undergoing hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, residual kidney function allows for the clearance of larger molecules, such as beta-2 microglobulin, that dialysis filters cannot remove. Thus, this residual function encompasses more than the urea clearance that can be calculated as a contribution to dialysis dose. Even in patients with residual kidney function less than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> patients who were not anuric had significantly lower levels of uremic solutes such as nonindoxyl sulfate and asymmetric dimethylarginine than patients on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continued urine output also facilitates the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance and may enhance nutritional status and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/8,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid removal is an essential function of the kidney and the one most identifiable by patients. The amount of urine output in dialysis patients equates to fluid that does not need to be removed with dialysis (either peritoneal or hemodialysis). In hemodialysis, decreasing fluid removal with each dialysis treatment decreases the possibility of intradialytic hypotension, which can lead to myocardial stunning, ischemia, and increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study of 1946 patients from Korea, after adjustment for potential confounders, urine volume was significantly associated with survival, with GFR losing significance when urine volume was in the model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In an analysis of the CANUSA study of incident peritoneal dialysis patients, there was a 36 percent reduction in relative risk of death with increased urine volume; residual GFR was not associated with improved mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Therefore, one should adopt measures aimed at preserving residual kidney function among peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients and improving endogenous fluid removal through increased urine volume. Even if urea clearance is small, the urinary volume is beneficial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF DIALYSIS MODALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both volume expansion and the high urea load per nephron are rapidly reversed by dialysis (of any form), which removes sodium, water, and urea. Therefore, it is not surprising that many patients have a marked reduction in, or even cessation of, urine output when dialysis is instituted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This observation has raised the question of whether dialysis itself worsens or delays recovery of residual kidney function in patients with chronic kidney failure. This issue is unresolved in acute kidney failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis-related factors that may influence recovery of renal function in acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Peritoneal and hemodialysis may have different effects on residual kidney function. This is discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For reasons that are incompletely understood, the loss of residual kidney function appears to occur more rapidly with hemodialysis than with peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/9,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19-22</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 279 hemodialysis and 243 peritoneal dialysis patients, loss of residual kidney function was greater in hemodialysis patients than peritoneal dialysis patients, with peritoneal dialysis patients on average having a 30 percent higher residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 811 hemodialysis and 1032 peritoneal dialysis patients, peritoneal dialysis patients had a 65 percent lower risk of oliguria (self-reported urine volume &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day)</span> at one year of follow-up compared with hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p>However, it is important to note that many of the studies addressing this issue are older, and, at the time, modern hemodialytic techniques such as volumetric control, ultrapure water, and biocompatible membranes were not in use. Residual kidney function has also been studied extensively in the peritoneal dialysis population, but there have been few studies in the hemodialysis population.</p><p>Potential reasons for differences in loss of residual kidney function with hemodialysis include intermittent hypotension and activation of nephrotoxic inflammatory mediators during treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. In one study of 522 patients initiating either peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis, predictors of the rate of decline in residual kidney function at baseline included a higher diastolic blood pressure and increased proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Over time, decreases in residual kidney function were associated with hypotension with hemodialysis and dehydration episodes with peritoneal dialysis. Relatively higher kidney function was consistently observed with peritoneal dialysis, which increased over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another possible explanation for the different effect upon residual kidney function is that volume expansion with continuous peritoneal dialysis may help to preserve kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/22,23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23,25</a>]. In one study that examined volume control versus the use of antihypertensive agents for control of hypertension in hemodialysis patients with a baseline urine production of approximately 1600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day,</span> urine output dropped by only 12 percent during treatment with antihypertensive medications, but, with the use of volume removal, urine output decreased to &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Blood pressure control improved, and left ventricular mass decreased significantly with volume removal.</p><p>As mentioned above, newer hemodialytic techniques may result in a slower rate of decline of residual kidney function. In one study, the loss of residual kidney function was similar in a comparison of 175 patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) versus 300 patients dialyzed with ultrapure water, bicarbonate buffer, and high-flux polysulphone membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The loss of residual kidney function may be more rapid in hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis patients. However, most of the studies that have examined this issue are older, and the data are inconclusive (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis modality and patient outcome&quot;, section on 'Selection of dialysis modality'</a>). It is reasonable to mention to patients who are preparing for dialysis that residual kidney function is likely better preserved using peritoneal dialysis rather than hemodialysis. However, survival with either modality appears to be equivalent, and lifestyle preferences should remain the predominant factor when choosing dialysis modality.

Patients assigned to frequent nocturnal dialysis (six times per week) had significantly lower urine volume and urea clearance at 4 and 12 months compared with conventional nocturnal dialysis (three times per week). There was no significant difference in loss of urine volume or residual kidney function in patients who did frequent versus conventional daily dialysis, although there was likely not enough statistical power to identify a difference.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a retrospective review of patients who initiated dialysis in a large dialysis organization in the US, among 351 individuals who started hemodialysis with fewer than three treatments per week, both renal urea clearance and urine volume declined more slowly over time compared with a matched cohort of 8065 patients who dialyzed thrice weekly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Among both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients, continued residual kidney function is associated with improved survival. We therefore suggest the adoption of measures aimed at preserving residual kidney function among peritoneal dialysis patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) and hemodialysis patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Therefore, many patients have a marked reduction in, or even cessation of, urine output when dialysis is instituted.

It is preferable to maintain euvolemia with diuretics rather than increased ultrafiltration. (See <a href=\"#H7291615\" class=\"local\">'Factors that may affect residual kidney function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residual kidney function may be better maintained in patients on peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis.
