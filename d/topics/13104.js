Approximately 76 percent arise in soft tissue, the remainder in bone.</p><p>There is no clearly defined etiology in most cases of soft tissue sarcoma, but a number of associated or predisposing factors have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These include a genetic predisposition, gene mutations, radiation therapy (RT), chemotherapy, chemical carcinogens, chronic irritation, and lymphedema. In addition, an association between viral infection and sarcoma has been shown for HIV and human herpesvirus 8 in Kaposi sarcoma, and for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and smooth muscle tumors in immunocompromised patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC PREDISPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas, particularly children, have a genetic predisposition to cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. In some cases, individuals are from families with a defined inherited predisposing condition, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or retinoblastoma, but many cases do not fit recognized inherited cancer syndromes. One analysis, in which 1162 patients with sarcoma, unselected for family history, underwent targeted exon sequencing of 72 genes selected for their association with cancer risk, concluded that approximately one-half of the patients had putatively pathogenic, monogenic, and polygenic variation in known and novel cancer genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a pooled analysis of all sarcoma probands, 240 carried multiple variants, suggesting a polygenic contribution to sarcoma risk. Only 155 (17 percent) of the 911 families with informative pedigrees fit recognizable cancer syndromes.</p><p>The major genetic syndromes are briefly outlined below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Li-Fraumeni syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in <em>TP53</em> are the most common germline mutations that predispose to pediatric sarcomas, including osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As many as 7 percent of children with soft tissue sarcomas may have LFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a series of 151 children with soft tissue sarcomas, for example, five of the families (3.3 percent) manifested the classic LFS familial cancer syndrome, 10 (6.6 percent) had features consistent with the syndrome, and 16 (10.5 percent) had one parent with a possible hereditary cancer syndrome or with cancer before the age of 60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The LFS is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, and a germline mutation in the <em>TP53</em> tumor suppressor gene is found in most affected families (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'TP53 gene'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. LFS is primarily characterized by soft tissue and bone sarcomas and breast cancer; other features include brain tumor, leukemia, and adrenocortical cancer occurring before the age of 45. The cumulative case risk among affected individuals is 100 percent by age 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Sarcomas account for 25 to 33 percent of tumors in affected individuals, and they arise at a younger age than those unassociated with LFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In one series of individuals from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) database, 96 percent of the sarcomas arising in individuals with LFS arose before the age of 50, compared with 38 percent before 50 years of age in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The gene itself appears to predispose to second cancers of bone and soft tissue, with radiation therapy (RT) shortening the latent period and increasing the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>These relationships were illustrated in a longitudinal study of 1601 patients with RB (963 with the inherited type) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. The cumulative frequency of a second cancer at 50 years after diagnosis was significantly different based upon whether the patient had the genetic form of RB (bilateral tumors or unilateral disease with a positive family history) versus nongenetic form of RB (ie, unilateral disease in the absence of a positive family history, due to a somatic mutation) (36 versus 6 percent), and whether the second tumor was associated with RT or not (38 versus 21 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. More than 60 percent of the cancers were sarcomas.</p><p>A later publication provided a detailed description of 69 secondary soft tissue sarcomas among 68 children with hereditary RB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Almost all of the sarcomas (n = 66) developed in children who had received orbital RT, but 18 did not arise within the irradiated field. The predominant histology was leiomyosarcoma (33 percent), followed by fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), soft tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">tumors/sarcomas</span> not otherwise specified, rhabdomyosarcoma, and liposarcoma (19, 17, 15, 12, and 4 percent of cases, respectively).</p><p>There were some major differences between histologic types. Leiomyosarcomas were diagnosed more often outside of the RT field than within it (14 of 23), suggesting that genetic predisposition may have played a more important role than RT. Leiomyosarcoma was also the only histology for which risk was significantly higher among patients receiving chemotherapy plus RT versus RT alone. Furthermore, these were also late developing tumors; 18 were diagnosed more than 30 years after diagnosis (ie, at the same age as individuals in the general population).</p><p>In contrast, seven of eight secondary rhabdomyosarcomas occurred within the RT field, and seven developed within 20 years of treatment, during a normal growth period.</p><p>These data underscore the need for long-term surveillance for second cancers in RB survivors, particularly for those with the bilateral or inherited form of the disease.

In many cases, the aberrant protein product of the fused gene acts as an abnormal transcriptional regulator, thus providing the molecular basis for oncogenesis. Just as specific mutations in <em>KIT</em> impact the diagnosis and response to therapy in GIST, for many fusion gene-related sarcomas, molecular testing to identify specific translocations that are unique to certain subtypes of sarcoma can be used for diagnostic refinement, prognostic assessment, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

One study performed DNA sequencing of 722 protein-coding genes that have been implicated in cancer in 200 samples of soft tissue sarcomas encompassing seven distinct histological subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Frequently mutated genes included the <em>TP53</em> tumor suppressor gene (17 percent of pleomorphic liposarcomas), type 1 neurofibromatosis (<em>NF1</em>; 10.5 percent of myxofibrosarcomas and 8 percent of pleomorphic liposarcomas), and <em>PIK3CA</em> (18 percent of <span class=\"nowrap\">myxoid/round</span> cell liposarcomas). The retinoblastoma (<em>RB</em>) gene was mutated in 4 percent of pleomorphic liposarcomas. DNA amplifications of chromosome 12q were observed in 90 percent of patients with dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Genes amplified in the 12q13-15 amplicon in well differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas include <em>MDM2</em>, <em>HMGA2</em>, <em>YEATS4</em>, <em>CDK4</em>, and <em>SAS</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Whole-genome sequencing has been performed on childhood rhabdomyosarcomas. One study analyzed 16 rhabdomyosarcoma tumors from 13 patients and compared the results with matched normal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

These studies provide a comprehensive genomic analysis that reveals the landscape of gene mutations in rhabdomyosarcoma. These studies show that rhabdomyosarcomas fall into two broad categories. The first group includes alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas that contain a <em>Pax3</em> or <em>Pax7</em> translocation without other recurrent cancer mutations. The second group is embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, which are characterized by mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase, <em>RAS</em>, <em>PIK3CA</em> axis. Interestingly, mutations in <em>RAS</em> or <em>NF1</em>, which negatively regulates Ras, were significantly associated with more aggressive tumors (ie, intermediate and high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma). Therefore, the <em>RAS</em> is a critical driver mutation for embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and a potential therapeutic target [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Mutations in the <em>KIT</em> protooncogene, which are associated with GISTs, are discussed elsewhere.
