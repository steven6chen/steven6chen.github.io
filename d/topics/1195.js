Many disorders that cause pancytopenia can also cause bicytopenia (ie, decreases in only two cell lines); thus, in most cases the evaluation of bicytopenia is similar to that presented here. </p><p>Individual laboratories typically establish their own reference ranges for <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit,</span> white blood cell count, and platelet count. These institutional cutoff values supersede published reference standards such as those published by the World Health Organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-pancytopenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red blood cells &ndash; Hemoglobin &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for non-pregnant women and &lt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for men</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White blood cells &ndash; Because neutrophils constitute the majority of leukocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, nearly all cases of low white blood cells (leukopenia) manifest as neutropenia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;1800/microL</span> &ndash; Calculated as the total white blood <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> x (percent [polymorphonuclear cells + bands] &divide; 100) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-absolute-neutrophil-count\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelets &ndash; Platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL</span></p><p/><p>Threshold levels for normal values may differ depending on age, sex, and race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-pancytopenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thresholds may also differ depending on the clinical scenario; as an example, different criteria are used to diagnose certain bone marrow failure syndromes (eg, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aplastic anemia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3678681518\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF PANCYTOPENIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematopoiesis (blood cell production) in the healthy adult takes place in the bone marrow, from which mature blood cells migrate into the circulation, spleen, and other sites. The bone marrow is a dynamic organ and a hematopoietic reservoir that responds to ongoing needs for blood cell production. A balance between blood cell production, distribution in other organs, and ongoing cellular destruction (eg, white blood cells fighting infections, platelet consumption in blood clots, cellular senescence) determines the levels of circulating blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-pancytopenia/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>Broadly speaking, pancytopenia may be caused by one or more of the following mechanisms: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">infiltration/replacement</span> &ndash; Such disorders include hematologic malignancies (eg, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes), metastatic cancer, myelofibrosis, and infectious diseases (eg, miliary tuberculosis, fungal infections). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow aplasia &ndash; Nutritional disorders (eg, deficiencies of vitamin B12 or folate), aplastic anemia, infectious diseases (eg, HIV, viral hepatitis, parvovirus B19), immune destruction, and medications are among the causes of marrow aplasia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood cell destruction or sequestration &ndash; Excessive blood cell destruction occurs in disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, and ineffective hematopoiesis (eg, myelodysplastic syndromes, megaloblastic disorders), while excessive sequestration may be due to hypersplenism (eg, from liver cirrhosis, storage diseases, lymphoma, or autoimmune disorders). </p><p/><p>Some diseases may cause pancytopenia by multiple mechanisms. As an example, a lymphoma may infiltrate the bone marrow, cause hypersplenism, induce immune destruction of blood cells, and require treatment with cytotoxic agents. Similarly, Crohn disease may impair absorption of iron, folate, and vitamin B12; induce an inflammatory state that exacerbates anemia; require partial bowel resection that affects absorption of nutrients and calories; and require treatment with myelosuppressive agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1287772966\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF PANCYTOPENIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examples of causes of pancytopenia are categorized in the table by the predominant mechanism(s) of cytopenia; because some diseases act by more than one mechanism, certain disorders are listed more than once (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F112134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112134 \">table 1</a>). <em> </em></p><p>Some patients have more than one cause of pancytopenia. Treatment of a disorder that causes pancytopenia (eg, chemotherapy for an underlying lymphoma) may further exacerbate cytopenias. </p><p>The likely causes of pancytopenia are influenced by geography, socioeconomic conditions, and endemic illnesses. As examples, the likelihood of infectious (eg, malaria, tuberculosis, leishmaniasis) or nutritional causes (eg, folate deficiency) of pancytopenia may be increased in some resource-constrained settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-pancytopenia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Similarly, the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and alcohol use may influence the likely causes of pancytopenia. </p><p>The vast majority of pancytopenia in adults is caused by acquired disorders; rarely, a previously unrecognized inborn error may account for cytopenias that are first detected in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-pancytopenia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

It is especially important in patients for whom a primary hematologic disorder is suspected as the cause of pancytopenia (eg, acute leukemia, aplastic anemia, multiple myeloma) or when the cause of pancytopenia remains elusive after the initial evaluation. The urgency of a bone marrow biopsy is influenced by the likely cause(s) of pancytopenia, as well as the severity and trajectory of cytopenias, clinical stability, medical complications, and the need for urgent treatment, as discussed in sections below. (See <a href=\"#H1081877583\" class=\"local\">'Specific clinical scenarios'</a> below.) </p><p>However, in certain situations, a bone marrow biopsy may be unhelpful or even distracting and confounding. As an example, a bone marrow biopsy performed just days after discontinuation of a suspect medication may show a &quot;maturation arrest&quot; (ie, recovery of bone marrow cells only up to an immature stage of differentiation) that may be morphologically indistinguishable from acute leukemia. Similarly, recent treatment with recombinant hematopoietic growth factors may induce a bone marrow morphology that is indistinguishable from certain myeloproliferative neoplasms or inflammatory conditions. In such situations it may be preferable to delay the biopsy by days to weeks. </p><p>Bone marrow biopsies may also be uninformative in some cases when pancytopenia is thought to be due to peripheral blood cell destruction or sequestration (eg, suspected thrombocytopenic purpura, cirrhosis with hypersplenism); clinical evaluation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other specialized testing is generally more useful and definitive in such cases. </p><p>The hematologist who will perform the procedure should communicate with a laboratory technician <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pathologist to properly prepare the specimens (eg, place fresh aspirate material in appropriate anticoagulated medium for flow cytometry or molecular studies, and put biopsy specimens in proper fixative), and to order the appropriate tests. </p><p>The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens will undergo microscopic examination by a hematopathologist, pathologist, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematologist; review by both the pathologist and involved clinicians can be invaluable in interpreting the bone marrow morphology in the context of the clinical presentation.

This decision will be influenced by the severity of the cytopenias, the trajectory of the blood counts, clinical symptoms, and the reason why the medication is being administered. </p><p>For cytotoxic or myelosuppressive agents, blood count recovery can generally be expected within days to weeks. When such drugs are thought to be the cause of pancytopenia, it may be preferable to observe the blood counts for one or two weeks rather than immediately performing a bone marrow biopsy. </p><p>When an idiosyncratic reaction is a likely cause of pancytopenia, a response to discontinuing the medication is less predictable and recovery of blood counts may be protracted. The clinical presentation and the appearance of the bone marrow in such situations may be indistinguishable from idiopathic aplastic anemia. The clinician&rsquo;s judgment is needed to distinguish between these diagnostic possibilities, since confirmatory tests are rarely available or conclusive. </p><p>An immediate bone marrow biopsy may not be helpful when a medication is suspected to be the cause of pancytopenia. A finding of aplasia or hypoplasia will not confirm the identity or nature of the etiologic agent. Additionally, if a biopsy is performed early in the recovery process, the bone marrow may erroneously suggest an acute leukemia, because the recovering cells may exhibit a &ldquo;maturation arrest&rdquo; as hematopoiesis has only progressed to an immature stage of maturation. In such a clinical setting, serial observation of the patient and blood counts may be the most useful diagnostic approach.</p><p>Mechanisms of drug-associated cytopenias include allergic reactions that affect bone marrow production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increase peripheral destruction, and pseudo-allergic reactions. Allergic reactions may be influenced by the patient&rsquo;s immunologic background (ie, HLA type), comorbid conditions, pharmacogenomic constitution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-pancytopenia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], prior exposure to that medication or related drugs, and other clinical features. Exposure to some drugs can induce a hypoproliferative pancytopenia that may be indistinguishable from idiopathic aplastic anemia; recovery of blood counts during a period of observation after discontinuing the suspect medication, if clinically reasonable, may help to distinguish between these diagnoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F112133\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112133 \">table 3</a>).

In such a setting, it is important to identify reversible or treatable causes of cytopenias. As examples, treatment of vitamin deficiencies, discontinuation of suspect medications, and identification of other treatable conditions should be a high priority in evaluating and managing patients with multifactorial pancytopenia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2109699438\"><span class=\"h3\">Other patient scenarios</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The scenarios presented above offer a starting point for the evaluation of pancytopenia in many patients. The pace of diagnostic evaluation will be influenced by the severity and trajectory of the cytopenias and the patient&rsquo;s clinical status (eg, presence of medical emergencies, clinical stability, and associated symptoms). </p><p>Relatively stable patients with mild cytopenias may undergo an outpatient diagnostic work-up with serial evaluation of blood counts. If the counts decline, complications of cytopenias develop, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the evaluation is unrevealing, bone marrow examination should be considered. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Young patient with mild cytopenias</strong> &ndash; A younger adult with mild, asymptomatic pancytopenia may have no definitive clinical findings to suggest the cause of the cytopenias. The history may reveal family members with autoimmune conditions, thyroid disease, or pernicious anemia, and the patient may have vague musculoskeletal symptoms, but does not meet diagnostic criteria for an autoimmune disorder. In some such cases, this may represent a &quot;forme fruste&quot; of an autoimmune disorder and the cytopenias may be identified before other manifestations of the disorder. In others, the cytopenias may reflect recovery from a viral infection or reaction to a medication. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A bone marrow biopsy may not be helpful in this setting, as no diagnostic abnormalities may be identified, unless there is suspicion of an associated immune disorder or lymphoma. Such an asymptomatic patient with mild pancytopenia may have serial outpatient evaluation of complete blood counts and a review of the peripheral blood smear and be counseled about monitoring symptoms; the case should be discussed with a hematologist if there is uncertainty over the urgency of referral.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adult presentation of inborn abnormalities</strong> &ndash; Rare patients will present with late onset congenital disorders. The patient may have had mild, longstanding cytopenias that were not evaluated or for which initial diagnostic testing was unrevealing. In some cases, findings that were previously dismissed (eg, premature graying of the hair, abnormalities of fingernails or skeleton) may be related to an underlying congenital abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-pancytopenia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Monocytopenia, recurrent viral infections, disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infections, opportunistic fungal infections, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and primary lymphedema may suggest GATA2 deficiency.
