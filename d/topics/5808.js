A thrombus may develop in the left ventricle (LV), left atrium (LA), or on a prosthetic valve. Additionally, systemic venous thrombi may paradoxically embolize in patients with right-to-left intracardiac shunting.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricle &ndash; Thrombi in the LV can occur in patients with a myocardial infarction (usually anteroapical), resulting in severe hypokinesis, akinesis, or <span class=\"nowrap\">dyskinesis/aneurysm</span> of the corresponding wall segments and reduced LV systolic function. In addition, patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy (ischemic or non-ischemic) and severely reduced LV systolic function may rarely develop thrombus in the LV.

The vast majority of myxomas present in the LA attached to the interatrial septum, while papillary fibroelastomas are typically found on the aortic or mitral valves.

In most patients, TEE yields higher quality images and has a greater sensitivity and specificity than TTE for common sources of embolism, but a few conditions (eg, left ventricular thrombus) are better seen on TTE. However, because it is less invasive and readily available in most institutions, TTE is often reasonable as the initial test of choice, and in patients with adequate imaging windows, TTE can have a sensitivity and specificity approaching that of TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

LAA thrombi are also reported in patients with cardiac amyloid due to the associated LA mechanical dysfunction despite apparent sinus rhythm.

TEE offers detailed visualization of the LA, including the LAA, which is the main site of thrombus formation in patients with AF or mitral stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56080\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56080 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66795\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef66795 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75036\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef75036 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81863\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81863 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73470\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73470 \">movie 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51472\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51472 \">movie 5</a>). In one intraoperative study, for example, TEE was compared with direct visualization of LA contents at surgery; the sensitivity and specificity of TEE for thrombi were 100 and 99 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. By comparison, conventional two-dimensional TTE has a sensitivity of only 39 to 65 percent for LA thrombi due to poor visualization of the LAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous echo contrast seen during echocardiography is believed to represent erythrocyte aggregation in low shear rate conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Spontaneous echo contrast is most commonly seen in the LA and LAA on TEE, but it may also be seen in the left ventricle on TTE with the use of high frequency transducers.</p><p>Spontaneous echo contrast or &quot;smoke-like&quot; echoes seen within the LA during TEE is a common finding among patients referred for evaluation of a possible cardiac source of embolism, especially in those with AF or LA enlargement, and should raise concern about the possibility of an underlying thrombus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73470\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73470 \">movie 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51472\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51472 \">movie 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56080\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56080 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66795\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef66795 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66980\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66980 \">image 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Its appearance is highly variable and can be accentuated or minimized depending on the gain settings used while imaging.</p><p>There is a very strong association between LA spontaneous echo contrast and LAA thrombus. Among patients with AF and LA thrombi, for example, spontaneous echo contrast is seen in almost 80 percent of cases. This finding is an independent predictor of thromboembolic risk and, in patients with AF, is associated with an increase in embolic rate from 3 to 12 percent per year. Mitral regurgitation appears to lessen the frequency of spontaneous echo contrast. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Left ventricular thrombi</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left ventricular (LV) thrombus is one of the complications of myocardial infarction, usually involving the anteroapical region. TTE can document LV wall motion abnormalities that may underlie thrombus, the presence of thrombus, and risk factors for embolization. The use of TTE with an endocardial border definition contrast agent can also be helpful in identifying thrombus in patients with difficult imaging windows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F85959\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef85959 \">movie 6</a>). One limitation of TEE is difficulty in imaging the LV apex. As a result, TTE is generally preferred for the assessment of LV systolic function and identification of LV apical thrombi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51575\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51575 \">movie 7</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. For patients with suboptimal TTE even with an endocardial contrast agent, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with gadolinium contrast should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Issues related to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of LV thrombus are discussed in detail separately.

When an infectious vegetation is suspected, the risk of subsequent embolization is related to vegetation size and mobility, although echocardiography is relatively poor at predicting risk of embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), or marantic endocarditis, refers to a spectrum of lesions ranging from microscopic aggregates of platelets to large vegetations on the heart valves (most often aortic and mitral), usually in patients with advanced malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonbacterial-thrombotic-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We begin with TTE in patients with suspected endocarditis and native heart valves because it is less invasive than TEE. However, TTE has relatively low sensitivity in infective endocarditis. Thus, a negative study does not preclude the diagnosis and should be followed by TEE, which has superior spatial resolution and improved image quality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73652\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73652 \">movie 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52651\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef52651 \">movie 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65848\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef65848 \">movie 10</a>) in moderate or high risk patients.</p><p>As an example, one prospective study of 96 patients with suspected endocarditis reported a sensitivity for the detection of vegetations of 100 percent with TEE compared with 63 percent with TTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a second report, TTE and TEE were compared in 66 episodes of suspected endocarditis; TEE had a sensitivity of 94 percent versus 44 percent with TTE. Both methods had specificity (the likelihood of a negative result in a patient without the disease) approaching 100 percent, indicating very few false positives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Thus, a negative study indicates a low probability of disease. </p><p>Mobile, filamentous echo densities (sometimes referred to as Lambl's excrescences) have been described on native aortic and mitral leaflets and on prosthetic valves among patients (especially elderly adults) who undergo TEE for indications other than &quot;source of embolism&quot; or &quot;endocarditis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. These echo filamentous densities are felt to represent fibrin strands. An increased prevalence of these thread-like echo densities has been described in patients with a recent cerebral ischemic event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Similar TEE findings have been described on apparently normal functioning prosthetic valves in the absence of an embolic history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Prosthetic valve sources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombus formation and subsequent embolization are common in patients with mechanical valve prostheses, especially in those with a mitral or tricuspid prosthesis and suboptimal anticoagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64234\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64234 \">movie 11</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with prosthetic valves are also at risk for infectious endocarditis with vegetations as well as pannus formation on the prosthesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy for prosthetic heart valves: Indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation of prosthetic valves, especially mitral and tricuspid prostheses, is best performed by TEE because of the orientation of the valve relative to the imaging probe, which eliminates interference from reverberations off of the metallic valve. Aortic and pulmonic prostheses often require a combination of both TTE and TEE to comprehensively assess the valve. In patients with a prosthetic heart valve, unless another source is identified, the valve must be considered the presumed embolic source even if imaging does not demonstrate residual thrombus. The risk of thrombus formation on prosthetic valves is high, particularly if there have been periods of suboptimal anticoagulation.

While there are a variety of ways to classify intracardiac masses, we generally divide the masses into two main categories: thrombus and non-thrombotic masses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98176\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98176 \">table 1</a>).

In most patients, TEE yields higher quality images and has a greater sensitivity and specificity than TTE, but a few conditions (eg, left ventricular thrombus) are better seen on TTE or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). However, because it is less invasive and readily available in most institutions, TTE is often reasonable as the initial test of choice, and in patients with adequate imaging windows, TTE can have a sensitivity and specificity approaching that of TEE. For patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction with suboptimal TTE with subendocardial contrast agent, a CMR imaging study with gadolinium contrast should be considered.
