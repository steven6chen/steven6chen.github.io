It is now the accepted term in the pediatric nephrology community, replacing the clinical terms of chronic renal failure (CRF) and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), which describe renal dysfunction of varying degrees from severe to mild in nature. CKD more clearly defines renal dysfunction as a continuum, rather than a discrete change in renal function, and will be used throughout this topic review.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of CKD in children will be reviewed here. The etiology, epidemiology, natural course, and management of CKD in children are discussed separately.

The KDIGO classification includes etiology, renal function based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and the presence and rate of albumin urinary excretion.</p><p>The KDIGO diagnosis of pediatric CKD is based on fulfilling <strong>one</strong> of the following clinical criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GFR of less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> for greater than three months with implications for health regardless of whether other CKD markers are present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GFR greater than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> that is accompanied by evidence of structural damage or other markers of functional kidney abnormalities including proteinuria, albuminuria, renal tubular disorders, or pathologic abnormalities detected by histology or inferred by imaging.</p><p/><p>The KDIGO guideline also includes CKD staging for children older than two years of age, which stratifies the risk for progression of CKD and its complications based on GFR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89808\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89808 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>G1 &minus; Normal GFR (&ge;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>G2 &minus; GFR between 60 and 89 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>G3a &minus; GFR between 45 and 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>G3b &minus; GFR between 30 and 44 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>G4 &minus; GFR between 15 and 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>G5 &minus; GFR of less than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (kidney failure)</p><p/><p>In adults, the rate of albumin excretion is also included in the staging of CKD based on data that correlates the level of albuminuria to outcome. However, similar data are lacking in children. As a result, albuminuria is not used to classify pediatric CKD.</p><p>Children under two years of age do not fit within the above classification system because they normally have a low GFR even when corrected for body surface area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116099 \">table 2</a>). In these patients, calculated GFR based upon serum creatinine can be compared with normative age-appropriate values to detect kidney impairment.

Patients with non-glomerular causes of CKD may have the following presentation if they are not diagnosed in early childhood:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyuria may be an early presenting finding because many congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (eg, obstructive uropathy), inherited disorders (eg, nephronophthisis), and tubulointerstitial disorders are associated with reduced concentrating ability (ie, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). In these conditions, the impairment in renal concentration capacity generally precedes a significant reduction in GFR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevation in the serum creatinine concentration for age. Patients with spina-bifida and neurogenic bladder may be at risk for under diagnosis of CKD because an associated reduction in muscle mass results in lower creatinine levels that overestimates GFR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor growth is a common manifestation of CKD in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Of the 7037 patients with baseline height measurements registered into the chronic renal insufficiency database of the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) from 1994 to 2008, the mean height and weight were 1.44 and 0.88 standard deviations below age- and gender-specific normal values, respectively. These patients had a mean serum creatinine of 2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (range 1.5 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> with a mean estimated GFR by the Jaffe-based Schwartz formula of 39 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.

These symptoms (referred to as symptoms of uremia) include anorexia, vomiting, weakness, and easy fatigability. Complications attributable to the uremic state include pericarditis, deficits in neurocognitive function, and mineral bone disorder.

Sodium and intravascular volume balance are usually maintained via homeostatic mechanisms until the GFR falls below 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. However, the patient with mild to moderate CKD, despite being in relative volume balance, is less able to respond to rapid infusions of sodium and is, therefore, prone to fluid overload.</p><p>As the kidney function becomes severely impaired (ie, GFR category G4 and G5), water retention may result in volume overload. In some cases, especially with an acute water load, hyponatremia and hypertension may occur as a consequence of fluid retention.

In addition, there is a reduction in both titratable acid excretion (primarily as phosphate) and bicarbonate reabsorption.

Of note, the normative values based upon age may result in over-reporting of small kidneys based on age in children with CKD who may suffer growth impairment, because kidney size is related to the child's height.

Abnormalities in these assessments may not be readily apparent during the early stages of CKD, but will become increasingly prevalent as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases. Whereas there is no single pattern of laboratory abnormalities that characterize pediatric CKD, there are some abnormalities that are commonly present and are indicative of underlying chronic kidney dysfunction, as discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum creatinine and GFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum creatinine is the most commonly used test to estimate the GFR. Developed in the 1970s, the Schwartz formula has been the method used most often to estimate GFR in children and adolescents.</p><p>The original formula was based upon serum creatinine determined by the Jaffe method, height, and an age-based constant k that varied with age (and in adolescents the gender of the patient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>] (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-glomerular-filtration-rate-estimate-for-children-by-schwartz-formula\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>).</p><p> &#160;GFR = k X Height (cm) <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> Screat (Jaffe method)</p><p>Height represents the body height measured in centimeters, and Screat is the serum creatinine value in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> as determined by the Jaffe method. The constant k is directly proportional to the muscle component of body, and varies with age.

The enzymatic method for creatinine determination results in a lower value of creatinine compared with the older Jaffe method, which results in the Schwartz formula generally overestimating the GFR compared with measured values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>].</p><p>The Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study has developed a bedside formula based upon serum creatinine measured by the enzymatic method.

Additional validation studies are required to determine whether the use of this formula can be used in children without CKD.</p><p>Cystatin C, a protease inhibitor produced by all nucleated cells, has been investigated as an alternative biomarker of kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. It is freely filtered at the glomerulus, then reabsorbed and catabolized by the proximal tubule; thus not a classic marker of GFR.

Data from these studies may be useful in providing a diagnosis for the cause of CKD and guiding therapeutic choices.
