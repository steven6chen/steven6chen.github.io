Patients with FS are at substantially increased risk for recurrent and severe bacterial infections. Medications that raise the granulocyte count may provide therapeutic benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-therapy-in-feltys-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but the risk of infection is also affected by granulocyte dysfunction and other disease-related factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-therapy-in-feltys-syndrome/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Treatments for the granulocytopenia of FS include selected nonbiologic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which are presumed to reverse underlying abnormalities in the immune and reticuloendothelial systems. Other medical therapies for FS, including granulocytopoietic growth factors, increase circulating neutrophils by mechanisms that are not disease-specific. Splenectomy is reserved primarily to treat patients with severe granulocytopenia and recurrent infections who are refractory to medical therapy.</p><p>Drug therapy for FS is described here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of FS and the indications for splenectomy in the treatment of FS are discussed separately.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity may also improve with many of these therapies independently of any change in the white blood cell count. A response to therapy is characterized by an increased granulocyte count accompanied by a clinical response that can include reductions in the frequency of infections and other clinical features.

The principal treatment interventions include nonpharmacologic measures to reduce the risk of infection and medications to control RA disease activity and alleviate the granulocytopenia.

The precautions, administration, and dosing are the same as in patients without FS. The dose should be increased to maximum tolerated levels up to 25 mg once weekly in patients not responding to lower doses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We do not limit the dose of MTX based upon the presence of neutropenia. However, in patients with neutropenia, we monitor complete blood counts and absolute neutrophil counts frequently (eg, monthly) in addition to routine drug safety monitoring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Monitoring and reevaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with inadequate control of disease activity (moderate or severe disease activity) and continued granulocytopenia after two months of MTX therapy at maximum tolerated doses of up to 25 mg weekly (administered by subcutaneous injection) are considered inadequately responsive to MTX therapy.

Low-dose weekly oral pulse therapy results in improvement of both articular disease and neutropenia in most patients, often within one to two months. Short-term experience suggests that the frequency of infection may also decrease. However, these encouraging results are based upon small numbers of patients in each report. In one study, seven patients with FS received MTX at a mean dose of 13 mg per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-therapy-in-feltys-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The mean granulocyte count rose insignificantly after one month but doubled after a year. However, since that case series in 1998, no reports of larger series of FS patients treated with MTX and followed for longer than one year have been published.

The precautions, administration, and dosing of leflunomide are the same as in patients without FS. There is very limited evidence regarding its efficacy specifically for FS.

However, other cases of FS have been described in which only articular disease, but not neutropenia, improved following a course of intravenous RTX treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-therapy-in-feltys-syndrome/abstract/12,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20</a>].</p><p>We prefer RTX and other selected agents over a TNF inhibitor because of the lack of efficacy of TNF inhibitors for FS that has been described in case reports.

Glucocorticoids may also be useful for short-term bridging therapy until a patient responds to one of the potentially effective DMARDs, such as MTX or RTX. Typical dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is 30 to 40 mg daily, which is then gradually tapered once the granulocytopenia improves. The rate by which the prednisone dose is tapered to 10 mg daily, or less, depends upon the timing and degree of clinical response and the patient&rsquo;s comorbidities.

The white blood cell count may begin to rise within several weeks of initiating glucocorticoid therapy in responders.</p><p>Glucocorticoids can raise the granulocyte count in FS, both by an immunosuppressive action and by altering granulocyte kinetics: the bone marrow is stimulated to release mature cells, granulocytes are mobilized from the marginal pool, and egress of cells into tissues is impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-therapy-in-feltys-syndrome/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> dosed at 30 mg daily or higher, often can normalize the granulocyte count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-therapy-in-feltys-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, this effect usually is not sustained when the dose is reduced to that usually used as maintenance treatment (less than 10 mg daily) of RA, unless other treatments are added.</p><p>Concern about overwhelming infection is the main obstacle to using high-dose glucocorticoids in FS. Low doses of glucocorticoids, which still may increase the risk of infection, do not consistently improve the granulocyte count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-therapy-in-feltys-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2575386261\"><span class=\"h4\">Role of other biologic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients intolerant of MTX or in those with an inadequate response to MTX and RTX and who require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at doses greater than 10 to 15 mg daily for control of arthritis and granulocytopenia, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a>, rather than a TNF inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tofacitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tofacitinib</a>.

As an example, the benefits and adverse reactions associated with prolonged G-CSF therapy were reported in one study of eight patients with FS who were treated with G-CSF because of recurrent infections or before joint surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-therapy-in-feltys-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Significant side effects occurred in five of the eight patients, including nausea, malaise, and exacerbation of joint pain and vasculitic skin lesions. However, only two of these five required discontinuation of G-CSF, whereas the other three individuals continued G-CSF treatment at reduced doses. The underlying arthritis was not exacerbated. Several reports of individual cases and other small case series with short-term follow-up also support its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-therapy-in-feltys-syndrome/abstract/30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-35</a>].</p><p>Both granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and G-CSF effectively reverse granulocytopenia and reduce infectious complications in many patients. However, some patients do not respond at all to colony-stimulating factor treatment, and secondary treatment failures also have been reported. The incidence of these events is unknown. In addition, cost is often a limiting factor, particularly with extended use. Significant adverse effects with these agents include arthralgias, rarely with exacerbation of synovitis, and the development of leukocytoclastic vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-therapy-in-feltys-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Although some patients have been treated with G-CSF for an extended duration, the colony-stimulating factors are employed primarily for short-term use during periods of neutropenia with active infection.

Two patients with FS, who were unable to continue MTX therapy because of toxicity, experienced resolution of neutropenia when treated with HCQ 400 mg daily. However, each patient required concomitant therapy with glucocorticoids to control articular disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-therapy-in-feltys-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

However, this complication does not appear to occur more frequently in FS than in other patients with RA. The use and adverse effects of gold therapy for RA are described separately.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity may also improve with many of these therapies independently of any change in the white blood cell count. A response to therapy is characterized by an increased granulocyte count accompanied by a clinical response that can include reductions in the frequency of infections and other clinical features. (See <a href=\"#H685090\" class=\"local\">'Goals of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of FS is indicated in patients with recurring or severe infections, although the presence of FS can also impact the choice of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with active RA but without infections. The principal treatment interventions include nonpharmacologic measures to reduce the risk of infection and medications to control RA disease activity and alleviate the granulocytopenia. (See <a href=\"#H685425\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with active RA and FS who have recurrent or severe infections, we suggest initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) rather than another DMARD. We use the same dosing as in patients without FS, and the dose should be increased to maximum tolerated levels up to 25 mg once weekly in patients not responding to lower doses.

TNF inhibitors are avoided as they have been found ineffective treatment for FS. The precautions, administration, and dosing for RTX are the same as in patients without FS.

Glucocorticoids may also be useful for short-term bridging therapy until a patient responds to one of the potentially effective DMARDs, such as MTX or RTX. Typical dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is 30 to 40 mg daily, which is then gradually tapered once the granulocytopenia improves.
