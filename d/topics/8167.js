The risk of perinatally- or neonatal-acquired infection, and its clinical manifestations and implications vary depending on the hepatotropic virus, and are reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a nonenveloped 27-nm RNA virus that is a member of the Picornaviridae family. The virus is transmitted by person-to-person contact through fecal-oral contamination. The infection is highly contagious, and epidemics frequently result from common exposure to contaminated food and water. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatitis-a-virus-infection-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatitis A virus infection in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-virus-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis A virus infection in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361890862\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361890869\"><span class=\"h3\">Maternal vertical transmission</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361891101\"><span class=\"h4\">Intrauterine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the most part, HAV infection is self-limiting in pregnant women. Although maternal HAV infection does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations, stillbirths, intrauterine growth restriction, or spontaneous abortions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], there is an increased risk of preterm labor and premature rupture of membranes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intercurrent hepatobiliary disease during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Hepatitis A'</a>.)</p><p>Although rare, two cases of intrauterine transmission of HAV in early pregnancy were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These cases presented with fetal ascites and meconium peritonitis. After delivery, serologic testing confirmed HAV infection in both infants who required surgical intervention for meconium peritonitis. Their subsequent recovery was uneventful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361891107\"><span class=\"h4\">Perinatal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several case reports of vertical transmission of HAV weeks before or at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. For most of these infants, vertical transmission was identified when the infant presented with hepatitis after the newborn period. Despite these reports, it appears that the risk of perinatal transmission is low given the widespread global distribution of HAV infection.</p><p>In addition, there is no evidence that hepatitis A is transmitted through breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361890876\"><span class=\"h3\">Acquired neonatal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal-acquired HAV infection is rare. There are reported neonatal cases of HAV due to transfusion of contaminated blood or fresh frozen plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], and horizontal transmission from healthcare personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. In an outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Hawaii, 13 infants, 22 NICU nurses, 8 other staff, and 4 household contacts were identified with HAV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Two infants, who received blood transfusions from a donor with HAV infection, were identified as the primary cases and served as a common source of infection for the other infants and staff.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most newborn infants with HAV infection are asymptomatic, symptomatic cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/6,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,13</a>]. In one case series of six infants ranging from two weeks to eight months, all of the patients presented with loss of appetite and jaundice, and in four patients, elevated temperature and recurrent vomiting were also observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. During the course of the disease, all six infants developed hepatomegaly and biochemical evidence of mild hepatitis. All infants had complete clinical and biochemical recovery three months after the acute disease with no long-term sequelae.

Affected newborns remain asymptomatic, and develop chronic antigenemia with mild and often persistent liver enzyme elevations beginning at two to six months of age (immune tolerant phase) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64996 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/1,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,17</a>]. A small number of patients will develop acute hepatitis by two months of age and present with icteric, and occasionally fulminant, hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Most patients develop chronic infection, which may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Infection of an infant with HBV due to vertical transmission from an HBV-infected mother is most commonly diagnosed by the presence of HBsAg by one to two months of age. HBsAg may be transiently positive in neonates up to 21 days following hepatitis B vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Testing for HBV DNA is not recommended for screening, because this test may remain positive for months or years after clearance of HBV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy#H182095830\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Mother-to-child transmission'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important strategies to prevent HBV infection in children are universal HBV immunization for all infants, and the combination of immunoprophylaxis (HBIG) and HBV immunization for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. &#160; &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2683778443\"><span class=\"h3\">Universal immunization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Universal hepatitis B virus immunization is recommended for all infants. The optimal intervals and need for HBIG are determined by the mother's HBsAg status and the infant's birth weight.

As a result, infants of HBsAg-positive mothers should receive monovalent hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG 0.5 mL as soon after delivery as possible (preferably within 12 hours), regardless of birth weight. The schedule for subsequent doses of hepatitis B vaccine depends upon the infant's birth weight. These and other recommendations for immunoprophylaxis and postvaccination testing are discussed in a separate topic review.

In the rare infant with fulminant hepatitis B, off-label use of these compounds (nucleoside analogs) may be considered.</p><p>No specific therapy is generally warranted for infants and children with vertically-transmitted HBV, as patients typically are asymptomatic through infancy and childhood with consistently normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values (immune tolerant). Management for most patients usually involves monitoring for disease progression by laboratory evaluation that includes liver enzyme testing and HBV serology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64996 \">figure 1</a>). Although treatment options are available for children two years or older, these are typically ineffective in children in the immune tolerant phase.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-e-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis E virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Vertical transmission and clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although information regarding perinatal transmission is limited, there are several case series of vertical transmission of HEV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. Affected infants present with signs of hepatitis including jaundice and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, as illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report of eight infants born to mothers infected with HEV in the third trimester, seven infants were born at term, and one was born prematurely at 34 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Anti-HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) was detected in all infants, and HEV RNA was detected in five. One baby was icteric at birth with elevated serum ALT levels, and four were anicteric with elevated ALT levels. Two babies developed hypothermia and hypoglycemia after birth and died within 24 hours. Postmortem liver biopsy on one of these infants revealed massive hepatic necrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report of 19 infants born to HEV-infected mothers, 15 had evidence of vertically-transmitted HEV infection at birth (immunoglobulin M [IgM] anti-HEV positive in 12 and HEV RNA-reactive in 10), and three had short-lasting IgG anti-HEV positivity because of maternal antibody transmission across the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Seven HEV-infected patients had icteric hepatitis, five had anicteric hepatitis, and three had high serum bilirubin with normal liver enzymes. Seven infants died in the first week after birth, including one death due to prematurity. Of the nine survivors with follow-up data, five were HEV RNA-positive. HEV RNA was not detectable by 4 weeks of life in three patients, by 8 weeks in one, and by 32 weeks in the remaining infant. All survivors had self-limited disease. The authors concluded that HEV infection is commonly transmitted from mother to fetus and causes high neonatal mortality. However, HEV infection in survivors is self-limited with short-lasting viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest case series, vertical transmission was observed in 46 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(59/128)</span> of HEV-IgM-positive mothers, and viral load was found to be the most significant predictor for vertical transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-viruses-and-the-newborn-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361893493\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of HEV infection is based upon the detection of HEV in serum or stool by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by the detection of IgM antibodies to HEV.

As a result, infants of HBsAg-positive mothers should receive monovalent Hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG 0.5 mL as soon after delivery as possible (preferably within 12 hours), regardless of birth weight. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-immunization-in-infants-children-and-adolescents#H2018970930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus immunization in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;, section on 'HBsAg-positive mother or mother with other evidence of HBV infection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No specific therapy is generally warranted for the majority of patients with vertically-transmitted HBV, as they remain asymptomatic through childhood with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values (immune tolerant). Management for most patients usually only involves monitoring for disease progression by laboratory evaluation that includes liver enzyme testing and HBV serology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64996 \">figure 1</a>). Children with chronic hepatitis B who develop persistently abnormal ALT values should be referred for consideration of treatment to clinicians with expertise in managing pediatric hepatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis C &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis C'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The risk of vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) from an infected woman to her infant is approximately 5 percent, which increases if the mother is coinfected with HIV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neonatally-acquired HCV is rare. It had been primarily due to transmission through contaminated blood products, but this source has virtually disappeared, as HCV has almost been totally eliminated from the blood supply.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Newborn infants with HCV infection usually are asymptomatic and a significant proportion of patients will have spontaneous resolution of their infection. Some patients progress to chronic infection but most remain asymptomatic throughout childhood. Some children with chronic HCV infection will develop advanced liver disease as adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The diagnosis of HCV is usually made by detecting antibodies to HCV. However, antibody testing of infants of women known to be infected with HCV should be delayed until the maternal antibodies transferred through the placenta are cleared. At our center, we test at-risk infants at 18 months of age. However, others begin testing at an earlier age. (See <a href=\"#H361893224\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No effective intervention has been identified to prevent perinatal transmission.
