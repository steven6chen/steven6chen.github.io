The severity of the pain may range from mild to severe. The pain is frequently related to defecation. While in some patients abdominal pain is relieved with defecation, some patients report worsening of pain with defecation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Bowel movements generally occur during waking hours, most often in the morning or after meals. Most bowel movements are preceded by lower abdominal cramping pain, urgency, and a sensation of incomplete evacuation or tenesmus. Approximately one-half of all patients with IBS complain of mucus discharge with stools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

A clinical diagnosis of IBS requires the fulfillment of symptom-based diagnostic criteria and a limited evaluation to exclude underlying organic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

The most widely used among them are the Rome IV criteria.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rome IV criteria for IBS</strong> &mdash; According to the Rome IV criteria, IBS is defined as recurrent abdominal pain, on average, at least one day per week in the last three months, associated with two or more of the following criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/17,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,26</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Related to defecation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Associated with a change in stool frequency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Associated with a change in stool form (appearance) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>IBS subtypes</strong> &mdash; Subtypes of IBS are recognized based on the patient's reported predominant bowel habit on days with abnormal bowel movements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F108339\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108339 \">figure 1</a>). The Bristol stool form scale (BSFS) should be used to record stool consistency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F108357\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108357 \">figure 2</a>). Subtypes can only confidently be established when the patient is evaluated off medications used to treat bowel habit abnormalities. IBS subtypes are defined for clinical practice as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>IBS with predominant constipation</strong>: Patient reports that abnormal bowel movements are usually constipation (type 1 and 2 in the BSFS)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>IBS with predominant diarrhea</strong>: Patient reports that abnormal bowel movements are usually diarrhea (type 6 and 7 in the BSFS)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>IBS with mixed bowel habits</strong>: Patient reports that abnormal bowel movements are usually both constipation and diarrhea (more than one-fourth of all the abnormal bowel movements were constipation and more than one-fourth were diarrhea)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>IBS unclassified</strong>: Patients who meet diagnostic criteria for IBS but cannot be accurately categorized into one of the other three subtypes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other criteria</strong> &mdash; The Manning criteria include relief of pain with bowel movements, looser and more frequent stools with onset of pain, passage of mucus, and a sense of incomplete emptying (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63034\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63034 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There have been conflicting data regarding the predictive ability of the Manning criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. The Kruis criteria are less frequently used in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. A number of studies have assessed the accuracy of the Rome and Manning criteria in a variety of practice settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. As a result, some investigators continue to use the Manning criteria or a combination of both. No symptom-based criteria have ideal accuracy for diagnosing IBS; however, the Manning and Kruis criteria perform at least as well as the Rome I criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3598501161\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1382979335\"><span class=\"h3\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical history serves to identify clinical manifestations of IBS as well as identify other possible causes of similar symptoms. The BSFS should be used to record stool consistency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F108357\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108357 \">figure 2</a>). We perform a thorough history with particular attention to the symptoms that are concerning for organic disease. The history should include exposure to a variety of medications that can cause similar symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71449 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62307 \">table 3</a>). A subgroup of patients report an acute viral or bacterial gastroenteritis prior to the onset of IBS symptoms. Family history assessment should include the presence of inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and celiac disease. The physical examination is usually normal in patients with IBS. However, patients may have mild abdominal tenderness to palpation. In patients with constipation a rectal examination may be useful in identifying dyssynergic defecation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

However, almost all the studies included in this analysis were conducted outside the United States. A prospective multicenter study performed in the United States compared the prevalence of abnormal celiac antibodies and biopsy proven celiac disease in patients with non-constipated IBS to that of healthy controls. Although more than 7 percent of non-constipated IBS patients had celiac disease associated antibodies suggesting gluten sensitivity, the prevalence of biopsy proven celiac disease was similar to controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

The estimated prevalence of IBS globally is approximately 11 percent with a higher prevalence in younger individuals and in women. (See <a href=\"#H596144478\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain in IBS is usually described as a cramping sensation with variable intensity and periodic exacerbations. The pain is frequently related to defecation. While in some patients abdominal pain is relieved with defecation, a substantial portion of patients report worsening of pain with defecation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Chronic abdominal pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of IBS include diarrhea, constipation, alternating diarrhea and constipation, or normal bowel habits alternating with either diarrhea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> constipation. Diarrhea is usually characterized as frequent loose stools of small to moderate volume. Bowel movements generally occur during waking hours, most often in the morning or after meals. Patients may have constipation with interludes of diarrhea or normal bowel function. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Altered bowel habits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IBS should be suspected in patients with chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (constipation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea). A clinical diagnosis of IBS requires the fulfillment of symptom-based diagnostic criteria and a limited evaluation to exclude underlying organic disease. (See <a href=\"#H3710510959\" class=\"local\">'Overview of diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">According to the Rome IV criteria, IBS is defined as recurrent abdominal pain, on average, at least one day per week in the last three months, associated with two or more of the following criteria (see <a href=\"#H2263560866\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Related to defecation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Associated with a change in stool frequency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Associated with a change in stool form (appearance) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial evaluation in all patients with suspected IBS includes a history and physical examination, and limited testing to evaluate for the presence of alarm features concerning for organic disease. (See <a href=\"#H3598501161\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In all patients with suspected IBS, we perform a complete blood count and age appropriate colorectal cancer screening. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with diarrhea, we perform the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin </p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Serologic testing for celiac disease </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alarm features concerning for underling organic disease include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age of onset after age 50 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rectal bleeding or melena</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nocturnal diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Progressive abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unexplained weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laboratory abnormalities (iron deficiency anemia, elevated C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Family history of inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients who meet diagnostic criteria for IBS and have no alarm features, we do not routinely perform any additional testing beyond the initial evaluation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with alarm features, we perform additional evaluation to exclude other causes of similar symptoms. The diagnostic evaluation is based on the clinical presentation and usually includes endoscopic evaluation in all patients and imaging in selected cases. (See <a href=\"#H3264629736\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation based on the presence of alarm features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with IBS have chronic symptoms that vary in severity over time. Patients may also experience a change in IBS subtype over time with the most frequent change being from predominant constipation or diarrhea to mixed bowel habits.
