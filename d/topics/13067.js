Heavy chain deposition disease and light chain deposition disease are collectively referred to as monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD). A minority of patients has or develops multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-heavy-chain-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The heavy chain diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of these disorders will be reviewed here.

These fibrils have an antiparallel beta-pleated sheet configuration (noted on x-ray diffraction), and can be identified on biopsy specimens both by their characteristic appearance on electron microscopy, and by their ability to bind Congo red (leading to apple green birefringence under polarized light) and thioflavine T (producing an intense yellow-green fluorescence). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic factors in the amyloid diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several forms of amyloidosis with distinct clinical patterns are recognized based on the nature of the precursor protein; the term &quot;primary&quot; amyloidosis refers specifically to the form of amyloidosis in which the precursor proteins are monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains produced by an underlying clonal plasma cell proliferative disorder. However, contemporary nomenclature is AL amyloidosis, in which AL denotes that the amyloid protein is immunoglobulin light chain-derived. In approximately 10 percent of cases the disorder overlaps with overt multiple myeloma.</p><p>In all forms of amyloidosis, the precursor proteins involved undergo transformation (misfolding) to a beta-pleated fibrillar configuration. Many distinct low molecular weight proteins are recognized to form amyloid fibrils.

It is therefore a non-amyloid monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain (usually kappa) deposition disease that is caused by a clonal plasma cell proliferative disorder.</p><p>Patients with LCDD usually present with renal, cardiac, or hepatic involvement and may have underlying multiple myeloma or a lymphoproliferative disorder. In some patients, routine electrophoretic techniques may not demonstrate a monoclonal protein in the serum or urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], but one is often detected using serum free light chain analysis.

With both AL amyloidosis and LCDD, tissue deposits can occur in a variety of organs. These include the kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63840%7ENEPH%2F78183%7ENEPH%2F54148\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63840 graphicRef78183 graphicRef54148 \">picture 1A-C</a>), heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64630\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64630 \">picture 2</a>), liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71088%7ENEPH%2F59302\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71088 graphicRef59302 \">picture 3A-B</a>), and gastrointestinal tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F81003\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81003 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>Bone marrow biopsy in patients with AL amyloidosis usually contains a population of monoclonal plasma cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79371\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79371 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82433\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82433 \">picture 6</a>), expressing either kappa or lambda light chains (but not both), and staining strongly for CD138 and CD32B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similar cells have been found in the spleen of affected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nature of the tissue deposits</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">AL amyloidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fibrils in AL amyloidosis are derived from the fragment, more commonly from the variable region of lambda light chains in approximately 75 percent of cases, and kappa in the remainder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Deposition of the variable region explains why immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-lambda and anti-kappa light chain antibodies is often only weakly positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>]. Two characteristics of these deposits are their fibrillar nature on electron microscopy, and their ability to bind Congo red (leading to green birefringence under polarized light) and thioflavine-T (producing an intense yellow-green fluorescence) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63840%7ENEPH%2F78183%7ENEPH%2F54148\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63840 graphicRef78183 graphicRef54148 \">picture 1A-C</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Amyloid fibrils also bind serum amyloid P (SAP) component; this has led to the evaluation of the use of radiolabeled SAP to detect tissue amyloid deposits noninvasively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Light chain deposition disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In comparison to AL amyloidosis, the tissue deposits in LCDD are almost always composed of kappa light chains; they are granular not fibrillar, and do not bind Congo red, thioflavine-T, or SAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/5-7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,23</a>]. Furthermore, the constant region of the immunoglobulin is typically deposited in this disorder. As a result, immunofluorescence microscopy is typically strongly positive for the monoclonal light chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/7,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,24</a>]. As with AL amyloidosis, LCDD may be associated with multiple myeloma or other conditions, such as lymphoma or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].</p><p>In the kidney, LCDD is often associated with deposits in the tubular basement membranes and Bowman's capsule that may be more prominent than those in the glomeruli (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52620%7ENEPH%2F73654%7ENEPH%2F61886\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52620 graphicRef73654 graphicRef61886 \">picture 7A-C</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The clinical presentation varies in part with the site of deposition. Patients with predominant glomerular deposition may present with nephrotic syndrome (similar to AL amyloidosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], while those with predominant tubular deposition may present with renal insufficiency and relatively mild proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In one series, patients with LCDD had, at the time of renal biopsy, a higher plasma creatinine concentration (5.1 versus 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [451 versus 212 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> and a lower rate of protein excretion (3.7 versus 6.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> than patients with AL amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Determinants of tissue deposits</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">AL amyloidosis and LCDD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is unclear what factors determine whether fibrillar or granular deposits will occur with a given monoclonal light chain. It is likely that the biochemical characteristics of the light chain are an important determinant of toxicity. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the infusion of monoclonal light chains from affected patients into mice produces the same renal disease (cast nephropathy, amyloid deposition, or lack of disease) in the mouse as was seen in the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Furthermore, the light chains in AL amyloidosis, light chain deposition disease and myeloma cast nephropathy have been demonstrated to cause different transformations of human mesangial cells in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>One property that appears to be important is the ability of the light chain to self-associate and form high molecular weight aggregates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. These aggregates in vivo would then lead to tissue deposits with or without fibril formation in AL amyloidosis and light chain deposition disease, respectively, or to cast formation in myeloma kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In vitro studies suggest that the amino acid composition at specific sites <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the net charge of the protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] may be an important determinant of amyloidogenic potential. Certain amino acids may facilitate unfolding of the light chain, which increases the likelihood of forming tissue aggregates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In contrast, the affinity of binding to Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein may be a determinant of the likelihood of developing cast nephropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies#H3450337306\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiology of kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies&quot;, section on 'Intratubular cast formation'</a>.)</p><p>Differences in the variable region of the monoclonal light chain in AL amyloidosis also may determine the sites of tissue deposition. This was illustrated in studies from two medical centers of a total of 97 patients with AL amyloidosis in whom the clonal sequence and germline donor patterns for the immunoglobulin lambda light chain variable region (Ig V lambda) were determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Patients whose clones derived from the V lambda VI donor uniformly presented with dominant renal involvement, while those with V lambda II or V lambda III donors tended to have dominant cardiac or other (eg, soft tissue) organ involvement, respectively. In addition, both early (&lt;3 months) and overall post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survival were significantly better in lambda VI IGLV6S1 patients compared with patients with other V-lambda donors. These findings indicate that there are important associations in AL amyloidosis among Ig V-lambda gene utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/20,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,34</a>], organ-system tropism, and post-HCT survival.</p><p>In addition to the properties of the intact light chain, variations in light chain degradation, either locally or within macrophages, and in the local environment may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/6,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,35,36</a>]. In one study, for example, a urinary paraprotein was isolated from a patient with AL amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In vitro, this Bence Jones protein adopted a fibrillar conformation at acid pH but remained aggregated but not fibrillar at physiologic pH. Such variations in the microenvironment could explain the occasional deposition of both fibrillar and granular deposits in a single patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/6,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,37</a>].</p><p>Differences in light chain metabolism could also explain why the combination of acute renal failure due to myeloma kidney and either AL amyloidosis or LCDD is unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Tubular damage and tubular obstruction in myeloma kidney require the filtration of intact light chains, not the light chain fragments responsible for tissue deposition in amyloidosis or LCDD.</p><p>The availability of amyloidogenic lambda light chain-secreting human cell lines, derived from a patient with AL amyloidosis, should help our understanding of this phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In AL amyloidosis, a population of clonal plasma cells produces monoclonal light chains that form fibrils with a primarily antiparallel &szlig;-pleated sheet configuration that are then deposited in the kidney and other tissues of the vital organs. These deposits can be identified on biopsy specimens both by their characteristic appearance on electron microscopy, and by their ability to bind Congo red (leading to apple green birefringence under polarized light) and thioflavine T (producing an intense yellow-green fluorescence). The fibrils in AL amyloidosis are derived from the variable region of lambda light chains in approximately 75 percent of cases, and kappa in the remainder. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Amyloidosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'AL amyloidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In LCDD, a population of clonal plasma cells produces monoclonal light chain fragments that do not have the necessary biochemical characteristics to form amyloid fibrils, but are deposited as granules in the tissues. In comparison to AL amyloidosis, the tissue deposits in LCDD are almost always composed of kappa light chains; they are granular, not fibrillar, and do not bind Congo red, thioflavine-T, or serum amyloid P component. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Light chain deposition disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Light chain deposition disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In HCDD, a population of clonal plasma cells produces both light and heavy monoclonal immunoglobulin chains or only short (truncated) heavy chains that are unable to form amyloid fibrils, but are deposited as granules in the tissues. HCDD can be readily identified by immunofluorescence staining of biopsy tissue with anti-heavy chain antibodies. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Heavy chain deposition disease and heavy chain (AH) amyloidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is unclear what factors determine whether fibrillar (as seen in AL amyloidosis) or granular (as seen in LCDD) deposits will occur with a given monoclonal light chain. Potential determinants include the biochemical and biophysical characteristics of the light chain and variations in light chain degradation. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'AL amyloidosis and LCDD'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kisilevsky R, Young ID.
