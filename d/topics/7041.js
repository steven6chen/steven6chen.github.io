The way in which family members and significant others respond to the depressed patient, in turn, influences the course and outcome of the depressive episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While many family members cope well when a member becomes depressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], others experience significant distress themselves and inadvertently exacerbate the patient's depression, decrease the likelihood of recovery, and increase the probability of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. It therefore makes good clinical sense to include the family as part of evaluating and treating depressed patients.</p><p>There are psychoeducation, systems, emotion focused, and cognitive-behavioral therapy family therapies. They all share the two-fold aim of modifying negative interactional patterns and promoting supportive aspects of dyadic relationships, to change the interpersonal context linked to depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the use of family assessments and family therapy for treating depression in adult patients.

The clinician can gain collateral information that patients may be withholding intentionally or not. In addition, some patients resist treatment, and clinicians can recruit family members as allies to help overcome this. Family members themselves may be resistant to certain aspects of treatment and encourage noncompliance on the part of the patient (eg, family members may believe that antidepressant medication is addictive).</p><p>Family therapy is most appropriate for families who have pronounced difficulty in dealing with depression in their loved one. Family therapy is particularly indicated in families where <span class=\"nowrap\">marital/family</span> problems predate the onset of the depression, because these families generally have greater difficulties in managing depression in a family member [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Family therapy can address both the preceding problems and the difficulties that a family has in dealing with the depression.</p><p>Family therapy is usually an adjunct to pharmacotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> individual psychotherapy for treating depression. However, family therapy may be indicated as a stand-alone treatment if the depressive syndrome is not severe and occurs in the context of marital or family distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>There are no contraindications to a family assessment or family therapy for adult patients with depression. However, patients must be able to tolerate elicitation of strong affects such as sadness and anxiety, which may occur during treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THEORETICAL FOUNDATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Family dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> marital discord are highly prevalent in families with a depressed member [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One study found that marital distress occurred more often in depressed inpatients (n = 35) than community controls (n = 42) (47 versus 17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Another study that prospectively followed depressed patients (n = 50) and healthy controls matched by age and sex (n = 50) for up to 10 years found that marital relationships were worse in the patient group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Depression is associated with impaired family functioning in different cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Relationship distress and depression interact such that each exacerbates the other. Both depression and family dysfunction tend to be chronic, creating a vicious cycle lasting for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As an example, depressed patients may behave in ways that irritate and alienate family members, eventually leading to rejection of the depressed patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, individuals with depression may also selectively seek negative feedback consistent with their poor self-image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Couple distress can lead to depression through loss of intimacy and emotional connection, combined with tension and interpersonal hostility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. One study found that marital distress was associated with a 10-fold increase in depressive symptoms, and another study found that the risk of major depression was 25 times greater in unhappy marriages compared with untroubled marriages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Conversely, support from a spouse has been shown to decrease the frequency of depression following stressful life events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Family functioning also predicts the course of illness in depressed patients. Interpersonal support, greater intimacy, and help from a partner to improve coping may buffer the effect of depressive symptoms and facilitate recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Conversely, family dysfunction may interfere with recovery from depression; in one study, remission occurred in significantly fewer depressed patients with discord in their intimate relationships, compared to depressed patients without discord (34 versus 61 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other studies have found that family dysfunction is associated with a slower rate of recovery from a depressive episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], and that excessive criticism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> emotional over-involvement within the family increases the likelihood of recurrence following recovery from depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Depression interferes with parenting skills and adversely affects children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young children of depressed parents have more difficult temperaments, more problems with aggression and mood, more insecure attachments, more difficult interpersonal functioning, poor self esteem, and lower academic performance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children of parents with depression have higher rates of internalizing (eg, anxiety and depression) and externalizing (eg, substance use) symptoms and disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The quality of parenting may not improve significantly despite recovery from the depressive episode.</p><p/><p>Although many authorities distinguish couples therapy from family therapy because of theoretical and organizational reasons, we maintain that the principles of treatment are similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Both couples and family therapy focus upon the depressed patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> social connections, as opposed to simply focusing upon the individual patient. The clinician may need to make some technical adjustments depending upon whether the clinician meets with two, three, four or more family members, but the principles of treatment are the same. The main determinate for couple or family approaches is the comfort level of the clinician with smaller or larger numbers of significant others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in treating depressed patients with family therapy is to evaluate the patient and the family together.</p><p>The clinician should assess the nature and quality of the family's relationships to determine whether family therapy is appropriate. Most families do not need family therapy, but all families can benefit from an assessment and opportunity to meet with the treating clinician in order to discuss their concerns, learn more about the illness and available treatments, and to receive support and guidance in how they can help the patient.</p><p>We suggest that all members of the family should be seen at least for the initial evaluation. &quot;Family&quot; means anyone who has a meaningful, emotionally important relationship with the patient. A meaningful relationship is one in which people live together, or see and talk with each other for 10 or more hours per week. After the initial evaluation, decisions can be made about the composition of subsequent meetings for family therapy.</p><p>This initial meeting should be viewed as an evaluation and not a treatment session. The clinician has to be particularly careful to be open to all participants' perspectives of the presenting problems and not to imply blame.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should assess the patient's depression, personality, and social life. This part of the interview overlaps with information collected during the initial interview of the patient alone without the family and may thus be truncated. However, family members often reveal new or contrasting information.</p><p>The patient's specific type of depression should be characterized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is this the first episode or is it a recurrence?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there symptoms of psychosis?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is it chronic?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there any comorbid psychiatric or nonpsychiatric illnesses?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a family history of mood disorders?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What treatments have been tried?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What has been helpful and what has not?</p><p/><p>The patient's personality should be characterized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the person with the depression like?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is his or her temperament?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How is the patient coping with the depression?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the meaning of the depression to the patient?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the depressed patient's conflicts?</p><p/><p>The patient's social life should be characterized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What recent changes occurred in the patient's social situation?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the patient's work situation?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Who are the significant people in this person's life?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the quality of this person's social and family relationships?</p><p/><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of patients with depression is discussed in greater detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Family assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The essential task in meeting with family members for the first time is to evaluate their functioning. The family assessment determines both the need for family therapy and the specific areas of family life that might need to be addressed.</p><p>Data from the family assessment are used to develop a biopsychosocial formulation that addresses both the patient's problems and the social context in which they present. All three factors (biological, psychological, and social) should be considered together in developing a formulation and corresponding treatment plan.</p><p>Assessing and clarifying the family's difficulties can be of significant therapeutic value in and of itself, as it may provide an opportunity for the family to hear each other's concerns in a safe environment in a way that was perhaps not possible up to that point. Families may have been reluctant to express their perspectives to each other for fear of hurting each other's feelings or because of the anger that each may have felt about the burden they have been dealing with.</p><p>A family assessment does not necessarily lead to family therapy. If the family assessment reveals a well functioning family, then reassurance, support, and education can be offered.</p><p>The clinician and family members may be most interested in focusing on the depression, its impact on the family, and what the family should do to be helpful. While these issues are central to working with families of a depressed patient, it is also important to do a more comprehensive family assessment in order to better understand the full range of problems and concerns a family may have, because these concerns may influence the depression even if the family is not aware of these issues. As an example, a depressed woman may have a husband and son who often argue with each other and their conflict may contribute heavily to her depression.</p><p>There are different ways to assess a family and many kinds of information that can be gathered. Some family therapists begin with a long history of the family's life, connections, and evolution as a unit. Other therapists are more interested in a here and now view of how the family functions and current problems with which they are dealing. Still other therapists are focused primarily on the process issues in the family session. All three approaches have merit, are not mutually exclusive, and there is no evidence that one approach is superior to the others.</p><p>It is important for the clinician to establish a connection with the family when meeting with the family for the first time. The family needs to feel understood, respected, and validated. They should not be blamed for their loved one's problems or judged for their perceived deficiencies. Families are more likely to participate openly in the assessment process if they feel comfortable with it.</p><p>One effective way of putting a family at ease is to orient them to the evaluation process at the beginning of the meeting. The orientation explains the purpose of the evaluation, establishes goals for the process, and develops consensus about the agenda. It is important to clarify what the family expects will happen and what they would like to get out of the meeting. The clinician explains that the goal of the meeting is to provide an opportunity for all family members to identify what they see as problems and to bring up any areas of concern. The clinician can then outline his or her expectations from the assessment and map out the process ahead.</p><p>It is most useful to start by asking each family member to identify what they see as the problems in the family. Every person should be given the opportunity to express his or her concerns without being interrupted by others. The challenge for the clinician is to not get sidetracked by beginning therapy to deal with problems before everybody has had an opportunity to present their perspectives. The clinician also has to make sure the problems are not described in such detail as to not leave time for exploration of problems and concerns of other family members.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Family functioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the concerns of each family member have been delineated, the clinician should evaluate the family's overall functioning. The goal is to understand how the family's specific ways of functioning in different spheres of family life contribute to the patient's depression. The clinician should identify potentially dysfunctional transactional patterns, which are repetitive interactional processes that prevent effective resolution of ongoing interpersonal problems.</p><p>There is no &quot;typical&quot; pattern of family dysfunction. Each family attempts to cope with the reality of its depressed member in ways that are unique to the individuals and circumstances that make up that family constellation.</p><p>Several models of family functioning have been described, each focusing on different aspects of family life. At the same time, there is considerable overlap between these approaches.</p><p>One model that provides structure and breadth to the family assessment is the McMaster Model of Family Functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In this model, clinicians systematically assess the following dimensions of family functioning:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problem solving - the family's ability to resolve problems to a level that maintains effective family functioning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communication - the exchange of information within the family.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Roles - the repetitive patterns of behavior by which family members fulfill family functions (eg, household chores, child care responsibilities, finances).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affective responsiveness - whether family members are able to respond to the full spectrum of feelings experienced in the emotional life of each member and whether the emotion experienced is consistent or appropriate with the stimulus or situation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affective involvement - the extent to which the family shows interest in and values the activities of individual family members.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior control - the ways in which a family establishes rules about acceptable behavior relating to physically dangerous situations, psychobiological needs and drives, and social behavior between family members and people outside the family.</p><p/><p>We suggest using the General Functioning Scale of the Family Assessment Device, a self-report measure, to assess these areas of family functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F54714\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54714 \">table 1</a>). Families can fill it out prior to the initial family meeting to establish a baseline, and before each treatment session as an outcome measure to track their progress. The results can be shared with the family to augment the clinician's own evaluation of how well the family is doing.</p><p>Other models of family functioning include the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beavers Systems Model, which identifies family competence and family style as major constructs of how the family is organized and functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumflex Model of Marital and Family Systems focuses on family cohesion, flexibility, and communications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family focused therapy, which prioritizes problem-solving, family organization, and emotional climate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Tools for family assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of instruments allow clinicians to evaluate and quantify family functioning systematically in order to track change over time, compare families, and conduct research.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-report (internal) instruments include the: Family Assessment Device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/28,29,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,33,34</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F54714\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54714 \">table 1</a>), Dyadic Adjustment Scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], Self-report Family Inventory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], Family Environment Scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Self-report instruments provide information about each family member's view of their family functioning. This can be used to help members see and understand differences in each other's point of view. Interviewer-rated assessments are more comprehensive because the rater can include observed family processes. In addition, interviewer-rated assessments provide information about how the family is seen by others, which the clinician can use when giving feedback to the family and helping them decide which problems to address. Thus, each type of assessment complements the other. Interviewer-rated assessments may yield more valid information, but require time from someone on the treatment team.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">General treatment principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Family therapy is defined as any psychotherapeutic endeavor that explicitly focuses on altering interactions between family members and seeks to improve the functioning of the family as a unit, or its subsystems, and the functioning of the individual members of the family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The different types of family therapy include systems, psychoeducation, emotion focused, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.

These specific therapies are described below, with greater attention given to a specific form of systems therapy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Systems therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Psychoeducation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Emotion focused therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The different types of family therapy have all been shown to be effective in the treatment of families with a depressed member [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/6,42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,42-45</a>]. There is no empirical evidence indicating one family therapy is more effective than another. This leads to a dilemma for clinicians trying to determine which family approach to learn and use in particular clinical situations. It makes most sense for a clinician to become competent in one major school of family therapy rather than try to mix ingredients from different models. The selected model of family therapy should be broadly based and well defined so as to allow it to be applied to a wide range of family problems, including families with a depressed patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/26,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,46</a>].</p><p>Common problems that occur in families of depressed patients and can be treated with family therapy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor communication</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of support between family members</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not fulfilling parental roles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor understanding about the nature of depression, the patient's limited capabilities, available treatments, and likely course of illness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blame, criticism, and hostility in response to the depressed patient's social withdrawal, negativity, hopelessness, helplessness, regression, and dependence</p><p/><p>A common challenge is to find a balance between encouraging the patient to take on new responsibilities without discounting the patient's incapacity due to the depression. The clinician, patient, and family members should set goals that are realistic in terms of what functions the depressed patient can manage and what family members can do to support the patient. A better understanding of depression can help the patient and family members determine the patient's realistic capabilities.</p><p>Family therapy meetings generally last from 30 to 60 minutes depending on the stage of treatment. Meetings should initially be held weekly and then with decreasing frequency as the patient and family improve. The number of family meetings range from 1 to more than 20, depending on the type and severity of presenting problems and the specific type of family therapy used.</p><p>The usual format is for a single clinician to treat a single family. However, family therapy can be delivered within a group format, in which one or two clinicians treat up to five depressed patients and their respective families. Multifamily group therapy is effective for providing psychoeducation and decreasing feelings of isolation and hopelessness by sharing information, support, and coping strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Depression is often a chronic and recurring disorder. Thus, patients and other family members need to learn skills to help manage the depressive illness over the patient's lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Family interventions may create problems if the clinician implies that family members and processes caused the patient's depression. Family interventions may also negatively impact well-functioning families if a clinician assumes a causal relationship between normal family problems and the patient's depression, or if a clinician breaches confidentiality by revealing a secret that the depressed patient did not want revealed to other family members.</p><p>Focusing upon emotion laden issues may help some patients, but can also lead to discontinuation of treatment and to marital separations.</p><p>Family therapy can be terminated when the family and clinician agree that the family is dealing with their problems effectively. Family therapy should also be terminated if the patient's and the family's situation is deteriorating or if the family is not committed to the treatment process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common processes and goals in the different effective family therapies are probably more important for treatment outcome than the specific maneuvers of a given school of therapy or of a particular clinician. All of these therapies attempt to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase knowledge about depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease guilt about the illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redefine problems between family members</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase use of adaptive coping mechanisms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encourage appropriate emotional expression and responses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improve communication skills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improve problem-solving skills and parenting skills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clarify boundaries between family members</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Set appropriate boundaries between the familial subsystems and family of origin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promote insight into current transactions and historical factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease conflict</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resolve family-of-origin issues</p><p/><p>The primary challenge for the clinician is to determine the particular needs and goals of any given family and the obstacles that prevent them from achieving those goals. This is most likely to occur by meeting with all available family members to elicit different perspectives of the problem and determine how the family has tried to deal with the problem. Examples of specific goals that the patient and family may desire include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct and clear communication of concerns</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gradually increasing and fuller involvement in necessary family roles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gradually increasing participation in activities outside of the home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater levels of physical activity</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Noncompliance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noncompliance is common in family therapy, similar to other psychosocial and somatic treatments. Various factors need to be evaluated to deal effectively with lack of follow through in completing homework assignments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were the tasks clearly outlined?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were the tasks appropriate to the person's capabilities and schedule?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was there agreement by all family members about their assignments?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the tasks address identified family problems?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was the family motivated and committed to the treatment process?</p><p/><p>The tasks should be renegotiated if noncompliance is related mainly to task assignment and allocation issues. It is this process of negotiating tasks, and evaluating whether patients follow through and the reasons for success and failure, which is the core of the therapeutic work.</p><p>The family should be given the choice of reengaging in or terminating treatment if noncompliance is related to lack of motivation to change, provided the depressed patient is not at acute risk. Families that terminate treatment should be allowed to return when they are ready to participate more actively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Booster sessions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Families should be given the option of &quot;booster,&quot; follow-up sessions once they have completed a successful course of treatment. An initial booster session can be scheduled one to three months later and if they report they are doing well, another one six-months after that. The focus should be on reinforcing gains and helping to solve new problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Systems therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systems is a type of family therapy that views the family as a single system or entity. Systemic models view dysfunctional family relationships as causing or reinforcing symptoms. Systems therapists attempt to restructure maladaptive patterns of family interactions.</p><p>We suggest the Problem Centered Systems Therapy of the Family. This therapy is based upon the McMaster Model of Family Functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Treatment emphasizes changing behavior to resolve problems in family functioning identified during the family assessment. The General Functioning Scale from the Family Assessment Device can be used to assess family functioning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F54714\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54714 \">table 1</a>) and (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Family functioning'</a> above).</p><p>The clinician focuses upon stages of treatment rather than on specific intervention skills:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the patient and family functioning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contracting and setting goals for treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Termination of treatment and closure</p><p/><p>The patient, family, and clinician determine the goals of treatment by discussing which problems in family functioning should be addressed. These problems are identified in the family assessment, which includes use of the General Functioning Scale from the Family Assessment Device (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Family functioning'</a> above)&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F54714\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54714 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The basic principles of treatment are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Including as many family members as possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treating current problems and developing the family's problem-solving skills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active collaboration between the clinician and family</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modeling of open and direct communication by the clinician</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focusing on the family's strengths</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family's responsibility for changing their behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emphasizing behavioral change and concrete tasks that are easily evaluated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emphasizing positive feelings for emotionally-oriented tasks</p><p/><p>Improving the family's problem-solving skills starts by eliciting how the family identifies and resolves problems that occur, the difficulties and dissatisfactions that arise during this process, and what changes the family wants to make so that problems are resolved in a reasonable manner that is satisfactory to all. As an example, the family may need to reduce its expenses because the depressed patient is no longer providing an income. Treatment involves examining how the family identifies, discusses, and negotiates this problem; who decides what expenses will be reduced or how new income will be generated; who is responsible for carrying out the necessary steps; and who is responsible for ensuring the necessary steps have been taken. The family decides which aspects of this process to change in order to better its skills at addressing issues as they arise, and practices its skills with other problems.</p><p>Improvements in family functioning should focus upon specific behaviors that are easily verified. As an example, if the family identifies a dirty kitchen as a problem and decides who is responsible for keeping it clean, the next step is to determine what concrete changes need to be made. Do the dishes need to be washed? How frequently? Does the floor need to be swept or washed? How frequently? Does the trash need to be removed? How frequently?</p><p>Emotionally-oriented tasks may involve changing how family members respond to each others' feelings. As an example, family members may need to consciously work to respond with empathy to the patient's depressed feelings, rather than impatience or frustration.</p><p>Problem Centered Systems Therapy of the Family is a short-term, time-limited treatment. A typical course of treatment is 6 to 12 weekly sessions, each lasting one hour. A practical guide for <span class=\"nowrap\">couples/family</span> therapy for depression is shown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F78200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78200 \">table 2</a>). In addition, a manual is available for problem centered systems therapy, which permits easier learning and consistent application [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychoeducation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychoeducational family therapy focuses upon altering negative attributions about the patient's depression, teaching coping skills, providing support, and teaching the family about the signs and symptoms of depression, available treatments, and course of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Emotion focused therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emotion focused therapy is the integration of a family systems approach, an affective and experiential approach, and attachment theory. It delineates conflicts between partners, identifies negative interactional cycles, accesses unacknowledged feelings, reframes problems in terms of underlying feelings, promotes identification with disowned needs and aspects of self, promotes acceptance by each partner of the other partner's experience, facilitates the expression of needs and wants, and establishes the emergence of new solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive-behavioral marital therapy is a time-limited and structured treatment which emphasizes changes in attitude, behavior, and affect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Treatment initially focuses on outlining problems, modifying negative expectations about individual and relationship change, and changing explanatory style. Treatment emphasizes restoring pleasant interactions and shared activities for the couple, and improving communication and problem-solving skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTINUING CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Through a course of family therapy it is important to continue to monitor the patient's depression and also the possibility of the emergence or presence of mood disorders in other family members.</p><p>There is some controversy about who should provide family interventions and how to integrate family therapy with individual psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for the depressed patient. Many psychiatrists choose to meet with family members solely for gathering historical information, and delegate family interventions to social workers or family therapists.</p><p>Integration of care refers to the coordination of different therapies such as pharmacotherapy and family therapy provided by different clinicians. This is the model that is most frequently used. It has the advantage of being less time-consuming for the clinician and allows for greater specialization of skills. Its disadvantages are that it requires ongoing communication between the different clinicians and requires that they have a synergistic or complementary approach that suits the patient.</p><p>Integrated treatment refers to the provision of the necessary components of treatment, biological, psychological, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> social by one clinician. The benefits include better understanding of the illness and its context, more consistent and better coordinated care, and lower cost. Its shortcomings are the difficulty in acquiring the different skills, it is more time-consuming for the clinician, it has a greater potential for breaching confidentiality, and it is more difficult for the clinician to maintain neutrality. In order for the psychiatrist to deliver integrated treatment, he or she has to be comfortable with multiple roles, accepted by the patient and the family, and able to pay special attention to boundaries and confidentiality.</p><p>There are currently no studies to compare the effectiveness of the integration of care model with the integrated treatment model. Choosing a model is thus based upon the available resources and patient and family preference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE OF EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychotherapy trials, like pharmacotherapy trials, are methodologically variable. Some psychotherapy trials are rigorous and specify a priori hypotheses and analytic tests, use active psychotherapy comparators that control for the nonspecific aspects of psychotherapy, use standardized diagnostic criteria and outcome measures, carefully blind outcome ratings, develop manuals for the psychotherapies that are studied and measure adherence, and stratify patients on predetermined risk variables. Less meticulous studies use open-label designs, less rigorous comparators (eg, treatment as usual or waiting lists), or fail to adequately blind outcome ratings. Although it is commonly believed that blinding of patients in psychotherapy is less successful compared with pharmacotherapy trials, this has never been studied.</p><p>Randomized trials indicate that family therapy and couples therapy are efficacious in treating depression in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. As an example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of eight randomized trials found couples therapy was efficacious for treating middle-aged adults with mild to moderate depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There were a total of 567 couples. Most studies did not permit use of antidepressant medication. Primary findings from the meta-analysis include the following: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Scores on depression rating scales were lower in patients who received couples therapy compared to those who received no treatment (waiting list control), and the clinical effect was large. In addition, patients who received couples therapy were half as likely to meet diagnostic criteria for a depressive syndrome after treatment (relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Couples therapy was equally efficacious with individual psychotherapy (either cognitive-behavioral or interpersonal therapy) in reducing scores on depression rating scales and the proportion of patients meeting diagnostic criteria for a depressive syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Relationship distress was significantly reduced in the couples therapy group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some studies suggest that meta-analyses may overestimate the clinical effect for nearly all types of psychotherapy in treating depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. These inflated clinical effects seem to be the result of publication bias and study quality. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of six randomized trials found generally consistent evidence that family therapy was more efficacious than no treatment (waiting list) for treating depression and for improving family functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review identified 10 randomized trials that evaluated couple (dyadic) and family-oriented interventions in patients with late-life depression (average age 70 years; total n &gt;1800) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The interventions lasted 2 to 12 months, and included psychoeducation, problem solving therapy, and behavioral activation. Family therapy was superior to control conditions (eg, usual care), and for patients with unipolar major depression, the clinical benefit was moderate.</p><p/><p>Other randomized trials, not included in the meta-analysis or systematic reviews, also support using family therapy to treat depression. These trials have found that family therapy provides additional benefits beyond those provided by pharmacotherapy alone and that the benefits of family therapy are comparable to individual therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/43,57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,57-59</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial assigned 121 patients with moderate to severe major depression to pharmacotherapy alone, pharmacotherapy plus family therapy (Problem Centered Systems Therapy of the Family), pharmacotherapy plus individual cognitive therapy, or pharmacotherapy plus family therapy plus individual cognitive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Improvement in depression occurred in significantly more patients who received a family therapy component compared to patients who did not (45 versus 10 percent). In addition, patients treated with family therapy had significantly less suicidal ideation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial assigned 83 depressed patients and their partners to treatment as usual, treatment as usual combined with single family therapy, or treatment as usual combined with multifamily group therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Significantly more patients who received either multifamily group or single family therapy improved compared with patients who received treatment as usual (49 versus 24 versus 9 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial compared family psychoeducation plus treatment as usual with treatment as usual alone in 54 patients partially or fully remitted from a major depressive episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Only family members participated in the four family psychoeducation group sessions, which consisted of didactic lectures and group problem-solving. Relapse during the nine-month follow-up occurred in significantly fewer patients in the psychoeducation group, compared to the control group (8 versus 50 percent). </p><p/><p>The efficacy of family therapy for treatment-resistant depression has not been well studied. One open-label study included family members in a depression management program that taught patients to cope more effectively with their depressive illness in spite of its persistence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The program consisted of nine sessions (five individual and four family), each lasting 50 minutes, conducted over 16 weeks, that focused upon improving quality of life and psychosocial and family functioning, rather than decreasing depressive symptoms. Nineteen patients enrolled in the study. Psychosocial and family functioning improved significantly in the 14 patients who completed the program. Depressive symptoms also improved significantly, although this was not a primary outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Durability of improvements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no long-term studies of family therapy that have evaluated whether treatment gains persist for years. Outcome studies of other psychotherapies suggest that patients who have learned to identify and manage their problems are in a better position to maintain treatment gains and avoid a recurrent depressive episode, or can deal more effectively with a recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/family-and-couples-therapy-for-treating-depressed-adults/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed patients can benefit from a meeting with their clinician and significant others in order to evaluate the patient's social situation, the presence of life changes, nature of the family's relationships, the family's understanding of depression, their awareness of what treatment involves, and the family's expectations of the patient and the clinician. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family therapy is indicated for families who have pronounced difficulty in dealing with depression in their loved one, particularly when <span class=\"nowrap\">marital/family</span> problems predate the onset of the depression.

Common features of these therapies include: changing maladaptive patterns of family interactions, promoting supportive aspects of relationships, rebuilding pleasant interactions, educating families about depression and ways of coping with it, improving communication and problem-solving skills, and reducing blame and criticism within the family. The Problem Centered Systems Therapy of the Family is described in more detail.

Family interventions can create difficulties if the clinician implies that family members caused the patient's depression. Focusing upon emotion laden issues may help some patients, but can also lead to discontinuation of treatment as well as marital separations.
