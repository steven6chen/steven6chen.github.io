Homocystinuria or severe hyperhomocysteinemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe elevations in plasma and urine homocysteine concentrations. Clinical manifestations of homocystinuria include developmental delay, osteoporosis, ocular abnormalities, thromboembolic disease, and severe premature atherosclerosis. Homocystinuria is not discussed further in this topic review.</p><p>Less marked elevations in plasma homocysteine are much more common, occurring in 5 to 7 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Although unassociated with the clinical stigmata of homocystinuria, mounting evidence suggests that moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease and for recurrent venous thromboembolism.</p><p>This topic will review the risks associated with elevated homocysteine levels, screening for hyperhomocysteinemia, and the evidence evaluating the use of vitamin supplements that lower homocysteine levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY OF HYPERHOMOCYSTEINEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Homocysteine is metabolized by one of two divergent pathways: transsulfuration and remethylation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72986\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72986 \">figure 1</a>). The transsulfuration of homocysteine to cysteine is catalyzed by cystathionine-&szlig;-synthase, a process that requires pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) as a cofactor. Remethylation of homocysteine produces methionine. This reaction is catalyzed either by methionine synthase or by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is the precursor of methylcobalamin, which is the cofactor for methionine synthase.</p><p>Elevations in the plasma homocysteine concentration can occur due to genetic defects in the enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism, to nutritional deficiencies in vitamin cofactors, or to other factors including some chronic medical conditions and drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72986\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72986 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>]. Some drugs used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, such as fibrates and nicotinic acid, can raise homocysteine levels by approximately 30 percent; however, the clinical significance of this is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Cigarette smoking also may elevate homocysteine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Chronic kidney failure can increase homocysteine levels due to decreased renal removal and impaired metabolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease (dialysis)&quot;, section on 'Hyperhomocysteinemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Thermolabile variant of MTHFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common form of genetic hyperhomocysteinemia results from production of a thermolabile variant of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with reduced enzymatic activity (T mutation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72986\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72986 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The gene encoding for this variant contains a cytosine to thymine substitution at nucleotide 677 (C677T) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The responsible gene is common, with a population frequency estimated between 5 to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Homozygosity for the thermolabile variant of MTHFR (TT genotype) is a relatively common cause of mildly elevated plasma homocysteine levels in the general population, often occurring in association with low serum folate levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. As an example, one study of 625 men found that 11.5 percent were homozygous for the TT genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, for those in the top 5 and 10 percent of plasma homocysteine concentrations, the frequency rose to 48 and 36 percent, respectively. Homozygotes also had the lowest serum folate concentrations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased blood levels of homocysteine may reflect deficiency of folate, vitamin B6, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vitamin B12&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. Plasma folate and B12 levels, in particular, are strong determinants of the homocysteine concentration. Homocysteine levels are inversely related to folate consumption, reaching a stable baseline level when folate intake exceeds 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;g/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Vitamin B6 is a weaker determinant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The importance of vitamin deficiency in the pathogenesis of hyperhomocysteinemia was evaluated in a cohort of 1041 elderly subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Two-thirds of patients with elevated homocysteine levels had a subnormal plasma concentration of folate, vitamin B12, or pyridoxal-5-phosphate (the coenzyme form of vitamin B6). The prevalence of low plasma B12 levels was higher in this cohort than in the younger participants in a European case-control study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These data suggest that suboptimal B12 intake coupled with poorer absorption might play a greater role in elevating homocysteine and subsequent CHD risk in older adults than in younger patients. In contrast, folate intake low enough to raise plasma homocysteine may be relatively common in the general population, particularly in moderate consumers of alcohol.</p><p>Further evidence of the importance of vitamin deficiency comes from a report that assessed the results of the United States Food and Drug Administration regulation requiring all enriched grain products be fortified with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>. Patients who had blood tested following fortification had significantly higher blood folate concentrations and lower homocysteine concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, the prevalence of a high homocysteine concentration (&gt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span> decreased from 18.7 before fortification to 9.8 percent after fortification.</p><p>Additional support for the role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> and perhaps vitamin B6 in hyperhomocysteinemia comes from a trial that randomly assigned 158 healthy siblings of 167 patients with premature atherothrombotic disease to folic acid (5 mg daily) and vitamin B6 (250 mg daily) or placebo; most of the siblings and all of the patients had postmethionine loading hyperhomocysteinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. After a two-year follow-up, fasting and postmethionine homocysteine levels significantly decreased with vitamin supplementation, from 14.7 to 7.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L</span> and 64.9 to 34.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L</span> respectively, while there were no changes with placebo therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ATHEROTHROMBOTIC PROPERTIES OF HOMOCYSTEINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Homocysteine has primary atherogenic and prothrombotic properties.

Thus, adequate folate status appears to minimize the effect that the MTHFR TT genotype has on risk of cardiovascular disease. Another possible explanation is the difference in vitamin B2 (riboflavin) fortification in North America and Europe. A randomized trial found that vitamin B2 supplementation lowered homocysteine levels in patients with the MTHFR TT genotype but not in those with other genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low levels of vitamin B6 may be independently associated with CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. After adjusting for other risk factors, higher plasma concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate were associated with a lower incidence of CHD; the relative risk for the highest versus lowest quintile was 0.28. This is supported by the data from a multicenter European study that showed that vitamin B6 was directly related to CHD risk independent of homocysteine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Vitamin B6 may be more effective in counteracting the effects of methionine loading (simulating the fed state) on homocysteine levels, while folate may be more important in regulating plasma homocysteine in the fasting state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>].</p><p/><p>Data from studies are somewhat inconsistent, however.

There was also no reduction in recurrent VTE in the 360 patients with baseline homocysteine levels above the 75th percentile (HR 1.14, CI 0.65-1.98), or in the 341 patients with normal homocysteine levels (HR 0.58, CI 0.31-1.07).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A secondary analysis from the HOPE-2 trial, described above (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> above), found no effect of vitamin therapy on rates of VTE (HR 1.01, CI 0.66-1.53) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>]. Vitamin therapy also did not appear to be effective in the 821 patients with a baseline homocysteine in the highest quartile in the study (&gt;13.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L),</span> however, the confidence intervals were wide (HR 1.71, CI 0.48-6.06).</p><p/><p>Based on these data, we suggest not screening for or treating hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with VTE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPLEMENTATION IN THE GENERAL POPULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meta-analysis of randomized trials in patients with known cardiovascular (CV) disease or with at least some risk factors for CV disease has generally shown no overall benefit to supplementation aimed at reducing homocysteine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. </p><p>However, a randomized trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation (0.8 mg daily) in Chinese adults with hypertension found a reduction in the risk of first stroke (2.7 versus 3.4 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.68-0.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. This trial was performed in patients with low folate levels and with very low rates of use of statins and antiplatelet agents, and there was some suggestion that the benefit was primarily in patients with the lowest baseline levels of folate. These results are consistent with an earlier meta-analysis of folic acid supplementation and stroke that found benefits in populations with no or partial fortification of food with folic acid, and that also found greater benefit in trials in patients with low use of statins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-homocysteine/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>].</p><p>Additionally, even for populations with high background folate levels, it is uncertain whether relatively short-term trials of supplements in secondary prevention, which have generally not found benefits in these populations, apply to long-term treatment for primary prevention. However, with several other forms of therapy (eg, statins, hormone replacement), effects in primary prevention appear similar to those first demonstrated in secondary prevention.</p><p>In the absence of more direct evidence, in patients living in areas where there is high dietary consumption of folate, we do not recommend vitamin supplementation for the purpose of lowering homocysteine levels for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, in patients at increased risk of stroke (eg, those with hypertension) living in areas without dietary fortification with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> and who are not being treated with statins, folic acid supplementation appears beneficial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperhomocysteinemia appears to be an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular, peripheral arterial, and coronary heart disease, and for venous thromboembolic disease. However, it does not appear to be as important as other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Role in vascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reasonable interpretation of the results of trials in primary and secondary prevention is that adequate intake of B vitamins, whether in the diet or from supplements, prevents homocysteine-associated vascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not screening for hyperhomocysteinemia, including in patients with otherwise unexplained venous thrombosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

In particular, patients at increased risk of stroke (eg, those with hypertension) who live in areas without dietary fortification and who are not being treated with statins appear to benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation. In patients who require supplementation, we suggest daily B-vitamin intake (whether by diet or supplementation) be adequate to maintain individuals well above deficiency levels of B vitamins (eg, 2 mg vitamin B6; 6 mcg vitamin B12, 400 mcg folic acid) rather than treatment with high doses of B vitamins (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If 0.4 to 1.0 mg daily dose of folic acid does not lower elevated levels of homocysteine, plasma levels of folic acid and B12 concentrations should be measured. If these values are within normal limits, instead of raising the doses of vitamin supplementation, it is suggested to consider the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betaine-anhydrous-not-equivalent-to-betaine-hydrochloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betaine</a> or choline.
