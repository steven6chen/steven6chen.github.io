It has been classified as the single member of the genus <em>Hepevirus</em> in the family <em>Hepeviridae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Three large open reading frames (ORFs) of the positive-sense RNA of HEV have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest ORF consists of 1693 codons; it codes for nonstructural proteins that are responsible for the processing and replication of the virus, including a methyltransferase, an RNA helicase, a cysteine protease, and an RNA polymerase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second ORF is composed of 660 codons and codes for viral capsid structural proteins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third ORF consists of 123 codons; data suggest that it acts as a viroporin, which may facilitate release of infectious virions from infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519981621\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phylogenetic analysis suggests that there are at least five HEV genotypes, but only four are known to be associated with human infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Genotypes 1 and 2 appear to be confined to humans, while genotypes 3 and 4 infect humans and animals (including but not limited to swine, deer, dolphins, cows, nonhuman primates, and bears) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. HEV genotypes differ in their prevalence by geographic region and in their route of transmission (eg, waterborne versus zoonotic) as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1579711135\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes 20 million new infections annually, with more than 3 million cases of acute hepatitis and over 55,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. HEV infection has a global distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/2,14-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14-27</a>].

The highest prevalence is in Asia and Africa where outbreaks of HEV have been related to consumption of contaminated drinking water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/1,31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,31-34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1579711135\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> below.)</p><p>An outbreak of HEV in the Lake Chad region of Africa was reported in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The outbreak was first noted in Niger, where an increase in cases of jaundice was observed among pregnant women in January 2017. As of May 3, 2017, the WHO reported 282 suspected cases, including 27 deaths among pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In July of 2017, the WHO reported an outbreak in nearby Nigeria, where 146 confirmed and suspected cases were reported. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> below.)</p><p>In the United States, the overall seroprevalence of HEV was estimated to be 21 percent between 1988 through 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The prevalence was highest in non-Hispanic whites and those living in the Midwest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metropolitan areas. The risk was also greater in those who had a pet at home or consumed liver or other organ meats more than once per month. High rates of HEV seroprevalence have been seen in those with chronic hepatitis C infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>However, rates of HEV exposure in the United States appear to be declining. As an example, in a study that analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, antibody levels among those aged &ge;6 years were only 6 percent from 2009 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a cross-sectional study of 18,829 blood donations over a six-month period in 2013, two samples had HEV RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Samples were taken from six geographic regions, and both positive samples were from the Midwest, where the overall prevalence appears to be higher. </p><p>In a 2017 surveillance analysis, the European Centre for Disease Prevention reported an increase in the number of confirmed HEV cases in Europe: from 514 cases in 2005 to 5617 cases in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. It is unclear if this represents a true rise in HEV incidence or an increase in detection of cases due to growing awareness and testing for HEV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1579711135\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of hepatitis E virus (HEV) can occur through contaminated food and water, blood transfusions, and through mother-to-child transmission. Although person-to-person transmission is uncommon, patients are infectious during fecal shedding. Specific genotypes differ in their route of transmission. Additional information on the different HEV genotypes is presented above. (See <a href=\"#H519981621\" class=\"local\">'Genotypes'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contaminated</strong> <strong>food</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>water</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Waterborne infection</strong> &ndash; HEV genotype 1 and 2 infections are spread by fecally contaminated water in endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/3,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,42</a>]. Thus, in resource-limited countries where sanitation and water purification services are limited, there is a high rate of lifetime exposure to HEV associated with HEV genotype 1 and 2 (and possibly 4) infection. Acute hepatitis due to waterborne infection may appear as an endemic process with a high cumulative lifetime risk of exposure. This pattern is seen in the Nile River valley and is thought to be associated with contaminated ground water obtained from shallow wells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In other parts of the world (eg, Africa, India, Bangladesh), endemic waterborne disease occurs at a baseline rate, but is punctuated by explosive epidemics of acute HEV-associated hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/36,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,44,45</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Zoonotic transmission</strong> &ndash; HEV genotypes 3 and 4 usually cause infections due to consumption of contaminated food. Most cases are sporadic and unidentified as an acute viral hepatitis, although isolated outbreaks have occurred, including an HEV outbreak associated with consumption of shellfish that affected passengers on a cruise ship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Zoonotic transmission of HEV is also supported by the observation of high anti-HEV seroprevalence among individuals with occupational exposure to animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/15,24,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24,47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Swine are most frequently implicated in transmission, followed by consumption of filter feeder shellfish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>]. However, many animal species (including rodents in some regions), have been identified as part of the viral reservoir of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. HEV transmission has been reported from consumption of undercooked deer meat, wild boar meat, pig liver sausage, and internal organs of animals in Japan, Germany, and France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>]. One study strongly implicated cow milk as a potential source of HEV genotype 4 in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In addition, transmission of HEV to rhesus macaques was reported following administration of both raw and pasteurized milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">There are limited data regarding food preparation to <span class=\"nowrap\">reduce/eliminate</span> HEV transmission. In one study, cooking liver at 191&deg;F for five minutes or boiling liver for five minutes reduced the risk of transmission by inactivating HEV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood transfusion</strong> &ndash; HEV can be transmitted by blood transfusions, particularly in endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>]. In one study that evaluated the prevalence and transmission of HEV in 225,000 blood donations, 79 HEV genotype 3 RNA-positive donations were detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. These donations were used to prepare 129 blood components and 62 were transfused. On follow-up testing of 43 recipients, 18 (42 percent) HEV infections were detected. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perinatal transmission</strong> &ndash; There are limited data regarding vertical transmission of HEV from infected mothers to their infants. Case series suggest that HEV infection can be transmitted from mother to newborn with substantial perinatal morbidity and mortality; however, its contribution to the overall disease burden appears to be small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transmission in breast milk</strong> &ndash; It is unclear if breastfeeding is a potential route of HEV transmission. However, there is sufficient concern to discourage breastfeeding among confirmed HEV-infected mothers until further data are available. In one case report, HEV was isolated in breast milk during the acute phase of HEV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

The vast majority of patients with acute HEV are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The proportion of people who develop clinical features following acute infection varies based upon age and prior HEV exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>In symptomatic patients, jaundice is usually accompanied by malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and hepatomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

As an example, in the United States Acute Liver Failure Study, only 3 of 681 adults demonstrated anti-HEV IgM antibodies, but none were HEV RNA positive, indicating that acute HEV is not a common cause of acute hepatic failure in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-e-virus-infection/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. When it does occur, acute hepatic failure is more likely in those who are pregnant and in those who are malnourished or have preexisting liver disease.

HEV infection has a global distribution, but the prevalence rates are higher in developing countries as compared with developed countries. There are four genotypes that can infect humans. Genotype prevalence varies across geographic regions. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transmission of HEV can occur through contaminated food and water, blood transfusions, and through mother-to-child transmission. Distinct genotypes differ in their route of transmission. HEV genotype 1 and 2 typically cause sporadic hepatitis and outbreaks of HEV in areas such as Asia and Africa, which are related to consumption of contaminated drinking water. By contrast, zoonotic transmission, which occurs from ingestion of undercooked meat or through close contact with animals, usually occurs in Europe, North America, and Far East Asia, and results from genotype 3 and, less frequently, genotype 4. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Virology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1579711135\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical signs and symptoms in patients with typical HEV infection are similar to those seen with other forms of acute viral hepatitis. Jaundice is usually accompanied by malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and hepatomegaly. Other less common features include diarrhea, arthralgia, pruritus, and urticarial rash. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Acute hepatitis E'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients who acquire HEV spontaneously clear the virus, although up to 60 percent of patients may have prolonged cholestasis. Acute hepatic failure is more likely in those who are pregnant and in those who are malnourished or have preexisting liver disease. Chronic HEV has been described almost exclusively in immunocompromised hosts (eg, organ transplantation). (See <a href=\"#H2945482180\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H221415426\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute HEV is typically based upon the detection of IgM antibodies to HEV, but both false positives and negative are common with available assays. Thus, additional serologic testing or HEV RNA testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with suspected chronic HEV infection, detection of HEV RNA in serum is the mainstay of diagnosis. Chronic HEV infection is defined as detection of HEV RNA in serum or stool for longer than six months. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of acute HEV infection is usually supportive, as the disease appears to be mild and self-limited in immunocompetent patients. (See <a href=\"#H1466856868\" class=\"local\">'Acute hepatitis E'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of chronic infection involves a reduction of immunosuppressive therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the use of antiviral therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114389\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114389 \">algorithm 1</a>). We suggest a 12-week course of antiviral therapy for certain nonpregnant patients (eg, for solid organ transplant recipients, if immunosuppressive therapy cannot be reduced, if the patient has persistent HEV RNA despite a reduction in immunosuppressive therapy) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Most experience has been with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> monotherapy. The subsequent approach to treatment depends upon the virologic response. (See <a href=\"#H1464085943\" class=\"local\">'Chronic hepatitis E'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To prevent HEV infection, travelers to endemic areas (ie, Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Central America) should engage in practices that may prevent infection, such as avoiding drinking water of unknown purity, uncooked shellfish, and uncooked fruits or vegetables. A vaccine against HEV has been developed but is not widely available.
