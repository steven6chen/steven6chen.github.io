The minute-to-minute regulation of serum ionized calcium is exclusively regulated through PTH, maintaining the concentration of this cation within a narrow range, through stimulation of renal tubular calcium reabsorption and bone resorption. PTH secretion is, in turn, regulated by serum ionized calcium acting via an exquisitely sensitive calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) on the surface of parathyroid cells. </p><p>Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by abnormal regulation of PTH secretion by calcium, resulting in hypersecretion of PTH relative to the serum calcium concentration. Experimental findings have advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology and causes of primary hyperparathyroidism.

The minute-to-minute regulation of the ionized calcium concentration is achieved through a tightly regulated calcium-parathyroid hormone (PTH) homeostatic system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. PTH is secreted almost instantaneously in response to very small reductions in serum ionized calcium, which are sensed by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). The increase in PTH release raises the serum calcium concentration toward normal via three actions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid hormone secretion and action&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased bone resorption, which occurs within minutes after PTH secretion increases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased intestinal calcium absorption mediated by increased production of calcitriol, the most active form of vitamin D, which occurs days after PTH secretion increases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased urinary calcium excretion due to stimulation of calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule, which occurs within minutes after PTH secretion increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

PTH secretion in this condition is not completely autonomous and can usually be partially inhibited by a further rise in serum calcium. If this did not occur, then patients with this disorder would have higher serum calcium concentrations than are usually found.</p><p>The increase in PTH secretion in primary hyperparathyroidism is, in part, due to an elevation in set-point. The increase in the set-point, ranging between 15 to 30 percent above that of a normal parathyroid gland, is the major determinant of the severity of the hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There is, in addition, a variable change in the slope of the calcium-PTH curve due to relative nonsuppressibility of PTH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The degrees of hypersecretion and nonsuppressibility are a function of tumor mass and range from none in patients with very small adenomas to considerable in patients with large ones. Both a functional change at the cellular level (a reduced number of calcium receptors on the parathyroid cell) and increased numbers of cells probably contribute to these changes in PTH secretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">The calcium-sensing receptor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The receptor responsible for calcium sensing by the parathyroid gland has been cloned; it is a seven transmembrane-domain, guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. While germline inactivating mutations in this gene are commonly present in patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), they do not appear to occur as acquired somatic mutations in sporadic parathyroid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. There may be a small subset of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and hypercalciuria, responsive to parathyroid surgery, which is due to inactivating germline mutation on the <em>CASR</em>, thus expanding the phenotypic spectrum associated with <em>CASR</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There may be an association between the SRQ haplotype of the <em>CASR</em> in patients with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Although there seem to be no somatic mutations of the gene, expression of the calcium-sensing protein is reduced in parathyroid adenomas and also in uremic hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD)&quot;</a>). In both instances, the reduction in expression of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) on the surface of parathyroid cells may contribute to the increase in PTH secretion. However, PTH secretion from large adenomas may be more related to the increased cell mass since in one series, for example, there was little correlation between serum calcium concentrations and receptor expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

These mutations render the receptor (expressed in the parathyroid glands, kidneys, and other tissues) relatively insensitive to calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], causing a rightward shift in the calcium-PTH curve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. It is important to distinguish this familial calcium-sensing disorder from typical primary hyperparathyroidism because parathyroid surgery is usually of no benefit in the former.

However, the most common clinical presentation of primary hyperparathyroidism now is asymptomatic hypercalcemia detected by routine biochemical screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62696\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62696 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The routine measurement of serum calcium with the widespread use of multichannel biochemical screening initially led to a marked rise in the incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. In the local population served by the Mayo Clinic, as an example, the annual incidence rose from 16 per 100,000 person-years before 1974 (prescreening) to a peak of 112 per 100,000 person-years several years later and then declined with elimination of calcium from the automated chemistry panel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There was a second peak in the incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism between 1998 and 2007 (86 per 100,000 person-years), attributed to the rise in bone density measurements and screening for osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the United States, the estimated incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism between 1998 and 2010 was approximately 50 per 100,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Primary hyperparathyroidism can occur at any age, but the great majority of cases occur in patients over the age of 50 to 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Women are affected twice as often as men, probably because the increase in bone resorption that follows menopause unmasks parathyroid gland hyperactivity. In one study, the incidence of hyperparathyroidism was highest among blacks, followed by whites, Asians, Hispanics, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cause for primary hyperparathyroidism, such as irradiation or the rare genetic abnormalities in the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, can be identified in only a small number of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of irradiation to the head and neck, on average 20 to 40 years before the development of hyperparathyroidism, can be obtained in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. As an example, in a cohort of cleanup workers who worked at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986, primary hyperparathyroidism subsequently developed in 15 of 61 workers (odds ratio compared with prevalence in nonexposed population 63.4, 95% CI 35.7-112.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The mean whole body radiation exposure ranged from 0.3 to 8.7 Gy.</p><p>Hyperparathyroidism has also been reported in patients receiving radiation for benign conditions. The usual radiation dose given for benign conditions several decades ago was low; the mean dose in one study was 0.58 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Nevertheless, in this study of 2555 patients followed for up to 50 years, even doses as low as 0.5 Gy before age 16 years were associated with a small risk of primary hyperparathyroidism. The excess relative risk (RR) is dose dependent, being approximately 5 to 10 at 1.0 Gy, whether the radiation came from external X-radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] or from an atomic bomb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, the probability of primary hyperparathyroidism at this degree of exposure is still quite low, being less than 1 percent at 35 years and approaching 5 percent after 50 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>One study compared the clinical presentation and course of hyperparathyroidism in exposed (49 patients) and nonexposed (389 patients) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There were no clinically important differences with respect to presentation, pathology, or recurrences during six years of follow-up. However, the exposed patients had more concurrent thyroid tumors, which can make management more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In one prospective cohort study, which followed over 58,000 female nurses for 22 years, primary hyperparathyroidism was diagnosed in 277 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The risk of developing primary hyperparathyroidism was inversely related to calcium intake (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.86 for women in the group with the highest compared with lowest calcium intake). The decreased risk was significant after adjusting for age, vitamin D intake, body mass index (BMI), and race. Median total calcium intake (diet plus supplement) in the lowest to highest quintiles ranged from 522 to 1794 mg daily.
