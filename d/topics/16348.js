Because most are discovered incidentally in an appendectomy specimen done for other reasons, a decision must be made whether or not to return the patient to the operating room for a right colectomy. Unlike simple appendectomy, colectomy removes the draining lymph nodes of the appendix and any residual disease that might remain at the base of the appendix or in the mesoappendix.</p><p>Because of the association of tumor size with prognosis, a right hemicolectomy has been traditionally recommended for tumors greater than 2 cm or those with mesoappendiceal invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-treatment-and-posttreatment-surveillance-of-nonmetastatic-well-differentiated-gastrointestinal-tract-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. On the other hand, whether or not a colectomy should be performed in some patients with smaller tumors is unclear; there is limited evidence on which to base clear indications for hemicolectomy. Some clinicians pursue completion right colectomy for tumors &lt;2 cm only if there is evidence of mesoappendiceal invasion or positive or unclear margins, while others disagree and consider that appendectomy alone is adequate for tumors &lt;2 cm, even with mesoappendiceal invasion. There is general agreement that tumors less than 1 cm can usually be treated by simple appendectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-treatment-and-posttreatment-surveillance-of-nonmetastatic-well-differentiated-gastrointestinal-tract-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>These issues are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

According to one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-treatment-and-posttreatment-surveillance-of-nonmetastatic-well-differentiated-gastrointestinal-tract-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], metastases were found in 2 percent of patients with tumors &lt;1 cm, 10 to 15 percent in patients with tumors measuring 1.0 to 1.9 cm, and 60 to 80 percent in tumors measuring &gt;2 cm. Another report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-treatment-and-posttreatment-surveillance-of-nonmetastatic-well-differentiated-gastrointestinal-tract-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] indicated that in tumors &lt;2 cm, the rate of metastasis was 2 percent of patients if the tumor was confined to the submucosa, but as high as 48 percent if the tumor invaded the muscularis propria. More recent reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-treatment-and-posttreatment-surveillance-of-nonmetastatic-well-differentiated-gastrointestinal-tract-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] have identified additional prognostic factors, including mitotic index and lymphovascular invasion (LVI), which could portend a poorer prognosis even among patients with relatively small (&lt;2 cm) and superficial tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-treatment-and-posttreatment-surveillance-of-nonmetastatic-well-differentiated-gastrointestinal-tract-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Treatment options for localized rectal NETs include conventional endoscopic resection (standard polypectomy or endoscopic mucosal resection [EMR]), advanced endoscopic resection (endoscopic submucosal dissection, transanal endoscopic microsurgery [TEM], cap-assisted EMR), transanal surgical resection, or radical resection (low anterior resection [LAR], abdominoperineal resection [APR]).

A key principle underlying selection of appropriate therapy for advanced disease is the indolent nature of most well-differentiated NETs and their prolonged natural history. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a localized NET, we recommend resection, the extent of which depends upon the site of origin and the size of the primary tumor (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Resection of the primary tumor may be advised even in patients with known distant metastases in order to reduce the potential for bowel obstruction or bleeding, or to palliate abdominal pain related to the primary tumor. This is a controversial area, and decision making must be individualized.

A right hemicolectomy has been traditionally recommended for tumors &gt;2 cm. It is unclear whether other potential risk factors, such as mesoappendiceal invasion, should lead to recommendation for right hemicolectomy in patients with a tumor size of 1 to 2 cm. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Appendix'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with small bowel NETs should undergo resection of the involved segment and small bowel mesentery.

Pancreaticoduodenectomy has been advocated for resectable cases regardless of size. However, these recommendations are based on very small case series, and treatment decisions need to be individualized. (See <a href=\"#H5647503\" class=\"local\">'Ampulla of Vater'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectal NETs that are smaller than 1 cm and confined to the mucosa or submucosa (T1) can be treated by local endoscopic excision. The management of tumors between 1 and 2 cm that are confined to the mucosa or submucosa is controversial, and treatment must be individualized based upon size and the presence of risk factors such as lymphovascular invasion and mitotic rate (or Ki-67 index). Tumors larger than 2 cm and those that invade into or beyond the muscularis propria or have regional lymph node metastases are treated by low anterior resection (LAR) or abdominoperineal resection (APR). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Rectum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with nonmetastatic colonic NETs should be managed with formal partial colectomy and regional lymphadenectomy.

Antrectomy is a reasonable option for type 1 gastric NETs if there are numerous progressive tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>More aggressive surgical therapy is rarely needed for type 1 gastric NETs unless there is extensive tumor involvement of the gastric wall (which increases the risk for a coexisting adenocarcinoma), tumor size &gt;2 cm, or emergent bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14320532\"><span class=\"h2\">Posttreatment followup</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the long natural history and the propensity for small bowel NETs to metastasize, we recommend surveillance with triple-phase computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis roughly every six months for the first year after surgery, then roughly annually for approximately 10 years. A similar surveillance strategy can be pursued for rectal, gastric, and appendiceal NETs &gt;2 cm, although more frequent surveillance should be considered for more aggressive tumors, such as grade 2 gastric or rectal NETs. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posttreatment surveillance generally is not recommended for appendiceal tumors &lt;2 cm and rectal tumors &lt;1 cm in size.
