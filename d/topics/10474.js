The clinical features most suggestive of idiopathic PD rather than an atypical or secondary parkinsonian syndrome include asymmetric or unilateral onset, the presence of resting tremor, and a clear-cut response to treatment with L-dopa.</p><p>In addition to these typical motor features, patients with PD may experience nonmotor symptoms related to the disease itself or to the medications used to treat it. These symptoms include psychosis, hallucinations, daytime sleepiness, depression, fatigue, autonomic dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and dementia.</p><p>Management of these nonmotor symptoms will be reviewed here. Dementia in PD and the clinical features of nonmotor symptoms in PD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Nonmotor symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Other aspects of PD are reviewed elsewhere.

Hallucinations are the most common manifestation, and they affect up to 40 percent of patients with PD, particularly those at an advanced stage of illness. Psychosis may be triggered by infection, delirium, dementia, or medications. The adverse effects of antiparkinson medications, the dopamine agonists in particular, are probably the most important cause of psychosis in patients with PD. Underlying dementia predisposes to hallucinations and delusions, and psychosis is a risk factor for nursing home placement and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Psychosis and hallucinations'</a>.)</p><p>Management of psychosis in patients with PD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F110759\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110759 \">algorithm 1</a>) involves identifying and treating the underlying causes and contributory factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], including general measures that are similar to the treatment of delirium (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a>). Psychosis can be triggered by systemic conditions such as symptomatic or occult infection (eg, pneumonia or urinary tract infection), so this possibility should be investigated and treated if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Psychoactive medications, including sedatives, anxiolytics, and antidepressants, are potential culprits and should be reduced or stopped if possible.</p><p>Stopping all potentially offending antiparkinsonian drugs is usually not an option, although dose reduction can frequently be accomplished with amelioration of hallucinations and little loss of drug-related benefit. Antiparkinsonian drugs may be reduced or stopped in reverse order of their potency and effectiveness if hallucinations are causing disability. The suggested sequence begins with anticholinergic drugs, followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a>, monoamine oxidase type B (MAO B) inhibitors, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors, and dopamine agonists. Levodopa, usually combined with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a>) should be the last of a drug combination to be reduced, since it is the most effective antiparkinson agent and least likely to cause psychosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Levodopa'</a>). However, if given in unusually high doses, it too might need to be reduced. </p><p>For patients with troublesome hallucinations or delusions despite antiparkinson medication adjustments, options include treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimavanserin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimavanserin</a>. The atypical neuroleptics clozapine and quetiapine may be helpful starting with low doses and incrementing slowly according to clinical response (eg, clozapine 12.5 to 50 mg at night or quetiapine 12.5 to 100 mg at night) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>]. Since quetiapine is easier to use than clozapine (no monitoring required) and is often effective, it should be the treatment of first choice.</p><p>Although several open-label studies have shown that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> is effective for treatment of psychosis in patients with PD, and two single-blind randomized trials comparing quetiapine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> showed they were equally effective, only one of five small randomized controlled trials found benefit for quetiapine compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Despite the inconsistent study data, the practical value of quetiapine in clinical practice is well established, and it is by far the most widely used antipsychotic for dopaminergic-induced psychosis.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clozapine</a> is underutilized because of the burdensome requirement of hematologic monitoring, but it is probably the most effective of the atypical neuroleptics in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Clozapine can cause granulocytopenia in 1 to 2 percent of patients, and weekly to biweekly blood counts are required by law in order for patients to use it. The risk of clozapine-induced leukopenia or agranulocytosis decreases exponentially over time, and the likelihood of developing fatal granulocytopenia beyond six months of clozapine treatment is almost nil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clozapine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> do not appear to worsen parkinsonism. By contrast, parkinsonism may be exacerbated by other atypical neuroleptics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, and by typical neuroleptics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>.</p><p>The antipsychotic agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimavanserin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimavanserin</a>, a selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist, was effective for reducing PD-related psychosis in a six-week randomized placebo-controlled trial of 199 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Treatment was well tolerated and was not associated with worsening of motor symptoms or other adverse effects. Based upon the results of this trial, the US Food and Drug Administration approved pimavanserin in 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This drug is likely to be used widely, given its novel mechanisms of action and the limitations posed by other antipsychotics. However, its long-term safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>All antipsychotic drugs appear to be associated with a small increased risk of mortality when used to treat behavioral disorders in older adult patients with dementia. In addition, retrospective data suggest that antipsychotic use is associated with an increased risk of mortality in adults with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, this risk must be balanced with the high morbidity and mortality of untreated psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The issue of mortality risk with antipsychotic medications is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects#H272233794\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Side effect management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the data are inconsistent, a potential benefit of cholinesterase inhibitors for improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with PD dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies has been suggested by some studies. However, these drugs do not appear to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms to a clinically significant extent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia#H1560970366\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&quot;, section on 'Antidementia drugs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEMENTIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While PD can coexist with other common causes of dementia, such as Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia, dementia is increasingly recognized as a common feature of PD itself. Dementia associated with PD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DAYTIME SLEEPINESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep disorders including insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) with sleep attacks, restless legs syndrome, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) affect between 55 and 80 percent of patients with PD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Sleep disorders'</a>.)</p><p>Management of EDS involves efforts to improve nocturnal sleep hygiene and to treat causes of poor nocturnal sleep, such as nocturia and pain. Pharmacologic treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>, or judicious use of coffee during the day may offer some benefit.</p><p>However, data regarding the effectiveness of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> are sparse and conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. In the largest of these small trials, 40 subjects with PD and EDS were randomly assigned to treatment with modafinil (200 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There was no benefit for modafinil treatment in the primary outcome measure, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F77101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77101 \">table 1</a>), or any of the secondary outcome measures. Modafinil is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of sleepiness in PD. In the author's clinical experience, modafinil has <strong>not</strong> been effective for treating drowsiness in patients with PD.</p><p>Other therapies are being studied. In a randomized trial of 31 patients with PD and EDS, bright light administered twice daily in one-hour intervals for 14 days improved ESS scores, multiple self-reported sleep quality measures, and physical activity levels compared with a dim red light control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In another small trial, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium oxybate</a>, a controlled substance used to treat cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy, improved ESS scores and sleep quality in 12 patients with PD compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, obstructive sleep apnea or parasomnias developed in three patients, indicating the need for further study with close monitoring and longer-term follow-up. Until more information concerning efficacy and safety is available, sodium oxybate is not recommended for use in patients with PD and carries risk of significant adverse neuropsychiatric side effects such as depression, hallucinations, and rare thoughts of suicide.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">FATIGUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue is a common problem in patients with PD, and it appears to be an independent symptom of PD that overlaps with, but is not causally related to, depression and daytime sleepiness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Fatigue'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of fatigue in PD begins with an attempt to identify the cause. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and depression are both the most common and the most treatable identifiable causes (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Daytime sleepiness'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Depression'</a> below). Potentially reversible causes, such as hypothyroidism and medication side effects, should be investigated as well.</p><p>Differentiating between sleepiness and fatigue is also important. True fatigue unassociated with sleepiness or depression is more difficult to treat. Suboptimally treated bradykinesia sometimes presents as subjective fatigue and should be identified and treated by readjusting antiparkinson medications. However, in some cases fatigue appears in patients with mild bradykinesia and is poorly understood.</p><p>Medications used for empiric treatment of fatigue, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a> and stimulants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> and pemoline, are options. However, the response to these is often disappointing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In one trial, 36 patients with PD were randomly assigned to treatment with either methylphenidate (10 mg three times daily) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At six weeks, there was a significant reduction in two measures of self-reported fatigue for patients assigned to methylphenidate. Based upon the results of this trial, a practice parameter from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) concluded that methylphenidate is &quot;possibly useful&quot; for treating fatigue in patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, it is unclear whether the benefit of methylphenidate for fatigue in this setting is clinically meaningful.</p><p>Of note, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> was not effective for improving either EDS (the primary outcome measure) or fatigue (a secondary outcome measure) in the randomized controlled trial cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Daytime sleepiness'</a> above.)</p><p>In the author's clinical experience, <strong>no</strong> medications have been effective for fatigue in patients with PD, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DEPRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disturbances seen in PD. Depressive symptoms in PD are associated with a negative impact on motor disability and decreased quality of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Mood disorders'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no clear consensus regarding the use of antidepressants in patients with PD. A 2006 practice parameter from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) reviewed six small, randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic treatment for depression in patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In one of these trials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> but not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> treatment was associated with significant improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The AAN found insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of other antidepressant medications in this setting.</p><p>Since the 2006 AAN report, a number of small, randomized placebo-controlled trials have reported the following observations regarding the treatment of depression in patients with PD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Desipramine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a> were equally effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nortriptyline</a> was efficacious while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> controlled release was not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atomoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atomoxetine</a> was not beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Paroxetine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> improved depression and did not worsen motor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]</p><p/><p>Evidence from other randomized controlled trials suggested that the dopaminergic agonists <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropinirole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropinirole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramipexole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramipexole</a> may improve depressive symptoms in patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/11,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,31,32</a>].</p><p>In the absence of a clear first choice for treating depression associated with PD, drug selection should be based on potential advantages versus potential side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It is reasonable to start with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in most patients, as the likelihood of adverse events is lower with SSRIs than with tricyclics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> (and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, to a lesser extent). The anticholinergic side effects of tricyclic medications, which can include cognitive impairment and orthostatic hypotension with an increased risk of falls, may be particularly troublesome in the setting of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, for patients who do not improve with SSRI treatment, a tricyclic antidepressant is a reasonable option when tremor is a dominant symptom and the potential benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of anticholinergic side effects.</p><p>Patients with PD who have apathy as a feature of depression can be treated with antidepressant medications, as there is no specific treatment for apathy or abulia in the absence of depression.

The management of psychosis involves identifying and treating the underlying causes and contributory factors, which may include infection, delirium, dementia, and adverse effects of drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F110759\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110759 \">algorithm 1</a>). Psychoactive medications (eg, sedatives, anxiolytics, and antidepressants) are potential culprits and should be reduced or stopped if possible. Stopping all potentially offending antiparkinsonian drugs is usually not an option for most patients, although dose reduction can frequently be accomplished with amelioration of hallucinations and little loss of drug-related benefit. Antiparkinsonian drugs may be reduced or stopped in reverse order of their potency and effectiveness if hallucinations are causing disability, beginning with anticholinergic drugs, followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a>, then catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors, and dopamine agonists. Levodopa should be the last of a drug combination to be reduced, since it is essential in almost all patients with PD in which it is being used. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimavanserin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimavanserin</a> is an option if all other measures fail. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Psychosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dementia is a common feature of PD. Dementia associated with PD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in PD involves efforts to improve nocturnal sleep hygiene and to treat causes of poor nocturnal sleep. Pharmacologic treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>, or judicious use of coffee during the day may offer some benefit. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Daytime sleepiness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of fatigue in PD begins with an attempt to identify the cause. EDS and depression are the most common and the most treatable causes. Medications used for empiric treatment of fatigue, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a> and stimulants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> and pemoline, are options. However, the response to these is often disappointing. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Fatigue'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no clear consensus regarding the use of antidepressants for the treatment of depression in patients with PD. In the absence of a clear first choice, drug selection should be based on potential advantages versus potential side effects. It seems reasonable to start with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in most patients, as the likelihood of adverse events is lower with SSRIs than with tricyclics antidepressants. Patients with PD who have apathy as a feature of depression can be treated with antidepressant medications, as there is no specific treatment for apathy or abulia in the absence of depression. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Depression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two potential concerns regarding the use of SSRIs for treatment of depression in patients with PD. These are the possibility of aggravating motor symptoms and the possibility of an adverse interaction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a>, a monoamine oxidase type B (MAO B) inhibitor sometimes used to treat PD.
