Babies with colic usually cry more than 3 hours a day, on more than 3 days a week. Bouts of colic usually start suddenly and happen in the evening.</p><p>Colic usually goes away on its own when a baby is 3 or 4 months old. But sometimes it lasts a few months longer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32077978\"><span class=\"h1\">What else besides colic can make a baby cry more than usual?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Babies can cry more than usual when they are hurt, sick, hungry, too hot or cold, or too tired. Babies can also cry more than usual if they are allergic to their formula or to foods in their mother's breast milk. (The food that a woman eats is passed to her baby through her breast milk.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32077985\"><span class=\"h1\">How is colic different from normal crying?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colic is different because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The crying in colic is louder and more high-pitched &ndash; Babies often sound as if they are screaming or in pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents are often not able to comfort or soothe their baby during a bout of colic.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A baby can have a hard belly, stiff arms, or arched back during a bout of colic.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32077992\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for colic?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if your baby has it by talking with you and doing an exam on your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32077999\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to stop my baby's crying?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors and nurses recommend trying different things to help stop your baby's crying (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69458\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69458 \">table 1</a>). For example, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a bottle that keeps your baby from swallowing too much air</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your baby sit up during feedings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carry your baby more in your arms, a sling, or a front carrier</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take your baby for a ride in the car</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give your baby a warm bath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put your baby in a baby swing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swaddle your baby (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57880\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57880 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put your baby near a clothes dryer or other source of background noise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massage your baby's belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change your baby's formula or avoid eating certain foods if you breastfeed &ndash; Before trying these, be sure to talk with your doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32078006\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse as soon as possible during the day or night if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby is younger than 3 months old and has a fever &ndash; To see if your baby has a fever, take his or her temperature. The most accurate way to take a baby's temperature is to take a rectal temperature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74460\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74460 \">figure 2</a>). If your baby's rectal temperature is 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher, then he or she has a fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby cries for longer than 2 hours without stopping</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby refuses to eat or drink, is vomiting, or has bloody bowel movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby is not responding to you or acting normally</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are afraid that you might have hurt your baby &ndash; Shaking, hitting, or hurting a baby can cause serious damage. If you think you might have hurt your baby, even without meaning to, call for help. </p><p/><p>Call your doctor or nurse during regular office hours if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are worried about your baby's crying or don't know how to handle it</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby spits up a lot after feedings, has diarrhea, or has trouble having bowel movements &ndash; These symptoms could mean that your baby is allergic to the formula or to certain foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby is older than 4 months and still having colic</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby is not gaining weight normally</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32078013\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am overwhelmed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having a baby with colic can be exhausting, stressful, and frustrating. Try to remember that your baby's colic is not your fault, and that colic almost always goes away within a few months.</p><p>If possible, take turns with your partner so you both get breaks from your baby's crying. It's also OK to put your baby in a crib, bassinet, or other safe place for a few minutes while you take a break. Try to call a friend or relative if you need help. In the United States, there is also a parent help line (1-800-422-4453) that you can call any time.</p><p>If you need a break, be sure to take one so that you don't hurt your baby. Shaking, hitting, or hurting a baby can cause serious brain problems, or even death.</p><p>Talk to your doctor or nurse if you are having a very hard time or need more support. In some cases, it can help to talk with a counselor who is trained on ways to handle colic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32078020\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-babies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux) in babies (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food allergy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=poor-weight-gain-in-babies-and-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Poor weight gain in babies and children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colic-excessive-crying-in-infants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colic (excessive crying) in infants (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fever in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux) in infants (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
