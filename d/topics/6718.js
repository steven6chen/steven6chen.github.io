Despite advances in induction immunosuppression and use of aggressive maintenance immunosuppression, more than a third of lung transplant recipients are treated for acute rejection in the first year after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

These antibodies may have been present in the recipient at a low level prior to transplant or may develop afterwards. Generally, if HLA antibodies are identified in the potential recipient, the corresponding HLA antigens are avoided in a donor (so-called virtual cross-match).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperacute rejection is a form of humoral rejection that occurs in the first 24 hours following lung transplantation in recipients who have pre-formed anti-HLA antibodies.

Clinically, chronic lung transplant rejection is known as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), which manifests as progressive airway obstruction that is defined as a progressive decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>). In addition, a form of restrictive Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (rCLAD) has been described and appears to have significant prognostic implications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The histopathologic manifestation of acute cellular rejection is a lymphocyte-predominant inflammatory response centered on blood vessels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> airways, the mechanism of which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has developed a &quot;Working Formulation of the Standardization of the Nomenclature in the Diagnosis of Lung Rejection,&quot; which was revised in 2007 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61800\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61800 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. This schema classifies rejection according to the anatomic structures involved and the severity of the abnormality. The key histopathologic features of acute cellular rejection are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A vascular component consisting of perivascular mononuclear infiltrates that may extend to the subendothelium; this lymphocyte infiltration can spread to involve the alveolar walls in higher grades of rejection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63730%7EPULM%2F75560\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63730 graphicRef75560 \">picture 1A-B</a>). The specific alloantigens responsible for this vasocentric inflammatory response remain undefined. The grades range from A0 (no rejection) to A4 (severe).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An airway component with a lymphocytic response initially in the submucosa of bronchioles and with increasing severity extending through the basement membrane. Bronchiolar inflammation may occur either in isolation or simultaneously with vascular inflammation. Ulceration of the airway epithelium may occur in more advanced cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77118%7EPULM%2F52040\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77118 graphicRef52040 \">picture 2A-B</a>). The grades range from B0 (no rejection) to B2R (high grade, revised 2007 system) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Occasional eosinophils may be present in the vascular and bronchiolar components of acute cellular rejection. The presence of hyaline fibrosis in airways and vessels remains the key histologic discriminator between acute and chronic rejection of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5079680\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR ACUTE REJECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of acute lung transplant rejection is greatest in the first few months after transplant and decreases with time. Several factors have been implicated as contributing to the development of acute cellular rejection. The potential factors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) mismatching &ndash; An increasing degree of HLA mismatch between the donor and recipient increases the risk of acute cellular rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, mismatch at certain HLA loci may be more important than at others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic factors &ndash; Genetic variants in interleukin (IL)-10, multidrug resistance genotype, CCL4L chemokine, and toll-like receptor 4(TLR4) may influence the risk of acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppression regimen &ndash; In the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) registry, the rate of acute rejection in the first year was highest among recipients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> based regimens and lowest among those on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> based regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, induction therapy with an interleukin-2R antagonist was associated with a lower rate of acute rejection than other induction regimens.

Often, patients are asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is made from surveillance transbronchial biopsies. When present, symptoms are nonspecific and are shared by other common complications that occur during this period. They include low-grade fever, shortness of breath, and cough with or without sputum production (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54968\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54968 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>]. </p><p>During long-term follow-up of 120 lung transplant recipients, shortness of breath and cough were more common in those with clinically significant acute rejection (grade &ge;A2) than those without (grade A0 or A1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61800\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61800 \">table 1</a>), but comparable in frequency to those with pulmonary infection. For predicting grade &gt;A2 rejection, the sensitivity and specificity were 68 and 50 percent for cough and 63 and 68 percent for shortness of breath, respectively. &#160; </p><p>Lung examination may reveal clear lung fields, crackles, or decreased breath sounds when a pleural effusion is present as part of the acute rejection. High grade rejection may be associated with respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472881\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When lung transplant recipients present with nonspecific respiratory symptoms, the differentiation between acute allograft rejection, airway stenosis, and infection requires a combination of pulmonary function testing, imaging, and bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As acute rejection requires intensification of immunosuppression, which could be deleterious in the presence of opportunistic infection, a definitive diagnosis is highly desirable. In most circumstances this can be achieved by a transbronchial biopsy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435910\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory testing in patients with suspected acute lung transplant rejection is generally nonspecific. Peripheral eosinophilia may be present; however, specific blood markers for rejection are not available. As infection is in the differential diagnosis, microbiologic stains and cultures are obtained from sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial washing samples. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral load testing is performed on peripheral blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients#H695016\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in lung transplant recipients&quot;, section on 'CMV DNA and antigen assays'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2367932906\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spirometry is typically obtained at routine follow-up visits following lung transplantation and if dyspnea develops or worsens. The typical pulmonary function test abnormalities in acute cellular lung transplant rejection are airflow obstruction manifest by a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], or restriction manifest by a reduction in both forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV<sub>1</sub>. The sensitivity of a decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> for detecting acute rejection is approximately 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/2,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25,26</a>]. Thus, stable pulmonary function as determined by spirometry does not exclude acute lung transplant rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Among lung transplant recipients, respiratory infection is associated with a similar decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub>, so spirometry does not differentiate between these entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Bronchial stenosis is in the differential diagnosis of airflow limitation following lung transplantation and provides additional rationale for bronchoscopy to evaluate new respiratory symptoms or a decline in lung function.</p><p>Limited data are available on changes in total lung capacity (TLC) and diffusing capacity (DLCO) in association with acute lung transplant rejection. Among heart-lung transplant recipients, acute rejection is associated with decreases in TLC and DLCO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chest radiograph is typically obtained as part of routine assessment and to assess the cause of new onset of dyspnea or cough in lung transplant recipients. Its main role in this setting is to identify diseases other than acute rejection. In early episodes of rejection (within the first three months), the chest radiograph may demonstrate perihilar opacities and interstitial edema with or without a pleural effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the chest radiograph are low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The chest film is unchanged in approximately 80 percent of later episodes of rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is often obtained to assess the severity and distribution of the disease process or to guide the bronchoscopist in choosing sites for bronchoalveolar lavage or transbronchial biopsy. HRCT findings of acute lung transplant rejection include ground glass opacities, septal thickening, volume loss, and pleural effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, HRCT findings are neither sensitive nor specific and do not differentiate between infection and rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/1,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348992\"><span class=\"h2\">Pleural fluid analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pleural effusions are common in the first two weeks following lung transplantation and do not require fluid analysis unless the effusion is large or the patient has signs of infection. When a new onset pleural effusion is identified after the first couple of weeks, ultrasound guided thoracentesis is usually performed to obtain fluid for analysis and culture. Among patients with a pleural effusion associated with acute cellular lung transplant rejection, the pleural fluid is typically lymphocytic, although this finding is not specific. Chylothorax, another cause of lymphocytic effusions following lung transplantation, can develop due to disruption of the thoracic duct or as a complication of lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

In patients with focal radiographic abnormalities, BAL and biopsies are concentrated in the area of the radiologic abnormality. Samples are sent for cell count and differential, microbiologic stains and cultures, cytology, and histopathology.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bronchoalveolar lavage</strong> &#9472; During the first three months following lung transplantation, total BAL cell counts are elevated, and a neutrophilic alveolitis (eg, 25 to 50 percent neutrophils) is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In contrast, acute cellular rejection is associated with a lymphocytic alveolitis (eg, 10 to 60 percent lymphocytes) with a decreased <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4/CD8</span> ratio. However, these findings are nonspecific and lymphocytic alveolitis is also seen in viral pneumonias and obliterative bronchiolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Data is conflicting, but the degree of BAL lymphocytosis does not correlate well with the histologic grade of rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transbronchial biopsy</strong> &#9472; When imaging studies suggest diffuse disease or are normal, transbronchial biopsies are typically obtained from the lower lobes; when disease is radiographically patchy, biopsies are obtained from diseased areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Practices vary concerning the number of transbronchial biopsies obtained for adequate sampling. Animal studies suggest that three good transbronchial biopsies have a sensitivity of 92 percent in identifying moderate to severe rejection and five biopsies have a similar sensitivity in identifying mild rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/15,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,33</a>]. Most centers try to obtain 6 to 10 biopsies in order to achieve 5 &quot;adequate&quot; or &quot;good&quot; specimens, defined as samples with at least five alveoli. The sensitivity of transbronchial biopsy for diagnosing acute rejection is 61 to 94 percent and the specificity greater than 90 percent with an experienced pulmonary pathologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

The major exception to this practice is in patients who have received bilateral living-donor lobar transplants. In these patients, the lower lobes come from two different donors, and rejection is typically limited to one of the donor lobes and is rarely bilateral. As a result, living-donor recipients with no localizing signs or radiographic abnormalities may need to have both lower lobes biopsied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

In the presence of active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, a common approach is to treat the infection and then repeat the biopsies to assess any contribution of rejection to the patient's clinical syndrome. The alternative of empirically treating possible acute cellular rejection by intensifying immunosuppression is avoided due to concern that it would impair clearance of the CMV infection.

A pilot study of aerosolized cyclosporine suggested a survival benefit but did not demonstrate a reduction in acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]; moreover, in preliminary results, a multi-center trial failed to demonstrate efficacy for aerosolized cyclosporine (CYCLIST trial) in prevention of acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Aerosolized cyclosporine is not commercially available.

(See <a href=\"#H5081209\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of acute cellular rejection is greatest in the first few months after lung transplant and decreases with time.

The grading of acute cellular rejection is described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61800\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61800 \">table 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of patients with suspected acute rejection typically includes laboratory testing for evidence of infection, chest imaging, spirometry, and flexible bronchoscopy. During bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsies (usually 6 to 10 biopsies to achieve at least 5 adequate samples) are obtained from areas of focal radiographic abnormality or from lower lobe subsegments. (See <a href=\"#H472881\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of symptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring of asymptomatic patients usually includes spirometry and surveillance bronchoscopy to enable early diagnosis and treatment of acute rejection, and thus hopefully reduce the risk of chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">rejection/bronchiolitis</span> obliterans syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H58704371\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring asymptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute lung transplant rejection is based on the presence of characteristic histopathologic changes on transbronchial lung biopsy specimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61800\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61800 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of poor allograft function occurring in the first 24 hours following lung transplantation includes primary lung graft dysfunction, anastomotic dehiscence, and fluid overload. In the weeks to months after transplant, the differential includes infection, airway complications (eg, airway stenosis, malacia, or granulation tissue), chronic rejection (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome), thromboembolism, and recurrent primary disease.

(See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'High-dose glucocorticoids'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with persistent acute rejection, we suggest a second course of intravenous glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, 0.5 to 1 gram IV daily for three days) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An alternative or adjunctive therapy, for patients on a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> based regimen, is to switch the maintenance immunosuppressive agent from cyclosporine to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>.
