In the United States, routine childhood immunization has reduced disease incidence, complications, hospital admissions, and deaths in children and in the general population, indicating strong herd immunity. Similar immunization programs have been adopted by several other countries, including Uruguay, Germany, Taiwan, Canada, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-chickenpox/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will address the morbidity and mortality of varicella infection prior to and after immunization.

At the start of the national varicella vaccination program, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended one dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> for children 12 to 18 months of age, older susceptible children (19 months of age through 12 years of age), and high-risk groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-chickenpox/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Further follow-up surveillance confirmed and extended these original findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By 2005, overall varicella incidence in active surveillance sites had declined by 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-chickenpox/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

These findings highlight the benefits of &quot;herd immunity&quot;; this term refers to protection against infection that occurs indirectly for unvaccinated persons when others in the community are immunized.</p><p/><p>Further refinement of the vaccination program occurred in 2006, when the ACIP recommended a second dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> because of a number of varicella outbreaks occurring in highly vaccinated populations of schoolchildren [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-chickenpox/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. After the implementation of the two-dose schedule, the incidence of varicella decreased by 85 percent (from 25.4 per 100,000 population during 2005-2006 to 3.9 per 100,000 population during 2013-2014) in states reporting data to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-chickenpox/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].The largest declines were seen in children and adolescents aged 5 to 14 years.</p><p>These aggregate data also support the use of vaccine in individuals who have been exposed to varicella.
