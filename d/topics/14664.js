It has become the standard for continuous, noninvasive assessment of oxygenation, such that is now known as the &quot;fifth vital sign&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Theoretical and clinical aspects of pulse oximetry will be reviewed here. Other measures of oxygenation, mechanisms of hypoxemia, and use of pulse oximetry in newborns for the detection of congenital heart disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539329364\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES AND EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulse oximetry uses spectrophotometry to determine the proportion of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen (ie, oxygenated hemoglobin; oxyhemoglobin) in peripheral arterial blood. Light, at two separate wavelengths, illuminates oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in blood. The ratio of light absorbance between oxyhemoglobin and the sum of oxyhemoglobin plus deoxyhemoglobin is calculated and compared with previously calibrated direct measurements of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) to establish an estimated measure of peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84192679\"><span class=\"h2\">The Beer-Lambert law</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulse oximetry estimates peripheral SpO<sub>2</sub> using a variation of the Beer-Lambert law. This law states that the absorption of light of a given wavelength passing through a non-absorbing solvent, which contains an absorbing solute, is proportional to the product of the solute concentration, the light path length, and an extinction coefficient. The Beer-Lambert law can readily be applied to co-oximeters used for a static column of arterial for blood gas analysis but needs to be modified to overcome the obstacles associated with interference from tissue and pulsatile flow when measuring SpO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This modification involves measuring absorbance at using two different wavelengths, one to detect oxyhemoglobin and the other to detect deoxyhemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1290945654\"><span class=\"h2\">Probes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulse oximeter probes consist of two light-emitting diodes and a photodetector. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emitters &ndash; Deoxyhemoglobin absorbs light maximally in the red band of the spectrum (600 to 750 nm), and oxyhemoglobin absorbs maximally in the infrared band (850 to 1000 nm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, the emitters emit light at 660 nm and 940 nm for optimal detection of these two substances. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detector &ndash; The detector (also known as sensor) detects the absorbance of light from exposed tissue. The values are processed and a saturation determined. (See <a href=\"#H4232625660\" class=\"local\">'Calibration and calculation'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, detectors and emitters are positioned facing each other through interposed tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F107545\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107545 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Probes are most frequently placed on the anterior and posterior aspect of fingers, toes, or ear lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The nasal ala is another option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In infants, probes may also be placed on the palms, feet, arms, cheeks, tongue, penis, nose, or nasal septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Forehead probes have the emitter and detector adjacent to each other so that saturation is measured from light that is reflected back from (not through) exposed tissue. These sites are preferentially used since they contain a high density of vascular tissue. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although various types are available, none have shown clear superiority over another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Thus when clinicians cannot receive a clear reading with one probe, an alternate probe is often tried. (See <a href=\"#H3929824205\" class=\"local\">'Troubleshooting sources of error'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Some probes are reusable clips, which are low in cost; others are single-patient adhesive probes, which are higher in cost but have less potential to be associated with the transmission of hospital-acquired infections. &#160;</p><p>Transesophageal probes have been developed, and provide data that appear to be less influenced by changes in patient temperature, mean arterial pressure, or peripheral vasoconstriction than probes placed at other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. However, these probes are not routinely used. Another method to measure tissue oxygenation is near infrared spectroscopy. While still investigational, it has the advantage of being able to monitor end-organ oxygenation and would have applications in the emergency or critical care setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The response time varies but is generally delayed for most available probes. As an example, some studies have shown that ear probes and forehead probes respond more quickly to a change in peripheral oxygenation than conventional finger probes (eg, 94 versus 100 seconds for desaturations, and 23 versus 29 seconds for increases in saturations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4232625660\"><span class=\"h2\">Calibration and calculation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The saturation value is calculated using microprocessors that utilize absorbance readings from light-exposed oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. The emitters are switched on and off several hundred times per second [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Absorption during pulsatile flow relates to the characteristics of arterial blood plus background tissue and venous blood, whereas absorption during nonpulsatile flow is due only to the background tissue and venous blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80895\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80895 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Absorption at the two wavelengths during pulsatile flow is divided by absorption during nonpulsatile flow, and these ratios are fed into an algorithm in the microprocessor to yield a saturation value. The displayed value is an average based on the previous three to six seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/6,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19</a>]. In addition to peripheral SpO<sub>2</sub> many pulse oximeters also display pulse rate and relative pulse amplitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>].</p><p/><p>The microprocessors of pulse oximeters are calibrated using reference tables of actual SaO<sub>2</sub> measurements performed using co-oximetry and compiled using data from exposing healthy volunteers to decreasing fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) to yield SaO<sub>2</sub> ranging from 100 to 75 percent. Because it would be unethical to intentionally generate lower saturations in volunteers, values for an SaO<sub>2</sub> less than 75 percent are obtained by extrapolation from these volunteer data. Pulse oximeter manufacturers claim that reported values between 70 and 100 percent are accurate to within &plusmn; 2 percent of the true value, while those between 50 and 70 percent are within &plusmn; 3 percent. In practice, the cut-off for acceptable accuracy is felt by many clinicians to be 80 percent (which usually reflects an arterial oxygen tension [PaO<sub>2</sub>] of approximately 50 mmHg at a pH of 7.4), and varies depending on the model of pulse oximeter used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/4,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,22,23</a>]. The high accuracy of one widely used type of pulse oximeter at SaO<sub>2</sub> values ranging from 82 to 94 percent was confirmed in a study of 100 patients, although the accuracy of the instrument deteriorated at values outside these parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H962473675\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many advantages of pulse oximetry over physical examination and arterial blood gas measurement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rapid</strong> &ndash; Pulse oximetry is a rapid tool that accurately assesses oxygenation, particularly in emergency situations. Oxygenation is difficult to assess on the basis of physical examination alone. Frank cyanosis does not develop until the level of deoxyhemoglobin reaches 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> which corresponds to an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) of around 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, the threshold at which cyanosis becomes apparent is affected by multiple variables including peripheral perfusion, skin pigmentation, and hemoglobin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Similarly, compared with arterial blood gas analysis, pulse oximetry also provides immediate results both before and after oxygen therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Noninvasive</strong> &ndash; Blood gas analysis (via arterial puncture or an indwelling catheter) was for many years the only available method of detecting hypoxemia, but this technique is painful and has potential complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In contrast, pulse oximetry allows noninvasive measurement of arterial hemoglobin saturation, without the risks associated with arterial puncture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arterial-blood-gases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arterial blood gases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arterial-catheterization-techniques-for-invasive-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arterial catheterization techniques for invasive monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Provides continuous data</strong> &ndash; Pulse oximetry, unlike clinical examination and an indwelling arterial catheter, provides continuous data such that oxygen therapy can be easily adjusted to a target level. </p><p/><p>Limitations include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inability to detect hyperoxemia</strong> &ndash; Pulse oximetry is unable to detect significant hyperoxemia. This is due to the shape of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, where large changes in the partial pressure in arterial oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) may result in no change in oxygen saturation if the saturation is already near 100 percent (eg, patient with normal lung function on mechanical ventilation receiving a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1). Therefore, in patients at risk for profound hyperoxemia, SaO<sub>2</sub> by pulse oximeter should be verified by arterial blood gas analysis, to ensure that the partial pressure of arterial oxygen is not unnecessarily high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inability to measure arterial oxygen tension</strong> &ndash; Since pulse oximetry does not measure PaO<sub>2</sub>, overreliance on pulse oximetry can delay detection of clinically significant hypoxemia, in adults but particularly in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A large decrease in PaO<sub>2</sub> will not produce a significant fall in SaO<sub>2</sub> until the steeper portion of the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve is encountered at a PaO<sub>2</sub> of approximately 60 to 70 mmHg. This is particularly important in patients receiving supplemental oxygen. As an example, a fall in PaO<sub>2</sub> in such a patient from 140 to 65 mmHg would be required before a significant decrease in oxygen saturation is detected. Furthermore, pulse oximetry results are signal-averaged over several seconds. Therefore, the pulse oximeter may not detect a hypoxemic event for close to a minute after it has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. This delay may be of particular significance when the device is being used for monitoring during intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inability to measure ventilation</strong> &ndash; While pulse oximetry is a convenient way of measuring arterial oxygenation, it does not measure the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), which is a measure of ventilation. In addition, supplemental oxygen administered on the basis of oximetry alone in patients with hypercapnia may be harmful by worsening hypercapnia (ie, oxygen-induced hypercapnia). Therefore, when hypercapnia or hypoventilation is suspected, an arterial blood gas should be obtained or, alternatively, ventilation can be assessed with end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. As an example, one inadvertently hypoventilated patient who was administered 100 percent oxygen during hip arthroplasty and monitored with pulse oximetry alone developed a PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 265 mmHg and an arterial pH of 6.65, despite maintenance of oxygen saturations of 94 to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

This complication is believed to result from the generation of electrical skin currents beneath the pulse oximeter cables, which act as an antenna.

The clinician should be aware of the limitations and errors associated with pulse oximetry and have a low threshold to obtain arterial blood for analysis.

Conventional pulse oximeters, which use two light emitting diodes can only detect these two substances and cannot detect abnormal forms of hemoglobins. Multi-wavelength co-oximeters use four, rather than two, wavelengths of light to detect oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, and methemoglobin. They require a sample of arterial whole blood and a specific laboratory request for its measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/28,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,38</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Carboxyhemoglobin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H654338674\" class=\"local\">'Glycohemoglobin A1c'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2001541387\" class=\"local\">'Methemoglobin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1573383008\" class=\"local\">'Sulfhemoglobin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3197027306\" class=\"local\">'Sickle hemoglobin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1159201384\" class=\"local\">'Inherited forms of abnormal hemoglobin'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Noninvasive eight wavelength pulse oximeters capable of photo spectroscopic measurements of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/69,107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,107,108</a>]. However, preliminary studies question their accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulse-oximetry/abstract/109,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,110</a>]. Until these devices are validated, they cannot be recommended as a replacement for standard co-oximetry laboratory measurement of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin levels when carboxyhemoglobinemia or methemoglobinemia are suspected.

Pulse oximetry uses spectrophotometry to determine the proportion of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen (ie, oxyhemoglobin) in peripheral arterial blood. A variety of probes are available, none of which have clear superiority over another. (See <a href=\"#H539329364\" class=\"local\">'Principles and equipment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse oximetry is a rapid, noninvasive tool that can provide continuous assessment of oxygenation and is associated with few complications. However, it cannot detect hyperoxemia or arterial oxygen or carbon dioxide tension. (See <a href=\"#H962473675\" class=\"local\">'Advantages and disadvantages'</a> above and <a href=\"#H411369682\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse oximetry is indicated in any setting where hypoxemia may occur. It provides accurate assessment of tissue oxygenation in most patients. However, clinicians should pay attention to trends on oximetry, and when treating patients with supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia, clinicians should target levels that are desirable for the specific etiology, while simultaneously avoiding oxygen toxicity. The clinician should be aware of the limitations and errors associated with pulse oximetry and have a low threshold to obtain arterial blood for analysis. (See <a href=\"#H947968886\" class=\"local\">'Applications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2922130561\" class=\"local\">'Interpreting the results'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse oximetry is subject to artifactual and patient-related sources of error. The best defense against error is a high index of suspicion. If a saturation reading is in doubt, equipment error can be quickly ruled out by putting the probe on the healthcare workers own finger. Once assured that equipment is functioning, the clinician should investigate for other potential sources of error, most of which are readily identified and resolvable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F107546\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107546 \">table 1</a>).
