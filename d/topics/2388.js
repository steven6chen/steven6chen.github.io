Busulfan was the first cytotoxic drug reportedly associated with pulmonary toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The reported patterns of pulmonary toxicity include acute lung injury, chronic interstitial fibrosis, and alveolar hemorrhage. Busulfan is often used in combination with other drugs, many of which cause pulmonary toxicity, which can make it difficult to ascertain which drug is the culprit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Chemotherapy without radiation'</a>.) </p><p>The clinical characteristics of busulfan-induced pulmonary injury will be reviewed here. Pulmonary toxicity caused by other chemotherapeutic agents is discussed separately.

However, the true incidence is unknown; most of the early data in patients treated with busulfan alone for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) consisted of single case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/3-7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7,9,10</a>]. Such treatment is no longer considered a standard approach since the introduction of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Modern data examining the risk of pulmonary toxicity in such patients are derived from series in which patients received busulfan in addition to other myelosuppressive chemotherapy agents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy prior to HCT. The incidence has been variable, and interpretation complicated by competing causes of pulmonary toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/14,16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16-21</a>], particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, 2 of 78 patients (2.5 percent) who received a conditioning regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> prior to autologous HCT developed pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 84 patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> prior to autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplantation, seven patients had severe lung toxicity (8.3 percent), five of whom had also received irradiation to the lung fields [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The number of patients with grade 5 (fatal) interstitial pneumonitis was similar (6 versus 5 percent with <span class=\"nowrap\">Bu/Cy</span> and TBI, respectively).

Fourteen of the 15 had CMV detected on biopsy or at autopsy, and 14 of the 15 died (including 13 with presumed CMV pneumonitis).

In the older literature in which long-term busulfan was administered as monotherapy for CML, most (but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]) cases were described in patients treated for longer than eight months, and the threshold dose beyond which the risk of pulmonary toxicity increased was thought to be approximately 500 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

On the other hand, the risk of busulfan-related toxicity (including pulmonary toxicity) may be reduced by the use of pharmacokinetically-based rather than traditional weight-based dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms of busulfan-induced lung injury are unknown, since adequate animal models do not exist. Direct toxicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> to epithelial lining cells is suggested, but cytologic and histologic findings are nonspecific. Lung biopsy specimens reveal pneumocyte dysplasia (degeneration of type I cells, atypical hyperplastic type II cells), atypical bronchial lining cells, mononuclear cell infiltration, and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26</a>]. Occasionally, severe desquamation of injured epithelial cells into alveolar spaces leads to diffuse alveolar damage in a pattern suggestive of alveolar proteinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Organizing pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage have been described in patients who received busulfan among other agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a single case report, pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage developed after hematopoietic cell transplantation in a patient who received busulfan in combination with other agents as part of a conditioning regimen, although it is not known whether busulfan was causative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with busulfan-induced pulmonary injury commonly complain of cough and progressive dyspnea on exertion.

However, in most cases, pulmonary toxicity is manifest between 30 days and one year posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

One prospective study, for example, evaluated changes in PFTs among 43 patients before and after a conditioning regimen of busulfan plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> prior to HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. DLCO was decreased by 20 and 15 percent upon follow-up examination 3 and 12 months after transplant, respectively. In addition, the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) to the forced vital capacity (FVC) increased, reflecting the development of a restrictive pattern.

Both lymphocytosis and neutrophilia have been reported in BAL from patients with busulfan-induced pulmonary toxicity, in addition to atypia in type I pneumocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/26,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,35</a>]. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage has been associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> in a case report, but is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, it is not uncommon for the BAL findings to be normal. The technique of BAL and the evaluation of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage are discussed separately.

While the presence of cellular atypia establishes that the patient has had significant exposure to busulfan, it does not confirm that the patient's symptoms and radiographic abnormalities are due to the drug.

However, PAP has also developed in patients with CML who were not treated with busulfan and may actually be a feature of the underlying disease related to macrophage dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Furthermore, this complication has not been seen in patients receiving busulfan as a component of the conditioning regimen for HCT.

Given that most patients with busulfan-induced pulmonary toxicity received the drug weeks to months before the diagnosis of lung toxicity, therapy is mainly supportive and includes supplemental oxygen as needed, vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal infection, and pulmonary rehabilitation. Some spontaneous improvement may occur. As an example, in a series of 43 patients who received conditioning with busulfan and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), a 10 percent decrease in lung volumes and a 20 percent decrease in diffusing capacity were found at three months after HCT, but subsequently normal lung volumes and a partial improvement in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were noted at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a followup study, lung volumes and gas transfer were decreased in 43 patients at one year after busulfan, but normalized by five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Anecdotal reports, almost all of which involve patients who were receiving long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), describe responses to systemic glucocorticoids, but no controlled studies are available and some patients had only a transient response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/busulfan-induced-pulmonary-injury/abstract/1,27,28,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,27,28,40,41</a>]. For patients who are believed to have busulfan toxicity following HCT, the decision to initiate glucocorticoid therapy usually depends on the severity and rapidity of worsening of pulmonary impairment and on the pulmonary histopathology, if known. As an example, if the patient has a known histopathology that is usually responsive to glucocorticoids (eg, organizing pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis), it is reasonable to use glucocorticoid therapy as would be done for that disease in other clinical settings. In addition, for patients with rapid deterioration in lung function and no evidence of infection, we initiate a trial of oral glucocorticoids with the equivalent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. If no response is seen within four to six weeks, the glucocorticoids are tapered and stopped. The approach to glucocorticoid therapy for pulmonary toxicity associated with antineoplastic therapy is discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1147763\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1147771\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic pulmonary injury is thought to occur in fewer than 8 percent of patients who receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>; however, the true incidence is unknown. Modern data examining the risk of pulmonary toxicity are derived from patients receiving busulfan in addition to other myelosuppressive chemotherapy agents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation, where the incidence has been variable and interpretation complicated by competing causes of pulmonary toxicity, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis. Nonetheless, the risk of pulmonary injury may be lower in busulfan-containing preparative regimens, compared with those that include total body irradiation. (See <a href=\"#H1147763\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cytologic and histologic findings in busulfan-induced pulmonary toxicity are nonspecific. Lung biopsy specimens reveal pneumocyte dysplasia (degeneration of type I cells, atypical hyperplastic type II cells), atypical bronchial lining cells, mononuclear cell infiltration, and fibrosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of busulfan-induced pulmonary injury typically include cough and progressive dyspnea on exertion. Fever and weight loss may be present. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), radiographic patterns associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> lung toxicity include ground glass opacities, asymmetric peripheral and peribronchial consolidation, centrilobular nodules, and increased reticular markings. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chest imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of busulfan-induced pulmonary toxicity is usually established clinically and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The differential diagnosis includes infection (particularly with CMV), radiation-induced lung injury, pulmonary edema, lung involvement by an underlying malignancy, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and pulmonary hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with suspected lung toxicity due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, the main purpose of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is to exclude other processes such as infection, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and metastatic spread of the underlying cancer. A lung biopsy is indicated when the patient has progressive or severe disease and the cause of the pneumonitis is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-systemic-antineoplastic-therapy-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-treatment#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary toxicity associated with systemic antineoplastic therapy: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with busulfan-induced pulmonary toxicity, the main therapeutic intervention is supportive care. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with moderate to severe busulfan-induced pulmonary toxicity (eg, dyspnea at rest, a decrease in oxygen saturation below 90 percent or more than 4 percent decrease from baseline, or worsening clinical status) and no evidence of infection, we suggest administering systemic glucocorticoid therapy, rather than observation and supportive care alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The initial dose is the equivalent of oral&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily; intravenous glucocorticoids may be used initially.
