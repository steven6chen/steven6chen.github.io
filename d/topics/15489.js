Sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70403\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70403 \">picture 1</a>) may be mistaken for inflammatory lesions, such as chalazion or blepharoconjunctivitis, resulting in a delayed diagnosis and poorer prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Sebaceous carcinomas can occur sporadically or may be associated with Muir-Torre syndrome, a subset of the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNCCS, Lynch syndrome) characterized by single or multiple sebaceous neoplasms, keratoacanthomas, and internal malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of sebaceous carcinoma.

However, sebaceous carcinoma is the most common eyelid malignancy after basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>A review of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database from 1973 to 2004 identified 1349 cases of sebaceous carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. More than 90 percent of cases were seen in patients over 50 years old and the median age was 72 years. Sebaceous carcinoma is exceedingly rare in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Patients with sebaceous carcinoma have an increased risk of developing a subsequent visceral malignancy. In a series of 664 cases of sebaceous carcinoma, the overall risk of a subsequent cancer was 43 percent higher than in the general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 1.43, 95% CI 1.15-1.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The risk was much higher in patients diagnosed with sebaceous carcinoma before the age of 50 (SIR 4.58; 95% CI, 2.44-7.84) than in older patients (SIR 1.28; 95% CI 1.02-1.60).

There are several reports of sebaceous carcinoma arising within a nevus sebaceous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The origin of extraocular sebaceous carcinoma is less clear. The observation of sebaceous carcinoma in association with actinic keratosis or Bowen disease, suggests that extraocular sebaceous carcinoma may originate from a preexisting intraepidermal neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. </p><p>The molecular pathogenesis of sebaceous carcinoma is incompletely understood. Tumors associated with Muir-Torre syndrome show loss of mismatch repair (MMR) gene expression and microsatellite instability (MSI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Loss of <em>MSH2</em>, <em>MSH6</em>, or <em>MLH1</em> gene expression is seen in sebaceous carcinomas associated with Muir-Torre syndrome, as well as in hereditary Lynch-syndrome-associated cancers. Loss of expression of <em>MSH2</em> and microsatellite instability have also been detected in sebaceous carcinomas in organ transplant recipients, suggesting that immunosuppression may unmask a Muir-Torre phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=muir-torre-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Muir-Torre syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sporadic sebaceous carcinomas usually do not show microsatellite instability and loss of mismatch repair gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>]. P53&nbsp;mutations without a UV signature have been found in a high proportion of sporadic sebaceous carcinomas, suggesting that p53 may be involved in tumor initiation and progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/6,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18,19</a>]. Studies have suggested a role for the <span class=\"nowrap\">Wnt/beta-catenin</span> (a 92-kDa molecule involved in cell-cell adhesion in adherens junctions) pathway and the downstream target lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF-1) in the pathogenesis of sebaceous carcinoma, irrespective of the microsatellite status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>]. Hypermethylation of the <em>CDKN2A</em> promoter region has also been found with high frequency in periocular sebaceous carcinoma occurring at a younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65628321\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sebaceous carcinoma typically presents as a firm, gradually enlarging subcutaneous nodule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F98669\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98669 \">picture 2</a>). Approximately 80 percent of cases occur in the skin of the head or neck, and approximately 40 percent involve the eyelids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256433439\"><span class=\"h2\">Eyelid sebaceous carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eyelid sebaceous carcinoma typically presents as a painless, rounded nodule, most often located on the upper eyelid.

Sebaceous carcinomas can occur sporadically or may be associated with Muir-Torre syndrome, a subset of the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNCCS, Lynch syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H65628295\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H65628301\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyelid sebaceous carcinoma typically presents as a painless, rounded nodule, most often located on the upper eyelid. Occasionally, the lesion can be inflamed and painful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70403\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70403 \">picture 1</a>), and may be mistaken clinically for a chalazion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81651\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81651 \">picture 5B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H65628321\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma is suspected in older patients with a history of recalcitrant chalazion or unilateral blepharoconjunctivitis that does not respond to standard treatment. A lesion biopsy for histopathologic examination is required to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H65628339\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of patients with sebaceous carcinoma should include a careful examination of the tumor site and palpation of the regional lymph nodes. Enlarged lymph nodes should be biopsied. Patients with sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelids should be referred to an ophthalmologist for slit-lamp biomicroscopy and conjunctival map biopsies to evaluate for intraepithelial disease. (See <a href=\"#H25153657\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and staging'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest wide local excision with frozen section margin control or Mohs micrographic surgery as the first-line treatment for sebaceous carcinoma of the head and neck region, including eyelid tumors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Conjunctival epithelial involvement may be treated with surgical resection of the bulbar epithelium, cryotherapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C. (See <a href=\"#H65628333\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sebaceous-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kyllo RL, Brady KL, Hurst EA.
