Diabetic nephropathy was the etiology of ESRD in approximately 23 percent of kidney transplant recipients transplanted in the United States in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Diabetes presents particular challenges both in the pretransplant evaluation and after transplantation. These challenges are related to the high incidence of cardiovascular disease among diabetic patients and the increased risk of bacterial and fungal infections compared with nondiabetic transplant recipients.</p><p>In addition, glycemic control is often more difficult after transplantation. This is because immunosuppressive regimens used after transplantation have detrimental effects on pancreatic beta-cell function and peripheral insulin action, which make it difficult to achieve target glucose levels and prevent the recurrence of the diabetic lesions in the transplanted kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The major issues related to renal transplantation in diabetic patients with ESRD are discussed in this topic review. The role of combined kidney-pancreas transplantation is discussed separately. New-onset diabetes that occurs after renal transplantation is also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and complications associated with kidney-pancreas transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-selection-for-and-immunologic-issues-relating-to-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient selection for and immunologic issues relating to kidney-pancreas transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) in renal transplant recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS OF TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidney transplantation is the preferred renal replacement therapy for diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) since it generally results in better survival and quality of life than dialysis. We recommend that diabetic patients who are eligible receive a kidney transplant rather than continue dialysis. Pre-emptive kidney transplantation rather than initiation of dialysis followed by transplantation is preferred, and, if possible, a living-donor kidney is preferred to a deceased-donor kidney. We also suggest that all waitlisted diabetic patients register on both the standard-donor waitlist and the expanded-criteria-donor (ECD) waitlist. Although ECD kidneys do not meet the criteria for standard-donor kidneys, diabetic patients who receive them are likely to live longer than if they remained on dialysis.<br/></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1212465755\"><span class=\"h2\">Transplantation versus dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For eligible candidates, we recommend kidney transplantation rather than dialysis. Compared with dialysis, transplantation is associated with a much better survival among all patients with ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/3-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-10</a>]. In one of the largest, most comprehensive studies to date, survival analysis using data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) was performed on nearly 230,000 dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; among the 46,000 placed on a waiting list for transplantation, 23,000 subsequently underwent a first cadaveric transplant. Despite a significantly <strong>increased</strong> short-term mortality following surgery, the long-term risk of death was much lower among transplant recipients compared with patients accepted for transplantation but who had not yet received an allograft. As an example, at three to four years, the mortality risk was nearly 70 percent lower among transplant recipients compared with waitlist patients (relative risk [RR] 0.32).</p><p>Diabetes was the cause of ESRD among 33 percent of the 46,164 patients on the transplant waiting list and 31 percent of the 23,275 transplant recipients. At 18 months posttransplantation, the subset of 7200 diabetic transplant recipients had a 73 percent reduced risk of death compared with the approximately 15,000 diabetic waitlisted patients (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.24-0.30). The projected increase in life was 11 years among diabetic patients who undergo transplantation compared with diabetics who remain on the waiting list.</p><p>Another study from Scotland reported the survival of 1732 patients waitlisted for a first kidney transplant in 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among approximately 250 diabetic patients, at 12 months after transplantation, the risk of death was lower with renal transplantation compared with dialysis (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.74). Projected life expectancy was significantly higher in those who underwent transplantation (17.2 versus 5.8 years).</p><p>The reduction in mortality among transplant recipients compared with dialysis patients is due in part to a decrease in cardiovascular events, especially among diabetic patients. Transplantation reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular complications compared with long-term dialysis among patients selected to be suitable transplant candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1212465762\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-emptive transplantation and living-donor versus deceased kidneys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend pre-emptive kidney transplantation if possible, rather than initiation of dialysis followed by transplantation. Among all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), evidence suggests that pre-emptive kidney transplantation (ie, before dialysis is required) leads to substantial improvements in patient survival when compared with transplantation after a period of dialysis therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation#H611130028\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis issues prior to and after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Indications for preemptive transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>Limited evidence also suggests that diabetic patients with CKD have a survival advantage with pre-emptive transplantation. In an analysis of 73,103 patients registered in the USRDS database including almost 20,000 diabetic patients, compared with preemptive transplantation, there was a relative increase in mortality risk after transplantation of 21, 28, 41, 53, and 72 percent among those with waiting times of 6 to 12, 12 to 24, 24 to 36, 36 to 48, and over 48 months, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Similarly, relative to pre-emptive transplants, waiting times of 0 to 6, 6 to 12, 12 to 24, and over 24 months conferred a 17, 37, 55, and 68 percent relative increase in risk for death-censored graft loss after transplantation, respectively. The association between mortality risk and graft loss and increasing time on dialysis was observed for all subgroups defined by the cause of ESRD, including patients with diabetes.</p><p>It is not clear whether the benefits of pre-emptive transplantation among diabetic patients are achieved when either living-donor or deceased-donor kidneys are used. In the study cited above, pre-emptive transplantation was associated with better patient and allograft survival among both living-donor kidneys and deceased-donor recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, another study has suggested that the benefit of pre-emptive transplantation is limited to living-donor recipients. In a retrospective study of over 20,000 diabetic patients, a lower mortality was observed among recipients of pre-emptive kidney transplants from living donors (with RRs of 0.57 and 0.65 for recipients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively), but this association was <strong>NOT</strong> observed among either type 1 or type 2 diabetic recipients of cadaveric donor kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In practice, pre-emptive transplantation with a deceased-donor kidney is rarely performed because of prolonged waiting-list times. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The kidney transplant waiting list in the United States&quot;, section on 'Access to the waiting list'</a>.)</p><p>Living-donor kidney transplantation provides better outcomes, including graft and patient survival, compared with simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation. Issues surrounding patient survival relating to kidney-pancreas transplantation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and complications associated with kidney-pancreas transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1212466317\"><span class=\"h2\">Expanded-criteria kidneys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that all waitlisted diabetic patients register on both the standard-donor waitlist and the ECD waitlist.</p><p>ECD kidneys are those from either a brain-dead donor older than 60 years or a donor older than 50 years with at least two of the following: hypertension, serum creatinine greater than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> or cerebrovascular cause of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Among all dialysis patients, transplantation of an ECD kidney is associated with a higher risk of allograft failure compared with transplantation of a standard-donor kidney, but with a lower mortality compared with remaining on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Upon registering on the deceased-donor waiting list, potential recipients must state whether they will accept offers of an ECD kidney.</p><p>The potential benefit gained by all ECD transplant recipients depends upon the patient&rsquo;s age and on the anticipated waiting time for a deceased-donor kidney; in general, older patients incur a survival benefit with ECD kidneys, whereas patients younger than 40 years are better off waiting for a standard kidney. This was shown in an in-depth analysis of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although transplantation of an ECD kidney was associated with a survival benefit overall, subgroup analysis demonstrated a significant benefit for older than, but not younger than, 40 years. In addition, the survival benefit among patients older than 40 years was not observed among those who were waitlisted at organ procurement organizations with short or medium waitlist times.</p><p>However, among diabetic patients of any age, there may be a survival advantage gained from accepting an ECD kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In the study cited above, among all diabetic patients, there was a 23 percent reduction in mortality among recipients of an ECD transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. By contrast to nondiabetic patients older than 40 years, a survival benefit was even observed among diabetic patients older than 40 years who were waitlisted at organ procurement organizations with short or medium waitlist times (RR, 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.94). In addition, among 2016 diabetic patients who were younger than 40 years and in an organ procurement organization with a short or medium waiting time, transplantation of an ECD kidney was associated with a 41 percent reduction in mortality (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.30-1.16).</p><p>Similarly, diabetic patients benefit from transplantation of kidneys donated after cardiac death, which are generally perceived to have worse outcomes compared with standard-criteria kidneys donated after noncardiac death. This was shown in an observational cohort study of 2575 ESRD patients that evaluated the mortality risk of those who received a standard-criteria kidney donated after cardiac death versus patients who continued on dialysis and waited for a standard-criteria kidney donated after brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Approximately 29 percent of patients had diabetes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension. Compared with those who remained on dialysis, mortality was significantly lower among patients who received a kidney donated after cardiac death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.44, 95% CI 0.24-0.80).</p><p>Thus, survival of diabetic patients, especially those over age 40 years, is generally improved following transplantation of ECD kidneys compared with remaining on dialysis while awaiting a standard kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETRANSPLANT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General issues related to pretransplant evaluation of all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;</a>). The following section reviews several issues of particular concern among patients with diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative <span class=\"nowrap\">(K/DOQI)</span> guidelines that recommend referral of CKD patients to transplant centers when estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death following kidney transplantation among diabetic patients, and the highest rates of adverse cardiac events are observed in the early posttransplant period. Diabetic transplant candidates are screened for coronary heart disease in order to identify modifiable cardiac conditions and potentially reduce morbidity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mortality on the waitlist and following transplantation. Additionally, the evaluation may identify patients who have limited expected survival due to severe cardiac disease; such patients should not undergo transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617455917\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevalence of cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among all kidney transplant candidates, the incidence of coronary heart disease varies based on the specific population studied and the screening method utilized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The reported incidence of significant cardiac disease among asymptomatic diabetic patients who are evaluated for transplantation is approximately 33 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 155 consecutive diabetic patients evaluated for transplant between 1999 and 2004, angiographic evidence of significant coronary heart disease (&gt;50 percent luminal diameter stenosis) was found in 69 patients (45 percent), with only 26 (17 percent) having history of angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The only risk factor of significance was age, with no patient under the age of 35 years (n = 11) with significant coronary heart disease. The degree of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and smoking history did not differ between those with and without documented coronary disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 97 asymptomatic diabetic transplant candidates, 33 and 48 percent of type 1 and 2 diabetes patients had coronary heart disease, respectively, as defined by &gt;70 percent stenosis in one or more coronary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Factors that predicted significant coronary heart disease included obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;25, relative risk [RR] 4.8), increased age (&gt;47 years, RR 3.0), and smoking history (2 percent increase in risk per pack-year of smoking).</p><p/><p>In light of the high prevalence of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease, preoperative screening is routine at most transplant centers, although there have been attempts to develop clinical algorithms to identify high-risk candidates. As an example, one such algorithm was developed and validated in a retrospective study of type 1 diabetic patients who were being evaluated for either solitary kidney or combined kidney-pancreas transplantation between 1991 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Patients were characterized as high risk based upon the presence of any of the following risk factors: age &ge;45 years, smoking history &ge;5 pack-years, diabetes duration &ge;25 years, or ST-T segment abnormalities on resting electrocardiogram.</p><p>Among 84 high-risk patients who underwent angiography, significant coronary heart disease was detected in 31 (37 percent). At a median follow-up of 47 months, six cardiac deaths occurred in the high-risk group, and no deaths occurred in the low-risk group, although survival among the high-risk patients was not different among those with or without significant disease detected by angiography.</p><p>Coronary calcium scores have been suggested as a surrogate marker of cardiac risk, but this has not been extensively studied. A small study compared 45 type 2 diabetic individuals on hemodialysis with 45 matched type 2 diabetics without diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There were no observed differences in coronary calcium risk categories between the two groups. We suggest that coronary calcium scores not be used in screening decisions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2217195\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach to evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal approach to the diabetic kidney transplant recipient is not clear, and there are no reliable comparative studies in this cohort to guide the evaluation. Some clinicians base their approach on the age of the patient, duration of diabetes mellitus and smoking history, and presence or absence of electrocardiographic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>We perform noninvasive cardiac testing in all diabetic patients, regardless of age. We do not routinely perform cardiac catheterization in all diabetic patients, unless they have symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs consistent with coronary heart disease, history of myocardial infarction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unstable angina. The data on patient survival do not unequivocally support the use of routine pretransplant cardiac catheterization, especially given the potential adverse effects of cardiac catheterization, including contrast nephropathy, which could result in the earlier initiation of dialysis than may have occurred otherwise. Some clinicians, however, use routine cardiac catheterization among all diabetic patients older than 45 years of age.</p><p>The accuracy and predictive value of noninvasive testing is only fair in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population. We generally use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography rather than other noninvasive tests since data have suggested that this modality is most accurate among ESRD patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coronary heart disease in end-stage renal disease (dialysis)&quot;, section on 'Noninvasive testing'</a>.)</p><p>We suggest the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All diabetic transplant candidates are evaluated with a history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and chest radiograph.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic patients who have symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs consistent with coronary heart disease or a history of myocardial infarction undergo cardiac catheterization unless they recently underwent successful revascularization. As in the non-ESRD population, patients with unstable angina should undergo cardiac catheterization.

If positive, the decision to proceed with angiography and possible angioplasty or surgery is usually made in conjunction with the patients' cardiologist.</p><p/><p>As noted above, the overall accuracy and predictive value of noninvasive testing is only fair in the ESRD population, with accuracy of the different noninvasive imaging tests being center specific and dependent upon the expertise of the examiner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. There are also problems associated with advanced kidney disease, including baseline abnormalities on the electrocardiogram and thallium scintigraphy and a frequent inability of patients to perform adequately during an exercise test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, exercise electrocardiography and exercise echocardiography are not generally recommended, because of poor exercise capabilities in the dialysis population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The optimal approach to noninvasive imaging in dialysis patients is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coronary heart disease in end-stage renal disease (dialysis)&quot;, section on 'Noninvasive testing'</a>.)</p><p>Among transplantation candidates, dobutamine-induced stress echocardiography appears to be more sensitive than other noninvasive tests, including vasodilator-induced stress nuclear scintigraphy. In one study of 125 candidates (39 percent diabetic patients), all patients underwent coronary angiography, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography, and resting and exercise electrocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Independent predictors of severe coronary artery disease (defined as luminal stenosis &gt;70 percent by visual estimation in at least one epicardial artery) were a positive stress echo result (odds ratio [OR] 23, 95% CI 6-88) or an abnormal resting electrocardiogram (OR 7, 95% CI 2-34). Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of dobutamine stress echocardiography was approximately 75 percent.</p><p>Dobutamine-induced stress echocardiography may also be used to stratify cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. This was assessed in a meta-analysis that evaluated the prognostic value of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography (four trials) and thallium scintigraphy (four studies with pharmacologic stress and four with exercise stress) in dialysis patients undergoing assessment for kidney or kidney-pancreas transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Overall, positive tests, compared with negative tests, resulted in a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction (RR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97) and coronary death (RR 2.92, 95% CI 1.66-5.12). Among diabetic patients, subgroup analyses found that positive tests were also associated with a higher risk of coronary death (RR 3.95, 95% CI 1.48-10.5) and myocardial infarction (RR 2.68, 95% CI 0.95-7.57). Both reversible and fixed defects were associated with poor prognosis in diabetic patients with ESRD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1393888242\"><span class=\"h3\">Intervention following positive screening test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implicit in the rationale for screening is that intervention will improve outcomes. The optimal intervention for diabetic transplant candidates who have asymptomatic coronary heart disease is not known. In one study, published in 1992, 151 consecutive asymptomatic type 1 diabetic patients were screened prior to transplantation with cardiac catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Significant disease as defined by stenosis &gt;75 percent in one or more coronary arteries was identified in 31 patients, of which 26 agreed to be randomized to either medical therapy (calcium channel blocker plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) or intervention (angioplasty or bypass). Ten of 13 medically managed patients had an adverse coronary event versus 2 out of 13 revascularized patients in a median follow-up of 8.4 months. In addition, 4 out of 13 medically managed patients died of myocardial infarction during the two-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Diabetic nephropathy is the etiology of ESRD in approximately 23 percent of kidney transplant recipients transplanted in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney transplantation is generally the optimal renal replacement therapy for diabetic patients with ESRD. Among all diabetic patients with ESRD who are eligible for transplantation, we recommend a kidney transplant rather than dialysis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1212465755\" class=\"local\">'Transplantation versus dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The timing of transplantation influences patient survival; patients who undergo transplantation without ever starting dialysis have decreased mortality compared with those who are dialyzed prior to transplantation. Among predialysis diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are eligible for transplantation, we recommend, whenever possible, pre-emptive kidney transplantation rather than initiation of dialysis followed by transplantation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Living-donor kidneys are preferred to deceased-donor kidneys. (See <a href=\"#H1212465762\" class=\"local\">'Pre-emptive transplantation and living-donor versus deceased kidneys'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The wait-time for an expanded-criteria-donor (ECD) kidney may be less than that for a standard-donor kidney. Diabetic patients who receive ECD kidneys appear to be likely to live longer than if they remained on dialysis, although the ECD kidney may not be of the same quality as a standard-donor kidney. We suggest that all waitlisted diabetic patients register on both the standard-donor waitlist and the ECD waitlist (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1212466317\" class=\"local\">'Expanded-criteria kidneys'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the goal of pre-emptive transplantation, diabetics should be referred to a transplant center when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Timing of referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To help detect coronary heart disease and perhaps lower the risk of adverse effects with transplantation, diabetic patients with ESRD are evaluated for the presence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> absence of coronary heart disease. The optimal approach is unclear. We suggest the following approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2217195\" class=\"local\">'Approach to evaluation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All diabetic transplant candidates are evaluated with a history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and chest radiograph.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diabetic patients who have symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs consistent with coronary heart disease or a history of myocardial infarction undergo cardiac catheterization unless they recently underwent successful revascularization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diabetic patients who do not undergo initial screening coronary angiography have a screening <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography. If positive, the decision to proceed with angiography and possible angioplasty or surgery is usually made in conjunction with the patients' cardiologist.
