It is not associated with cigarette smoking.

DAD is a reaction pattern that occurs in response to a number of known causes of lung injury, but in the case of AIP, it is idiopathic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54819 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. DAD has characteristic temporal phases in its evolution &mdash; acute exudative, organizing proliferative, and healed (or fibrotic) phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81916\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81916 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>].

The most characteristic features of AIP are those found during the organizing, &quot;proliferative&quot; stage of DAD and include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked thickening of the alveolar septa due to interstitial edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, fibroblast proliferation (within the interstitium and airspaces), and type II cell hyperplasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63702%7EPULM%2F53033%7EPULM%2F77085\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63702 graphicRef53033 graphicRef77085 \">picture 1A-C</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collapse and apposition of adjacent alveolar septa</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyaline membranes (most prominent during the acute phase) in focal areas along alveolar septa</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombi in small arteries</p><p/><p>The healing phase of AIP may show no apparent residue or may reveal variable degrees of interstitial fibrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> airway scarring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70758\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70758 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>An important feature of AIP is the presence of a <strong>temporally uniform</strong> lesion, which suggests that an episode of acute lung injury occurred at a single time point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This differs from usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), in which pathologic lesions are of different ages with alternating areas of normal lung, interstitial inflammation, fibroblast foci, and honeycomb change. However, the clinical course of patients with UIP may be complicated by &quot;acute exacerbations&quot; or an &quot;accelerated phase of rapid clinical decline&quot; without an identifiable cause. When this occurs, pathologic findings of both AIP and UIP are noted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias: Clinical manifestations and pathology&quot;, section on 'Usual interstitial pneumonia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Acute exacerbations'</a>.)</p><p>In a small autopsy series, marked myofibroblast proliferation was seen in the lungs of all patients with AIP, but was inconsistently seen in patients with infectious causes of ARDS and was mild in patients with ARDS from drug toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Pathologic evidence of multiorgan failure was absent in AIP, but uniformly present in patients with infection and inconsistently present in those with drug-induced toxicity.

Based on studies of animal models and human bronchoalveolar lavage, it is believed that the following sequence of events contributes to the clinical picture of AIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The rapid onset of a widespread injury pattern suggests a single insult as an initiating factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Alveolar epithelial cell damage and death lead to elaboration and release of mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and monocyte chemoattractant factor. Recruitment of neutrophils into the alveolar spaces and alveolar septae leads to further cellular damage, possibly via release of toxic oxygen radicals and proteases. Undoubtedly, other inflammatory cells contribute to progression of the epithelial cell injury and airspace exudation. The extent of epithelial cell injury and basement membrane damage may modulate the nature and extent of the subsequent fibroblastic response in AIP.</p><p>Following the acute phase, a stage of organization ensues that is characterized by fibroblast proliferation and connective tissue synthesis. The hyaline membranes are resorbed or incorporated into the alveolar septa and are overgrown by proliferating type II epithelial cells.</p><p>In patients with a fibrotic response, fibroblast proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblasts leads to production of collagen, widening of the alveolar septae, and organization of the alveolar exudate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Alveolar wall collapse and apposition, associated with reepithelization of the fibrotic exudate within the alveolar space, contribute to the severity and extent of the fibrotic process. Resolution of the injury occurs in some patients, others develop a progressive fibrotic response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of AIP is usually rapid, with a prodromal illness that typically lasts 7 to 14 days prior to presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. The most common presenting signs and symptoms are fever, cough, and progressive, severe shortness of breath, affecting 75, 79, and 90 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/3,8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,13</a>]. The majority will have hypoxemia at presentation and most will require intubation and mechanical ventilation within a few days. Patients may also report prodromal symptoms of myalgias, arthralgias, chills, and malaise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Tachypnea and diffuse crackles are frequently present on lung examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Digital clubbing is typically not seen. The presence of clubbing suggests that the AIP is occurring as an exacerbation of underlying fibrotic disease, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The majority of patients will undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. Depending on whether the oxygen saturation can be adequately maintained with supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula, this may require intubation and supportive ventilation.</p><p>Samples from the BAL are sent for cell counts, cultures (eg, bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, viral), enzyme immunoassay, direct immunofluorescence, and cytologic analysis (eg, viral inclusion bodies, malignant cells).

We favor obtaining a video-assisted lung biopsy early in the course, in the hopes of identifying a treatable process.</p><p>Some clinicians may choose to perform a transbronchial biopsy first to assess for sarcoidosis, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and alveolar proteinosis, prior to proceeding to VATS or open biopsy.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of AIP is usually rapid, with a prodromal illness of 7 to 14 days. The most common clinical signs and symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of AIP includes heart failure, the diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (also known as idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and diffuse alveolar damage of known cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54819 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of AIP is based upon the presence of a clinical syndrome of idiopathic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) AND histologic confirmation of diffuse alveolar damage. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main treatment of AIP is supportive care. Noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation is often required, as most patients develop respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a diagnosis of AIP, we suggest initiating high dose systemic glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The usual dose of glucocorticoids is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 2 gm per day intravenously in divided doses for the first several days. We typically administer empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics simultaneously. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The in-hospital mortality from AIP is high (greater than 50 percent).
