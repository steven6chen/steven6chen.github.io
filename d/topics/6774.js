For example, a large body of clinical and experimental evidence that indicates an important role for the autonomic nervous system in the triggering or sustaining of malignant ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

HRV is influenced significantly by age, race, sex, physical fitness, clinical conditions, and drug treatment, but most 24-hour HRV appears to be stable when measured on a day-to-day basis and over periods of days to weeks when there are no major intervening clinical events.</p><p>This topic will review selected technical aspects and some clinical applications of HRV testing,&nbsp;a low-cost, widely available, non-invasive method for assessing cardiac autonomic function. Although measurements are actually based on the RR interval (cardiac interbeat interval obtained from a continuous ECG recording and usually from the normal sinus to normal sinus [NN] intervals), the term &quot;HRV,&quot; instead of &quot;RRV,&quot; has entered the lexicon and will be used here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H322294\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM INTERACTIONS WITH CARDIAC RATE AND RHYTHM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Modulation of heart rate and the autonomic nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The autonomic nervous system is the primary regulator of heart rate in the presence of sinus rhythm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69693 \">figure 1</a>). The intrinsic sinus node rate at rest (ie, the rate after pharmacologic or surgical denervation of the sinus node) is 95 to 110 beats per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Under normal supine resting conditions, there is little efferent sympathetic neural input to the sinoatrial node, and the concentration of circulating catecholamines is low; however, there is substantial efferent parasympathetic traffic on the vagus nerves, which slows the sinus node rate to 60 to 70 beats per minute in most adults. Keep in mind that resting heart rate is determined by both sympathetic and parasympathetic tone (ie, the basic firing rate of the nerves). Heart rate variability (HRV) measures the fluctuations in the RR intervals (also referred to as NN intervals for presumed sinus beats) related primarily to autonomic control mechanisms, but it does not measure autonomic &quot;tone&quot; per se, despite the many erroneous claims to the contrary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Instead, HRV reflects the extraordinarily complex, nonlinear interplay of all of the feedback loops, autonomic and nonautonomic, which regulate sinus node pacemaker activity and facilitate the matching of cardiac output to the needs of the body. Therefore, interpretations equating specific HRV measures to specific neuroautonomic mechanisms are, of necessity, simplifications.</p><p>Analysis of HRV patterns from continuous electrocardiograms (ECGs) permits the identification and measurement of underlying physiologic rhythms. The strength of these rhythms is expressed by the magnitude of various frequency-domain HRV measures. When recordings of at least 24 hours are available, the predominant physiologic rhythm that accounts for the most HRV is the circadian rhythm, with relatively increased sympathetic activity associated with higher heart rates during the daytime and increased vagal activity associated with lower heart rates during the night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. During normal sleep, there are also prominent physiologic rhythms associated with each approximately 90-minute sleep cycle, and there is evidence that these rhythms persist during wake time, possibly in association with neuroendocrine rhythms, but ultradian HRV measures have not found clinical applications at this point. (See <a href=\"#H2012840347\" class=\"local\">'HRV methodology, definitions, and normal values'</a> below.)</p><p>Baroreflex activity (oscillations at relatively low frequencies that include so-called Mayer waves) also causes concomitant fluctuations in heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These baroreflex changes are most apparent with sudden standing or during tilt. Finally, rhythmic fluctuations in the frequency of impulse conduction along the vagus nerves, modulated by the rate and depth of breathing, result, among supine subjects with adequate autonomic functioning, in substantial variations in RR intervals at higher frequencies known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia&nbsp;(RSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. RSA can be exaggerated during metronomic breathing or with meditation-related slow breathing rates.</p><p>RR interval fluctuations are also affected by mental or physical activities and responses to environmental stressors, which reduce the average frequency of impulses conducted along the vagus nerves and, as effort increases, increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. In some individuals, changes related to sleep-disordered breathing events, periodic limb movements, restless legs syndrome, or poor sleep can exaggerate HRV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Non-autonomic factors (eg, neuroendocrine function) also play an important role in modulating HRV, and some HRV can be exaggerated by an abnormally irregular sinus rhythm due to sinus node dysfunction or subtle atrial ectopy (erratic supraventricular rhythm) that is often missed in routine assessments, especially in older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal sinus rhythm and sinus arrhythmia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012840208\"><span class=\"h2\">Triggering of cardiac arrhythmias and the autonomic nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both branches of the autonomic nervous system have an important role in the triggering or sustaining of malignant ventricular arrhythmias, particularly post-myocardial infarction (MI). This relationship partly explains the predictive value of abnormal HR variability for such events to the extent that the arrhythmogenesis is a consequence of alterations in autonomic functioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23881498\"><span class=\"h3\">The sympathetic nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronically increased sympathetic activity and elevated plasma catecholamines can be found in the setting of myocardial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. These alter the electrophysiologic properties of the myocardium and promote arrhythmogenesis, regardless of the mechanism involved (enhanced automaticity, triggered activity, or reentry) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Some of the arrhythmogenic effects of high sympathetic activity are related to the adverse effects of tachycardia, such as ischemia, while others result from heterogeneity of ventricular repolarization.</p><p>Increased sympathetic activity can cause tachycardia, which can result in myocardial ischemia, but myocardial ischemia, independent of the underlying mechanism, usually increases sympathetic activity while decreasing efferent vagal activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Additionally, myocardial ischemia triggers a release of norepinephrine from epicardial sympathetic nerves and an increase in its local myocardial concentrations due to the high extracellular potassium concentrations in the ischemic regions, resulting in regional heterogeneity of depolarization and repolarization, which is an important precondition for the development of reentrant activity and the precipitation of ventricular fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Myocardial infarction can also involve the epicardial sympathetic nerves, producing regional sympathetic denervation of the myocardium distal to the infarct and further enhancing heterogeneity of repolarization and increasing the potential for reentry during times of enhanced sympathetic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The noninfarcted tissue responds normally to sympathetic stimulation with a shortening of the ventricular refractory period, while denervated tissue fails to respond. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23881505\"><span class=\"h3\">The parasympathetic nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parasympathetic nervous system, through vagal innervation, may exert important antiarrhythmic effects by reducing the heart rate and counteracting the proarrhythmic effects of sympathetic nervous system activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. Furthermore, the parasympathetic nervous system appears to play a large role in regulating the inflammatory response, and RR variability is inversely related to the production of many inflammatory markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Our understanding of the action of the vagus nerve, however, has been extremely simplistic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Physiologically, as the vagus emerges from the brainstem, it can be visualized anatomically as having two branches: a supradiaphragmatic branch providing neural pathways to organs above the diaphragm and a subdiaphragmatic branch providing pathways to organs below the diaphragm. The vagal motor fibers traveling through the supradiaphragmatic branch predominantly are myelinated and originate in the nucleus ambiguus. By contrast, the vagal motor fibers traveling through the subdiaphragmatic branch are predominantly unmyelinated and originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus. Both source nuclei are located in the brainstem with the nucleus ambiguus being ventral to the dorsal nucleus of the vagus. In close proximity to the dorsal nucleus of the vagus is the nucleus tractus solitarius, which serves as the nucleus of the sensory vagal pathways that travel through both branches of the vagus.&nbsp;Through the process of evolution and the transition from reptiles to mammals, there was a transition in how vagal motor pathways regulated the heart. Originally, the heart was regulated by the unmyelinated vagal fibers originating in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus, but with the appearance of mammals, the predominant vagal motor regulation of the heart shifted to myelinated vagal fibers originating in the nucleus ambiguus. This evolutionary process provided a layering of neural circuits involved in the regulation of the heart consistent with the Jacksonian principle of dissolution, which emphasized a disinhibition of phylogenetically older neural pathways as an adaptive response to illness, injury, and threat.</p><p>From this perspective, in humans (and other mammals), activation of the &quot;older,&quot; unmyelinated vagus mediates, among other things, the immobility and bradycardia responses associated with severe threat, and possibly some of the slower rhythms of HRV. At the same time, activity of the &quot;newer,&quot; myelinated branch is associated with respiratory sinus arrhythmia and a vagal &quot;brake&quot; on heart rate. At the same time, this newer branch of the vagus is associated with the capability to rapidly release the vagal brake and increase heart rate in the presence of increased demand and also with the ability to recover rapidly to baseline. This conceptual perspective, known as polyvagal theory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], is beginning to be incorporated into a more nuanced understanding of the parasympathetic nervous system in the context of increased interest in clinical devices and interventions that appear to increase vagal activity.</p><p>As can be seen from the polyvagal perspective, it is simplistic to assume that &quot;higher parasympathetic activity is always better&quot; since excess vagal activation can result in syncope, heart block, and potentially, in some cases, increase dispersion of atrial refractoriness resulting in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Abnormally enhanced vagal activity can also be associated with inferior-posterior type MIs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012840347\"><span class=\"h1\">HRV METHODOLOGY, DEFINITIONS, AND NORMAL VALUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart rate variability (HRV) is derived from intervals between normal sinus heart beats (NNs) and can be quantified by many methods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79145\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79145 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/5,18,33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18,33-38</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time domain measures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency domain measures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart rate turbulence</p><p/><p>In addition, newer methods based on nonlinear dynamics (complexity science) have been developed that are discussed elsewhere (<a href=\"http://www.physionet.org/&amp;token=jkzmXRCPZe1ddgkeuc2jNeLnM9/IGyZv7zpqa1Gdz/sCZjtIXBrRLHDwn5zd7jBm&amp;TOPIC_ID=993\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.physionet.org</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>It should be noted, however, that because the term &quot;RR interval&quot; is often used, closer scrutiny is needed to determine if results of a particular study are in fact based on NNs only. This is increasingly true as more devices become commercially available that purport to measure HRV but derive this measurement from an indirect measurement of the pulse. In general, only time and frequency domain HRV measures are available in clinical practice, but heart rate turbulence is available on some commercial systems. Furthermore, most clinical HRV measures are only interpretable for autonomic assessment purposes if the patient is predominantly in normal sinus rhythm<em> </em><strong>and</strong> if the detection of the R-wave peaks and beat morphology is accurate, which can be problematic in a Holter recording ordered for clinical purposes and scanned by a technician who can only allocate limited effort before generating a Holter report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/15,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012840515\"><span class=\"h2\">HRV measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most Holter scanner manufacturers provide an HRV analysis feature; however, such analysis may not be included in the clinical report unless specifically requested by the ordering clinician. In addition, some manufacturers might use different names for some HRV variables.</p><p>For more information on HRV measurement, open source software for HRV analysis and open access databases are freely available at the website of the <span class=\"nowrap\">NIH/NCRR</span> Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals (<a href=\"http://www.physionet.org/&amp;token=jkzmXRCPZe1ddgkeuc2jNeLnM9/IGyZv7zpqa1Gdz/sCZjtIXBrRLHDwn5zd7jBm&amp;TOPIC_ID=993\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.physionet.org</a>), along with tutorial material.

The European Society of Cardiology, along with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Association, published a position statement in 2015 that provides a compact summary of HRV techniques and applications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Those who use HRV measures should be aware that short-term variability of NN intervals does not necessarily reflect intact vagal modulation of the sinoatrial node. Indeed, anomalous (nonrespiratory) sinus rhythm may confound measures of high frequency fluctuations in HRV, generally interpreted as due to healthy cardiac vagal modulation. Erratic sinus rhythm, described above, especially in older individuals and those with organic heart disease, may be a form of short-term HRV that is a marker of adverse cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. An alternative concept, <strong>heart rate fragmentation</strong>, and a set of metrics to quantify potentially nonvagal sources of short-term HRV have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The utility of this quantitative approach remains to be demonstrated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012840539\"><span class=\"h3\">Time domain HRV</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Average NN in milliseconds <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> heart rate in beats per minute) &ndash; Not a measure of variability per se, but average heart rate is an important marker for cardiac autonomic function that is available from any commercial Holter software.

Abnormal HRT has also been shown to be a risk marker in older adults without cardiac disease, although cut points for TS and elevated risk appear to be higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p>Although HRT measures, which generally require 24-hour Holter monitoring or at least five VPBs for calculation, are not available on most commercial Holter systems, abnormal heart rate turbulence may help identify autonomic dysfunction and increased risk of cardiovascular events among both cardiac patients and in low-risk population-dwelling older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/44,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46-48</a>]. As an example, in a prospective cohort study of 1455 acute myocardial infarction survivors who had HRT measured and were followed for an average of 22 months, patients with abnormal TO and TS were at significantly greater risk of death (hazard ratio 5.9, 95% CI 2.9-12.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Although abnormal HRT has been strongly associated with risk of sudden death, a more complete review of research findings for HRT by Cygankiewicz published in 2013 concluded that &quot;It seems that in order to enhance its predictive value HRT should be evaluated in combination with other markers&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The results of SCD-HeFT, in which abnormal TS was found to be one of several Holter-based risk factors for sudden cardiac death among patients with CHF, support this conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012840650\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic interpretation of HRV measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When HRV is measured over a five-minute period, SDNN, VLF, LF, and HF power, the <span class=\"nowrap\">LF/HF</span> ratio, normalized LF power, rMSSD, and pNN50 values can be generated. SDNN in this case would be the total HRV in five minutes only and is not related to circadian rhythm or to any paper likely cited in the manuscript that links decreased SDNN to adverse outcomes. HRV measures from five-minute or other short-term recordings, in some cases as short as one minute, have similar physiologic meanings to those from 24-hour recordings, which can be seen as the average of multiple short recordings, but they reflect only a very limited snapshot of autonomic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Heart rate should be the first number to be evaluated to give the rest of the values some context. As noted, the same names are often used for variables derived both short-term (typically five-minute) and longer term (usually 24-hour) recordings, so it is important to remember the origin of the data. Thus, it is obvious that a mean heart rate of 80 bpm over 24 hours would not be the same as a mean heart rate of 80 bpm while sitting in the office.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SDNN &ndash; SDNN captures total HRV, and low values on a 24-hour recording reflect a lack of circadian rhythm, a concerning sign. Higher values usually, though not necessarily, mean all is well, although a patient in atrial fibrillation might have very high values of SDNN, as would a patient whose heart rate increased throughout the recording rather than following a circadian rhythm. However, among cardiac patients, SDNN &gt;100 ms has been associated with a markedly lower risk of mortality. For example in the UK-heart study, among patients with CHF, annual mortality was 5.5 percent for SDNN &gt;100 ms versus 51.4 percent in patients with SDNN &lt;50 ms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SDANN &ndash; SDANN<em> </em>is only meaningful in a longer recording and also captures circadian rhythm in a 24-hour recording [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The same is true of<em> </em>ULF power, which measures nearly the same thing. SDNN and SDANN measured over 24 hours are usually of a similar magnitude because of the predominant contribution of circadian rhythm to total HRV. Thus, SDNN and the smoothed-out SD of five minutes averaged NN version, SDANN, should be within approximately 20 or 30 ms of each other, with SDANN usually lower, and a wider discrepancy could raise questions about the underlying rhythm or the quality of scanning. Since 24-hour SDNN<em>, </em>SDANN<em>, </em>TP, and ULF are all primarily influenced by the magnitude of the circadian rhythm, they tend to provide very similar information to the clinician, but SDNN is the best known and the most intuitively obvious.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VLF power &ndash; The physiologic interpretation of VLF power has not been well-studied. In healthy adults, VLF appears to reflect parasympathetic activity since it is abolished by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> administration and unaffected by beta-blockade. It also appears to reflect the activity of the renin-angiotensin system since it is reduced by ACE inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. At the same time, decreased VLF power has been strongly related to adverse outcomes. As is the case for most HRV measures, context is important. Numbers alone do not carry enough information. Thus, because it captures oscillations in the range of every 25 seconds to every five minutes, VLF power is also increased by abnormalities such as sleep disordered breathing events (although it could be argued that the ability to mount a strong autonomic response to them is a better clinical sign than being unable to mount such a response).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LF power &ndash; LF power reflects the combined modulation of efferent parasympathetic (vagal) and efferent sympathetic nervous system activity and is modulated by baroreflex activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HF power &ndash; HF power, under normal conditions, reflects modulation of efferent parasympathetic (vagal) activity by ventilation (respiratory sinus arrhythmia), but only in the presence of true sinus rhythm. When the power spectrum is plotted with the subject supine, HF power has a clearly visible peak, the center frequency of which reflects the predominant respiratory frequency. In the presence of very low respiratory rates (ie, below 10 per minute), respiration can actually modulate LF power, and the amount of HRV can increase dramatically because respiration is affecting both sympathetic and parasympathetic control of heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. Also, very rapid respiration, like that seen among CHF patients, sharply decreases HF power amplitude, paradoxically reflecting loss of vagal function because there is not enough time for the full effect of increased parasympathetic activity during the exhalation phase to slow the heart rate even among healthy people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. However, across the usual range of breathing frequencies, changes in respiratory rate appear to have little effect on the amplitude of the HF peak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">LF/HF</span> ratio &ndash; The <span class=\"nowrap\">LF/HF</span> ratio is often claimed to characterize &quot;sympathovagal balance&quot; or &quot;relative sympathetic activity&quot; because the LF band reflects modulation by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system and the HF band reflects parasympathetic activity. Although there are situations where this concept might usefully be applied, far too many situations exist where it cannot (eg, exercise, heart failure, the cold pressor test, etc), and claims about the meaning of this ratio should be interpreted with great caution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p>Several caveats apply to the interpretation of HRV measures. The position of the patient during a five-minute recording will dramatically affect HRV since parasympathetic activity is markedly increased for most people when they are supine. The limitations of this five-minute resting assessment must also be appreciated. Just as a resting ECG can yield information about clear ECG abnormalities, it provides no information about abnormalities or adaptations when the patient is active. A similar limitation applies to supine five-minute HRV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If it is markedly depressed, then certainly there is some autonomic abnormality present, but the effect of activity on HRV or whether circadian rhythm is abnormal, etc, will be much more informative than a resting snapshot. </p><p>Two other metrics defined in the table, rMSSD and pNN measures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79145\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79145 \">table 1</a>),<em> </em>are also usually reported from both five-minute and longer recordings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/33,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,42</a>]. Both characterize heart rate changes on a beat-to-beat basis and, since beat-to-beat changes in heart rate as opposed to longer term trends are mediated by changes in parasympathetic activity, the magnitude of either of these measures is taken as a surrogate of parasympathetic modulation of heart rate or, in the context of polyvagal theory, the activity of the myelinated vagus. For this reason, these measures should correlate strongly with each other and with HF power, which also measures parasympathetic activity as expressed by changes in the respiratory frequency band. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H322498\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal values for HRV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the complicating factors in using HRV clinically, aside from the technical issues discussed above, is that unlike, for example, a blood pressure measurement, there is a considerable range of normal values even in people of the same age and gender, and considerable ranges of normal change with age. A review of existing studies of normal values for short-term HRV found huge discrepancies in values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. More is known about 24-hour HRV measures, which have been collected in a large number of clinical populations and in some nonclinical ones as well. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study compared HRV in healthy middle-aged adults, recent post-MI patients (from the 1980s), and patients who were one-year post-MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. SDNN was highest in the healthy adults, intermediate in the one-year post-MI group, and lowest in the recent MI group, but there were no differences between groups in time domain measures of beat-to-beat HRV (rMSSD and pNN50). Importantly, the study reported that at the upper end of the distribution for the three groups, HRV <strong>did not</strong> separate healthy subjects from patients with either recent MI or one year post-MI. Thus, clinically, it is possible to find normal circadian HRV in a cardiac patient. Conversely, consistent with the idea that very low HRV reflects a significant abnormality, only 2 of 274 normal adults had values for ULF power previously reported to identify CHD patients at high risk of death, and only three had values for LF power below the cutpoint for increased risk of mortality in CHD patients, thus supporting the possibility that finding a presumably healthy adult with very low 24-hour HRV would be clinically meaningful but also underscoring the fact the &quot;normal&quot; HRV values may be found in patients with known CVD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 1998 study of HRV in 260 healthy adults found that HRV was both age and gender-dependent, with 95 percent confidence intervals reported for each decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Unfortunately, these limits are so broad as to be unusable clinically. For example, among adults in their 60's, normal limits for SDNN were defined as between 68 and 186 ms, and normal limits for 24-hour averaged heart rate were 52 to 99 bpm. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Cardiovascular Health Study examined changes in 24-hour-based frequency domain HRV over five years in 585 adults &gt;65 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. HRV declined more in the group that was aged 65 to 69 at baseline, less in the group that was 70 to 74, and almost not at all in the group that was &ge;75 years old. Although most HRV was slightly but significantly lower in the group with prevalent cardiovascular disease, there was no difference in the magnitude of the age-related change in HRV among those with or without CVD. However, heart rate, ratio-based and nonlinear HRV values continued to decline with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H322504\"><span class=\"h2\">Reproducibility of HRV measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The utility of HRV measures for prediction of outcome or detection of changes in clinical status depends on their stability over time. HRV is influenced significantly by age, race, sex, physical fitness, clinical comorbidities and drug treatment, but most 24-hour HRV appears to be stable when measured on a day-to-day basis and over periods of days to weeks when there are no major intervening events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>]. Less is known about serial changes in HRV in the same individuals over longer periods of time, but as previously mentioned, these changes might be age- and measure-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H322510\"><span class=\"h3\">Reproducibility in patients with cardiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reproducibility of HR variability measurements in patients with cardiac disease has been found to be comparable to the high stability observed in normal subjects. The stability of measures of HRV makes it possible to distinguish real changes due to progression or regression of cardiac disease or drug effects from apparent changes due to random variation. Unfortunately, criteria for real and significant changes in HRV have not been established. However, if a patient goes from apparently normal HRV (eg, SDNN &gt;120 ms) to markedly decreased HRV (eg SDNN &lt;70 ms) on serial recordings, this would be a matter of concern. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ventricular arrhythmias &ndash; In a study that evaluated the day-to-day stability of HRV in two groups of arrhythmia patients (a random sample of 40 patients in the ESVEM study who had sustained ventricular arrhythmias, and a random sample of 40 patients in the placebo group of CAPS who had nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias), there were no significant differences in measures of HRV between the two 24-hour recording sessions in either group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with stable angina &ndash; In a study of 261 patients with chronic stable angina followed for three years, most HRV measures remained largely unchanged over time, although pNN50 and <span class=\"nowrap\">LF/HF</span> were less stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

While HRV has been investigated and shows potential for risk stratification in a variety of clinical conditions, and HRV can be derived from a Holter recording ordered for other clinical indications, there remains no clear indication for the test in the routine management of most patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23881512\"><span class=\"h2\">Prediction of mortality in the early post-MI period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of HRV on prognosis post-MI, initially reported in the era prior to treatment with thrombolysis, has also been validated in patients with an MI treated with thrombolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. Patients with reduced indices of HRV measured early following an MI (within 14 days) have a three- to fourfold greater risk of death within three years following an MI. However, the sensitivity of measures like SDNN &lt;50 ms as predictors of mortality, originally estimated to be approximately 30 percent, has declined simply because improvements in post-MI treatment have resulted in markedly fewer patients having SDNN at those levels.</p><p>In a later study of 412 post-MI patients treated in the era of percutaneous revascularization and followed for 4.3 years, SDNN &lt;50 ms was seen in only 7 percent of patients, and only 31 patients died in the entire cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Even though an SDNN measurement of &lt;50 ms was associated with a doubling of risk of mortality compared with SDNN &gt;50 ms in the earlier landmark study, in the current study, SDNN &lt;50 ms was only found in 3 of the 31 who died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/72,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,75</a>]. </p><p>Another open question in this era of lower post-MI mortality is that of the optimal recording time after the event.

Among the 68 placebo-treated patients entered into the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS) who had 24-hour ECG recordings at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after MI, there was a substantial increase in all measures of HRV between three weeks and three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

This lack of correlation and the fact that measures of HRV are independent predictors of patients at high risk after myocardial infarction suggest the potential utility of combining abnormal HRV with other risk stratifiers to improve risk prediction, although doing so clearly limits the proportion of patients to whom this applies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/63,73,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,73,99</a>]. </p><p>As an example, among 1284 patients with a recent MI (within 28 days) followed for an average of 21 months in the ATRAMI study in whom baroreflex sensitivity and SDNN were used for risk stratification, patients with abnormal values for both had a 17 percent risk of mortality, whereas patients with normal values for both had a 2 percent risk (of note, mortality for the entire cohort was only 3.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The small number of patients with reduced HRV and LVEF less than 35 percent had nearly a sevenfold increase in mortality compared with patients with preserved HRV and LVEF of 35 percent or greater. (RR 6.7, 95% CI 3.1-14.6).</p><p>In addition, many other conditions are associated with autonomic abnormalities, including alcoholism, chronic kidney disease, severe hypertension, chemotherapy and other chemotoxins, sleep apnea, etc. So clinically, if the question is whether the patient has significant autonomic neuropathy, absent or very diminished HRV may provide useful adjunctive information. Turning this question around, the ability of serial HRV measures to identify patients who are having an adverse response to an intervention (eg, cardiotoxic chemotherapy) before they manifest clear deficits in cardiac function as reflected, for example, in reduced LVEF, is currently being investigated. As a final example, in infants, quantification of relative bradycardia and decreased heart rate variability may provide early warning of infection-related conditions in very low birth weight infants. In preterm babies, the myelinated vagus has not yet become active, and RSA is minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184760395\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines for the routine use of ambulatory monitoring to determine heart rate variability (HRV), based on the original Task Force recommendations from 1996, were also published in 1999 by a task force of the American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. While HRV has been used for risk stratification for all-cause, cardiac, and arrhythmic death post-myocardial infarction (MI), the precise role for HRV testing in clinical practice remains undefined and perhaps is a bit of a moving target due to changes in therapeutic approaches and also because understanding the message of HRV requires a real understanding of the context and often appraisal of the actual heart rate patterns and graphical plots derived from them. Some authors promote HRV for risk stratification, but others have been less enthusiastic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/33,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,102</a>].</p><p>With this in mind, we do <strong>not</strong> currently recommend the routine use of HRV testing outside of the clinical trial setting. We also believe that to further the field, existing and prospective datasets need to be analyzed with the goal of developing understandable algorithms that capture the rich and full clinical picture obtainable from these recording.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484483\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three major noninvasive or minimally invasive assessment approaches to evaluating the autonomic nervous system which provide complementary information about autonomic as well as non-autonomic regulatory mechanisms in health and disease: heart rate variability (HRV), baroreflex sensitivity, and bedside autonomic function tests. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The autonomic nervous system, including the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, has an important role in the triggering or sustaining of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"#H2012840208\" class=\"local\">'Triggering of cardiac arrhythmias and the autonomic nervous system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HRV (derived from intervals between normal sinus beats NN intervals) can be measured by many methods, which can be categorized as time domain measures, frequency domain measures, <span class=\"nowrap\">nonlinear/complexity-based</span> measures, and heart rate turbulence. (See <a href=\"#H2012840347\" class=\"local\">'HRV methodology, definitions, and normal values'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HRV appears to be highly consistent over 24 hours, despite marked differences among the five-minute intervals during a day. The same stability in HRV appears to be true for patients with ventricular arrhythmias, angina, and heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H322504\" class=\"local\">'Reproducibility of HRV measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HRV has been shown to be significantly decreased, compared with normal values, among post-myocardial infarction patients, although there is considerable inter-individual difference in this. This decreased HRV is a likely marker for autonomic dysregulation and likely reflects both decreased parasympathetic and increased sympathetic activity. Reduced HRV has also been associated with worse outcomes in patients with stable coronary heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Also, however, without accurate ECG analysis and an understanding of what HRV represents, HRV, especially short-term measures, can appear to be higher in the presence of either uneven beat detection or an erratic (fragmented) sinus rhythm. (See <a href=\"#H2012840808\" class=\"local\">'Clinical uses of HRV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do <strong>not</strong> recommend the routine use of HRV testing based on clinical Holter scanning at the moment, but we hope that a refinement of the conceptual framework and algorithms by which HRV is interpreted and measured can be implemented, such that HRV will have translational value in clinical settings. (See <a href=\"#H184760395\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lown B, Verrier RL.
