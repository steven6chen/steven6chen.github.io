Symptoms in AIP are due to effects on the visceral, peripheral, autonomic, and central nervous systems. They usually occur as intermittent attacks that are sometimes life-threatening due to neurologic complications (eg, seizures, paralysis).</p><p>The management of patients with attacks of AIP can be challenging because the disease manifestations are diverse and potentially life-threatening. Timely intervention can resolve and prevent attacks, and close long-term monitoring for complications is needed. Further, it is important not only to treat the porphyria, but also to address any other condition (eg, infection, medication exposure) that may have triggered the acute attack.</p><p>The management of AIP is reviewed here, including treatment of acute attacks, prevention, and long-term monitoring for complications. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of AIP and a general overview of the porphyrias are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyrias-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyrias: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3098735\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTING BEFORE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Demonstration of an elevation of urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) remains central to the diagnosis of acute porphyria. This finding is specific for the three most common acute porphyrias. Substantial PBG elevation (which occurs only in AIP, hereditary coproporphyria [HCP], and variegate porphyria [VP]) should be established, or have been established in the past, before treatment is started, particularly with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>. However, therapy for an acute attack does not require differentiation among these types of porphyria. The diagnosis of an attack in a patient with known acute porphyria is primarily clinical.</p><p>For patients who require further diagnostic testing to determine the type of porphyria, samples should be obtained prior to initiating therapy if possible, but determination of the specific type of porphyria should not delay therapy. A prior diagnosis of AIP or other acute porphyria cannot be assumed to be correct. Therefore, the evidence for the prior diagnosis should be available for review. If this is not available, a spot urine should be obtained and tested for PBG as soon as possible. Once it is known that an acute porphyria is indeed present, individual attacks are diagnosed and treated based on clinical findings (eg, typical symptoms), although confirmation of PBG elevation with each attack is recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3573911\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirm acute porphyria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of an acute attack of AIP requires confirmation that the patient has an acute porphyria, based on the finding of an elevated urinary PBG currently or in the past (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61709\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709 \">algorithm 1</a>). Patients with renal impairment may have measurement of plasma PBG instead, although results are not as rapidly available. Substantial elevation of urinary or plasma PBG during an acute attack is sensitive for AIP, HCP, and VP, and is not found in any other medical condition. PBG may be less elevated during attacks of HCP and VP, so screening should also include measurement of urinary porphyrins, which are expected to be markedly elevated in AIP, HCP, and VP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-coproporphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary coproporphyria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variegate-porphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variegate porphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the fourth acute porphyria, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase porphyria (ADP), PBG is normal or minimally elevated, and cases of this very rare type may be identified by measuring urinary porphyrins and delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), followed by further testing for confirmation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ala-dehydratase-porphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ALA dehydratase porphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Distinction among AIP, HCP, VP, and ADP by biochemical testing can take place simultaneously with treatment. However, samples for testing should be obtained before administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> because treatment can decrease levels of PBG and porphyrins. Molecular testing can also differentiate these acute porphyrias, if a known disease-causing mutation is identified. Importantly, treatment should not be delayed while awaiting results of this additional diagnostic testing. Further details of the diagnostic evaluation are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyrias-an-overview#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyrias: An overview&quot;, section on 'Laboratory diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27078974\"><span class=\"h2\">Establish presence of an acute attack</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient known to have an acute porphyria, based on prior diagnostic testing available for review, the presence of an acute attack is largely established clinically. A discussion of clinical manifestations of AIP is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H10092231\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Acute attacks'</a>.)</p><p>Recurrent attacks are generally similar in quality for each patient, although the severity may vary, and it is useful to document the degree of elevation of PBG with each attack. In women, the relationship of the attack to the menstrual cycle or to administration of progestins should be noted.</p><p>The following considerations are important in interpreting elevations of PBG in patients with symptoms suggesting an acute attack of porphyria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levels of PBG (and porphyrins and ALA) are often high in the absence of symptoms, especially in those who have had prior attacks. Therefore, substantial elevations in their levels are diagnostic of an acute porphyria, but not of an acute attack. The diagnosis of acute attack is based on the clinical presentation and exclusion of other possible causes of the presenting symptoms and signs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levels of PBG, ALA, and porphyrins increase above baseline during an acute AIP attack, but the levels and degree of elevation between attacks may fluctuate considerably, and &quot;baseline levels&quot; (ie, those present when the patient is asymptomatic) are often difficult to establish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is little published experience to support a requirement to document increases in these levels above an established baseline before treatment of an acute attack. However, it is useful to establish and follow baseline levels of PBG in the absence of symptoms and characterize the degree of increase that occurs with recurrent attacks in individual patients.</p><p/><p>Although PBG may not be a reliable indicator of the presence or absence of an attack, we measure PBG during attacks in order to correlate these elevations with clinical severity and for long term management of patients with recurring attacks. In contrast, the additional laboratory testing needed initially to differentiate among AIP, HCP, and VP, such as urine, plasma, and fecal porphyrins, is not necessary during attacks of AIP (unlike HCP and VP, in which this testing may be useful).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3098728\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPY FOR AN ACUTE ATTACK</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3574828\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of therapy for AIP (or other acute porphyria) is to abate the attack as rapidly as possible, and to provide appropriate supportive and symptomatic care until the acute attack resolves. Hospitalization is usually required for acute attacks because it facilitates treatment of severe symptoms; monitoring of respiration, electrolytes, and nutritional status; and the administration of glucose and intravenous administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hemin</a> or carbohydrate (glucose) loading are used to abate acute attacks. They are considered specific therapies that down-regulate hepatic ALAS1, the rate-limiting enzyme for heme biosynthesis in the liver. Hemin has a more potent effect and is used for severe attacks, and glucose loading is used only for mild attacks (eg, those that do not require hospitalization, opioid analgesia, or other intravenous medication; and are not accompanied by nausea and vomiting, motor neuropathy, paresis, seizures, agitation, delirium, psychosis, ileus that prevents oral intake, or hyponatremia). Glucose loading is also used if hemin is not immediately available. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous hemin'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10086663\" class=\"local\">'Carbohydrate loading'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe neurological manifestations, including paralysis and seizures, are potentially life-threatening and must be addressed immediately.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bedside spirometry should be available in all severe attacks to detect early respiratory impairment, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> should be continued until neurologic function recovers. (See <a href=\"#H189752634\" class=\"local\">'Paresis and paralysis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for evaluation of seizures and other central nervous system (CNS) symptoms may reveal findings consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). (See <a href=\"#H7384500\" class=\"local\">'Seizures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional treatment often includes opioid analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics, sedatives for sleep, antihypertensives, and electrolytes for correction of metabolic abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H945766\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of other symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exacerbating factors that may be contributing to the attack should be addressed, including elimination of potentially exacerbating medications, carbohydrate and caloric repletion, and treatment of concomitant infections. In women, the relationship of the attack to the menstrual cycle or to administration of progestins should be noted. Cyclic attacks typically occur premenstrually, during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are elevated. Measuring serum progesterone may help to identify such attacks. Keeping a menstrual and attack calendar can help to identify future attacks as premenstrual. (See <a href=\"#H7384748\" class=\"local\">'Elimination of exacerbating factors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189752634\"><span class=\"h2\">Paresis and paralysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weakness caused by motor neuron dysfunction is common, especially during severe and prolonged attacks; neuromuscular respiratory failure may also occur. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary in some cases. Various options are available for ventilatory support; these are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bedside spirometry should be available to detect early respiratory impairment. A falling vital capacity should prompt close monitoring of pO2 and pCO2 (typically in an intensive care unit) to determine the need for ventilatory support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hemin</a> treatment is indicated in any patient with porphyric motor neuropathy and can lead to rapid improvement if started soon after the symptoms appear. Patients with advanced motor neuropathy in whom the initial diagnosis of porphyria and treatment were delayed will recover more slowly and at an unpredictable rate. There are no established guidelines for hemin treatment in such patients, but hemin can be continued at least until neurologic improvement is evident and other acute symptoms of the attack have cleared. Patients have been treated for weeks to months, although experience is extremely limited.</p><p>To promote further neurologic improvement, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> may be continued daily and then tapered to less frequent dosing to maintain a normal or modestly elevated level of urine or plasma porphobilinogen (PBG), as determined by serial measurements. Neurologic recovery can continue for one to two years or longer. Some patients are left with some motor weakness, such as foot drop or hand weakness. Close follow-up is important to avoid or promptly treat recurrent attacks because these are detrimental to recovery from a previous severe attack.</p><p>There are few additional options for treatment of advanced motor neuropathy that does not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>. Quadriplegic patients needing respiratory support are poor candidates for liver transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7384500\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures can be caused by direct central neurologic dysfunction or by hyponatremia, often resulting from hypothalamic involvement and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures are treated as acute, provoked events (eg, with treatment of the underlying cause, supportive care, and establishment of intravenous access); a benzodiazepine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> is used if a seizure lasts longer than two minutes.

Almost all anticonvulsant drugs have at least some potential for exacerbating acute porphyrias. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gabapentin</a> (eg, Neurontin, Gralise) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> (Keppra) are safe, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> may be less harmful than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, barbiturates, or valproic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H945766\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of other symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AIP symptoms are usually severe during an attack, and pain often requires opioid analgesics. Symptomatic treatment should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain is due to direct neuropathic effects of the acute attack. Pain is usually severe and opioid agents are required. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are generally inadequate, can cause adverse effects on the GI tract and kidneys, and some may be contraindicated in acute porphyrias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting often accompany abdominal pain and may be caused by visceral neuropathy, ileus, or central nervous system effects of acute porphyria. Nausea and vomiting can interfere with dietary intake, which in turn can worsen the acute attack. Thus, these symptoms should be treated with antiemetics, along with intravenous fluids and carbohydrate supplementation for patients who are unable to maintain adequate oral hydration and caloric intake. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chlorpromazine</a>, other phenothiazines, or serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>, are safe to use in the acute porphyrias. Cardiac telemetry should be considered with administration of 5-HT3 antagonists or other drugs that can prolong the corrected QT interval (QTc), although an increased risk of these adverse effects have not been reported in acute porphyrias.

This therapy should be administered without delay once a diagnosis of an acute attack of porphyria is established (ie, we do not perform an initial trial of glucose loading prior to starting hemin). However, glucose loading should be used until hemin becomes available, if it is not immediately available on site. Although hemin is costly, prompt administration can usually lead to rapid resolution of an attack, usually within four to five days.

Lyophilized hematin (ie, heme hydroxide; Panhematin) is available in the United States; Normosang (a concentrated solution of heme arginate that is diluted with saline for intravenous administration) is available in Europe and South Africa. These are therapeutically equivalent for the repression of hepatic heme synthesis. A source of confusion comes from the fact that hemin is also the chemical term for heme liganded to chloride, which is very stable but not soluble at physiological pH.</p><p>Our recommendation differs from the product labeling for the lyophilized hematin preparation available in the United States (Panhematin), which recommends an initial trial of glucose loading prior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Product labeling recommends reconstitution of Panhematin with sterile water. However, it was discovered post-marketing that degradation products begin to form immediately upon reconstitution with sterile water, and these degradation products can bind to endothelial cells and clotting factors, causing infusion-site phlebitis and a transient anticoagulant effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/8,9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,11,12</a>].

It then enters and reconstitutes the regulatory &quot;free&quot; heme pool in hepatocytes (a hypothetical pool of heme not yet committed to form hemoproteins or to degradation by heme oxygenase) and represses synthesis of the first enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>].

Infusion site phlebitis from Panhematin can be diminished by reconstitution with albumin rather than sterile water as described earlier in this discussion of hemin. Fever, aches, malaise, hemolysis, anaphylaxis, and circulatory collapse have been reported; excessive dosing of hemin caused reversible renal damage (acute tubular necrosis) in one case and acute liver failure, requiring liver transplantation in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Hemin therapy is expensive, but its use can shorten hospitalization and reduce medical costs. Intravenous heme therapy is best given into a large-bore central vein with high blood flow by way of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) or other central venous catheter to reduce the risk of phlebitis.</p><p>Iron overload can develop after multiple <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> treatments. We monitor serum ferritin in patients who receive multiple hemin infusions (eg, at baseline and after 10 to 15 doses of hemin). Serum ferritin is also followed to detect iron deficiency, which is common in women with or without AIP, and in patients with repeated hospitalizations and frequent blood sampling.

However, most patients have nausea, vomiting, and poor gut motility and are unable to take in sizable oral doses of glucose or other carbohydrates. Thus, in most cases, intravenous glucose needs to be given. A typical regimen is 300 to 400 grams per 24 hours, usually administered as a 10 percent solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Of note, however, the effects of several liters of free water administered daily with intravenous glucose may increase the risk of hyponatremia. A parenteral nutrition (hyperalimentation) regimen may be used for malnourished patients or those with prolonged limitation of oral intake due to continuing symptoms. Hyperglycemia may also occur in some patients; glucose levels should be monitored and insulin may be given with glucose to prevent marked hyperglycemia in patients with glucose intolerance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7384748\"><span class=\"h2\">Elimination of exacerbating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triggering conditions for AIP attacks, such as acute infections, must be treated promptly, and medications responsible for triggering acute attacks should be discontinued.

Fever and leukocytosis are likely to be caused by infection or inflammation (eg, appendicitis, pancreatitis, diverticulitis) rather than AIP. When present, acute infections should be treated simultaneously with specific AIP treatment (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>).

As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a> is a known inhibitor of hepatic cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and prevents hepatic porphyria in normal rodents caused by chemicals (eg, allylisopropylacetamide [AIA], which causes porphyria only after metabolic activation by hepatic CYPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Such chemicals are rarely if ever implicated in attacks of human AIP. Cimetidine has not been studied in rodents with targeted PBGD mutations. Uncontrolled observations in small numbers of patients were suggested to show that intravenous cimetidine leads to resolution of attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]; however, these reports do not exclude spontaneous improvement, which can occur without treatment with hemin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The use of cimetidine in AIP lacks both rationale and clinical evidence, and it should not be used as a less-expensive substitute for hemin. Moreover, an intravenous preparation of cimetidine is no longer available in the United States. Intravenous glucose should be used if hemin is not immediately available.</p><p>Hemodialysis has also been suggested for treating acute attacks if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> is not immediately available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Residual paresis may be present after recovery from severe attacks. Patients may have chronic pain without paresis.</p><p>In contrast to acute attacks, subacute or chronic symptoms are unlikely to respond to administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>, which is rapidly metabolized to biliverdin and bilirubin by hepatic heme oxygenase and biliverdin reductase, and therefore represses hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS1) for only a few days. The pathogenesis of chronic pain and other symptoms in AIP is poorly understood, but may represent longstanding and possibly permanent neuropathic effects of repeated attacks that were not promptly treated. A trial of hemin may be warranted in patients with subacute symptoms, but chronic pain and other symptoms are treated symptomatically, often with consultation with a pain management specialist. The possible use of liver transplantation should be evaluated before development of chronic complications such as extensive paresis, if possible.

If used, weight loss diets should provide gradual weight loss and should be used during periods of clinical stability.

Alternatively, small-volume phlebotomy to reduce serum ferritin levels to within the normal range have been used in patients with iron overload. As an example, in patients with high ferritin levels who are benefitting from weekly hemin infusions, a small-volume phlebotomy may be done before each weekly hemin infusion.

Disease penetrance in AIP is low; most individuals with a <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</em></span> mutation are clinically asymptomatic (referred to as latent disease), but they are at risk for porphyria attacks and may benefit from avoiding factors that could trigger a porphyria attack such as exacerbating medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57422 \">table 1</a>), fasting, smoking, or alcohol. If they do develop symptoms of AIP, the cause is likely to be recognized sooner because they are already known to have AIP rather than simply a family history of the disease. Thus, it is important to identify individuals in a family with the mutation, if possible, and counsel them to avoid exacerbating factors and inform their clinicians if symptoms develop.

Longitudinal natural history studies to better define prognosis are now underway in the United States by the <a href=\"http://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/porphyrias/index.htm&amp;token=H1XiyCEq6nWHdSL7Q6C8vw9kdlccil5zUN8kWUv8rgKsJJ5LxwcBySEieCXe9jcKAgNzPI2SJhBbfJUpgIIZiA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7142\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Porphyrias Consortium</a> and by the <a href=\"http://www.porphyria-europe.com/&amp;token=DXiNnVb2ZFrySDKpmM7piK0vep3FDAp2O059vsC/rJYMZc11DOZNo4Fc7u3H5RAB&amp;TOPIC_ID=7142\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">European Porphyria Network (EPNET)</a>.</p><p>Mortality is increased in patients with severe clinical manifestations. This was demonstrated in a retrospective review of 136 patients with AIP severe enough to require hospitalization, which found a standardized mortality ratio of 3.2 (95% CI 2.4-4.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. During almost 50 years of observation, approximately one-third of the patients died. Common causes of death included complications of the initial or a subsequent acute attack (eg, complications of respiratory paralysis), which accounted for 20 and 38 percent of deaths, respectively. Suicide was also common (five patients). The standardized mortality ratio remained high after exclusion of the 10 patients who died during the initial acute attack (2.6, 95% CI 1.8-3.4). This study spanned the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> therapy, after which survival was better than before hemin but still less than the general population. Age at diagnosis and sex were not predictive of mortality, nor were levels of porphyrin precursor excretion.</p><p>However, patients can have a good prognosis, especially if their disease remains latent or when the diagnosis is made in a timely fashion, acute attacks are managed rapidly, and future attacks prevented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of an acute attack of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) requires confirmation that the patient has acute porphyria, based on the finding of elevated urinary porphobilinogen (PBG), but it does not require diagnosis of the specific type of porphyria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61709\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709 \">algorithm 1</a>). Distinction between AIP, hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), variegate porphyria (VP), and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase porphyria (ADP) can continue simultaneously with treatment, using samples collected before treatment is begun. In a patient known to have an acute porphyria based on prior testing, the presence of an acute attack is largely established clinically. (See <a href=\"#H3098735\" class=\"local\">'Testing before therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of therapy for an acute attack of AIP (or other acute porphyria) is to abate the attack as rapidly as possible, and to provide appropriate supportive and symptomatic care until the acute attack resolves. Hospitalization is usually required. (See <a href=\"#H3098728\" class=\"local\">'Therapy for an acute attack'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with AIP (or other acute porphyria) attacks that are severe enough to require hospitalization, opioid analgesia, or other intravenous medication, or are accompanied by nausea and vomiting, motor neuropathy, paresis, seizures, agitation, delirium, psychosis, ileus that prevents oral intake, or hyponatremia, we recommend intravenous administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> rather than carbohydrate loading (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). This recommendation is based on the high risk of life-threatening sequelae from a severe acute porphyria attack and the apparent efficacy and safety of hemin based on observational data; however, prospective randomized clinical trials are lacking. Hemin should be administered without delay once the presence of an acute attack of porphyria is established. A typical regimen is Panhematin, 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> reconstituted with 25 percent human albumin and administered intravenously as a single daily dose for four days. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous hemin'</a> above.) Carbohydrate loading should be used as a temporizing measure while awaiting the availability of intravenous hemin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We also suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> rather than carbohydrate loading for patients with AIP attacks characterized with mild pain not requiring opioid analgesics and without severe manifestations such as seizures, paralysis, or hyponatremia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, an initial trial of carbohydrate loading is sometimes effective. Typical regimens include oral glucose polymer solution, up to 300 grams daily; or 10 percent intravenous glucose, 300 to 400 grams per 24 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Paresis is potentially life-threatening, may lead to quadriparesis and respiratory paralysis, and must be addressed immediately (eg, with mechanical ventilation as needed). Bedside spirometry should be available to detect early respiratory impairment, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> should be continued until neurologic function recovers. (See <a href=\"#H189752634\" class=\"local\">'Paresis and paralysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seizures may be due to hyponatremia or porphyria itself, and are difficult to treat because most anticonvulsants can exacerbate acute porphyrias. Seizures may be treated with anticonvulsant drugs if rapid spontaneous resolution does not occur. Almost all anticonvulsant drugs have at least some potential for exacerbating acute porphyrias. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> are safe, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> may be less harmful than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, barbiturates, or valproic acid. (See <a href=\"#H7384500\" class=\"local\">'Seizures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other AIP symptoms can also be severe. Pain is the most prominent symptoms and almost always requires opioid analgesics. Nausea and vomiting, agitation, hallucinations, anxiety, insomnia, tachycardia, and hypertension also require therapy. (See <a href=\"#H945766\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of other symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute and chronic symptoms sometimes develop after repeated attacks and can be managed with symptomatic therapy and prevention of further acute attacks. A pain management specialist if often helpful for achieving adequate control of chronic pain. (See <a href=\"#H7384741\" class=\"local\">'Therapy for subacute or chronic symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with AIP have identifiable triggers for attacks; these should be avoided <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> minimized as much as possible. Patients should avoid smoking, alcohol, and harmful medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57422 \">table 1</a>). Lists of safe and unsafe drugs are available on websites of the American Porphyria Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.porphyriafoundation.com/&amp;token=DXiNnVb2ZFrySDKpmM7piEpVAnOmMg/hENsp80iGuZ5qTNHOLQI0S8f/nFKYbrsC&amp;TOPIC_ID=7142\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.porphyriafoundation.com</a>) and the European Porphyria Network (EPNET: <a href=\"http://www.porphyria-europe.com/&amp;token=DXiNnVb2ZFrySDKpmM7piK0vep3FDAp2O059vsC/rJYMZc11DOZNo4Fc7u3H5RAB&amp;TOPIC_ID=7142\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.porphyria-europe.com</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional strategies for preventing attacks include maintenance of a well-balanced diet somewhat high in carbohydrates; correction of iron deficiency as detected by monitoring serum ferritin; suppression of menstrual cycles for patients with luteal-phase symptoms; and prompt treatment of any intercurrent infections or other illnesses. (See <a href=\"#H1422388\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of attacks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with AIP are at risk for developing chronic renal failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and iron deficiency from menstrual blood loss (as in women without AIP) or iron overload from frequent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> therapy. Hypertension should be controlled and nephrotoxic drugs avoided; patients over age 50 should have hepatic imaging for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma; and serum ferritin levels should be monitored. It is reasonable to measure liver function tests, since transaminases are often persistently abnormal in patients with AIP and frequent symptoms. Reasonable indications for liver transplantation include frequent hospitalizations, unresponsiveness to hemin, and a poor quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H3574342\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for complications of disease and therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H434170808\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the familial mutation responsible for AIP has been identified in an index patient, family members should undergo DNA testing to identify asymptomatic gene carriers who are at risk of developing AIP. Detection of gene carriers can also reduce delays in diagnosis if symptoms develop in the future. Most individuals with AIP do not consider it a barrier to having children. (See <a href=\"#H10086880\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data are scare regarding the prognosis of individuals with AIP due to the rarity and low penetrance of the condition. Mortality is increased in patients with severe clinical manifestations; however, patients can have a good prognosis, especially when their disease remains latent or the diagnosis is made in a timely fashion and acute attacks are managed rapidly and prevented thereafter.
