Pets may lower blood pressure, reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and improve feelings of loneliness, while increasing opportunities for exercise, outdoor activities, and socialization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In a small, randomized, controlled study of 28 patients with chronic age-related disabilities living in a nursing home, patients were randomly assigned to animal interaction (&quot;pet therapy&quot;) compared with usual activities (control group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The &quot;pet therapy&quot; group patients had improved symptoms of depression and a significant decrease in blood pressure values as compared with the control patients.</p><p>Despite these benefits, pets present zoonotic risks, especially for immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The epidemiology of dog-related zoonoses will be reviewed here. The epidemiology of pet-related zoonoses other than dogs is presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoonoses-from-cats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zoonoses from cats&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoonoses-from-pets-other-than-dogs-and-cats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zoonoses from pets other than dogs and cats&quot;</a>). The clinical management of specific zoonotic diseases is discussed under the appropriate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A zoonosis is an animal disease that is transmissible to humans. Humans are usually an accidental host that acquire disease through close contact with an infected animal who may or may not be symptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Pet Association estimates that there are approximately 45 million dog owners in the United States, who own a total of about 63 million dogs (<a href=\"http://www.apapets.org/&amp;token=+2oqvu8iPSnBMQoxEVE56k1TdxMO2Sty8OhYbBN8l1I=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5529\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.apapets.org</a>). The most common route of infection related to dogs is through bites, especially in children. Dogs bite more than 4.7 million people a year; in 2001, an estimated 368,245 persons were treated in United States hospital emergency departments for nonfatal dog bite-related injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-dog-and-cat-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to dog and cat bites&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care providers should ask about pets when taking a medical history and formulating a differential diagnosis. Many of the risks posed by pet ownership can be reduced by good hygiene after handling pets, careful pet selection, and proper pet care. New pets can pose more of a health risk because health history and vaccination records may not be known. Adult pets are generally safer than younger animals, since they are less likely to be involved in playful activities that include scratching and biting. Children are at highest risk for infection because they are more likely to have close contact with pets.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dogs are responsible for transmission of an extensive array of bacterial and parasitic zoonotic pathogens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80280%7EID%2F54607%7EID%2F67427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80280 graphicRef54607 graphicRef67427 \">table 1A-C</a>). Many different routes of transmission can cause infections related to pets, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious saliva that contaminate bite wounds, skin abrasions, or mucous membranes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hand-to-mouth transfer of microorganisms, cysts, or oocysts (eggs) from feces of an infected animal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insect bites when these vectors are carried into the home by pets or when bites transmit disease from a pet, acting as a disease reservoir, to humans</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aerosol from body fluids (eg, respiratory secretions, placenta)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contamination of water or the environment with pathogen containing animal urine</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious saliva</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Saliva can transmit and contaminate bite wounds, skin abrasions, or mucous membranes. Dog bites are the most common type of animal bite with most bites occurring in children. Bacterial contamination occurs with all animal bites, however, only 5 percent of dog bites develop local infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Rabies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In developing countries, dogs account for 90 percent or more of rabies cases transmitted to humans. In contrast, in the United States, wild animals are the major animal reservoirs. While the likelihood of domestic animal (eg, dog and cat) rabies is small in the United States, it varies by region. In the continental United States, rabies among dogs is most often reported along the United States-Mexico border. However, sporadic cases do occur outside of this area, particularly in areas with enzootic wildlife rabies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rabies immune globulin and vaccine&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rabies is a fatal disease in dogs, which can have several phases including the prodromal, furious, and paralytic stages. Dogs are most often infected by the bite of another infected animal. Rabies is transmitted to humans by contaminated saliva through a bite, scratch, or lick of a rabid animal.</p><p>Human rabies is rare in the United States, with only 47 cases reported between 1990 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, rabies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute progressive encephalitis, regardless of a history of an animal bite. Because of the nonspecific early symptoms, other more common infectious and noninfectious disorders (eg, encephalitis caused by arboviruses or enterovirus and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome or vasculitis) should be ruled out (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79957\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79957 \">algorithm 1</a>).

The infection rate from penetrating dog bites ranges from 2 to 10 percent.</p><p><em>Pasteurella</em> spp can cause soft-tissue infections following animal bites or scratches; bites and scratches can also result in septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pasteurella-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pasteurella infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Capnocytophaga</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Capnocytophaga</em> was first isolated in 1976 from the blood and CSF of a patient who had received a dog bite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. <em>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</em> (formerly CDC group DF-2) is a fastidious, gram-negative rod that forms part of the normal oral flora of dogs and cats. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capnocytophaga\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Capnocytophaga&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both <em>C. canimorsus</em> and <em>C. cynodegmi</em> cause human infection, often following a dog or cat bite or scratch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. <em>C. canimorsus</em> can cause fulminant sepsis and meningitis, particularly in asplenic patients or alcoholics. The mortality rate for <em>C. canimorsus</em> septicemia is 30 to 36 percent but mortality due to meningitis is much lower (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and management of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p><em>C. cynodegmi</em> animal bite wound infections are a less severe infection that is usually restricted to skin and soft tissues, although a case report described the death of a splenectomized woman who received a dog bite and developed <em>C. cynodegmi</em> sepsis and meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Brucella</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Brucella canis</em> infection in dogs appears to have a worldwide distribution, but human infections with <em>B. canis</em> are either uncommon or uncommonly recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Instead, the <em>Brucella</em> spp that are frequently associated with human brucellosis are <em>B. melitensis</em>, <em>B. suis</em>, and <em>B. abortus</em>. Humans may become infected when they are exposed to body fluids from a <em>B. canis</em> infected dog. Most cases of human transmission from dogs are in farm settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>Human brucellosis is a well-documented cause of fever of unknown origin with varied and nonspecific symptoms.

In addition, numerous parasitic diseases can be transmitted from dogs to humans through feces, including toxocariasis, cutaneous larva migrans (<em>Ancylostoma caninum</em> and <em>A. braziliense</em>), echinococcosis, and dipylidiasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Salmonella</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1999 and 2000, four outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness due to multi-drug resistant <em>Salmonella enterica</em> serotype <em>Typhimurium</em> were reported in employees, clients, and animals from three veterinary clinics and one animal shelter; more than 45 persons and pets became ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p><em>Salmonella</em> can also be transmitted via contaminated pet food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] and through animal-derived pet treats, including pig ear treats, beef steak patty dog treats, and pet treats of seafood origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. To prevent such infection, individuals should wash their hands with soap and water after handling dry pet foods, especially before handling food for humans. In contrast, the manufacturing process for canned pet food should eliminate bacterial contamination.</p><p><em>Salmonella</em> spp infections transmitted to humans usually result in a mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis. However, severe invasive illness, such as septicemia or meningitis, can occur especially in infants and immunocompromised persons. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontyphoidal Salmonella: Gastrointestinal infection and carriage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Campylobacter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A surveillance study of possible animal reservoirs of <em>Campylobacter</em> spp in Barbados identified that 61 of 130 pet dogs (47 percent) had <em>Campylobacter</em> spp isolated from fecal specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Direct zoonotic transmission of <em>Campylobacter</em> from contact with dogs and puppies (one of which resulted in neonatal sepsis) has been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p><em>Campylobacter enteritis</em> presents after an incubation period of one to seven days as a syndrome most commonly characterized by prominent abdominal pain and profuse diarrhea that is often bloody.

The spectrum of clinical disease includes asymptomatic infection, self-limited acute giardiasis, and chronic infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Giardiasis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Transmission of infectious <em>Giardia</em> cysts to humans may occur via three routes: waterborne, foodborne, or fecal-oral transmission. The greatest risk of zoonotic transmission appears to be from pets, especially dogs and cats. A surveillance study of <em>G. intestinalis</em> isolates obtained from children with diarrhea and their dogs found that genotype A was associated with zoonotic transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. However, zoonotic transmission may be infrequent, since human disease peaks in the United States in August and September, whereas canine disease does not seem to have any significant or distinct seasonality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxocara canis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Toxocara canis</em> (dog roundworm) causes visceral larva migrans and ocular larva migrans in humans. These roundworms live in the small intestine of the dog in the adult stage, where eggs are passed in the feces. Up to 15 percent of healthy older dogs actively excrete <em>T. canis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In endemic areas, empiric treatment of dogs lowered the rate of <em>Toxocara</em> infection in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Human infections are caused by ingestion of eggs from contaminated hands, soil, or fomites and are usually asymptomatic to mild and accompanied by a persistent eosinophilia. The larvae penetrate the intestinal wall but are unable to complete their life cycle and produce eosinophilic granulomas in host tissues. Infection produces a syndrome in humans termed visceral larva migrans or toxocariasis. This disorder may be subclinical; it also may present primarily as an ocular form. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxocariasis-visceral-and-ocular-larva-migrans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxocariasis: Visceral and ocular larva migrans&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Systemic toxocariasis most often affects children aged one to four. Clinical manifestations include eosinophilia, rash, fever, cough, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary infiltrates, seizures, and behavior disorders. Ocular larva migrans often presents in older children with a unilateral reduction in vision or strabismus and often with retinal involvement but without the systemic symptoms or eosinophilia seen in visceral disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Ancylostoma caninum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hookworm <em>A. caninum</em> and <em>A. braziliense</em> are the etiologic agents of cutaneous larva migrans. The eggs are shed in the feces of infected dogs or cats. In the United States, the dog hookworm, <em>A. caninum</em>, is a commonly occurring parasite.</p><p>Humans (and pets) are infected when bare skin comes in contact with soil contaminated with the larvae. The second-stage larvae are able to penetrate the intact skin of humans and the footpads of dogs and cats. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A pruritic erythematous papule develops initially at the site of each larval entry. Two to three days later, and at times weeks later, severely pruritic, elevated, serpiginous, reddish-brown lesions appear as the larvae migrate at a rate of several millimeters per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60144\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60144 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Echinococcus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dogs and other carnivorous mammals are the definitive hosts for the tapeworm, <em>Echinococcus granulosus </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86230\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86230 \">figure 1</a>). The adult tapeworm inhabits the small intestine of the dog and can produce eggs that are expelled in the feces contaminating the environment. The eggs are infective to humans. Once ingested, they enter the portal circulation and spread to the liver and other tissues, where they are either destroyed or form hydatid cysts. The cysts slowly enlarge over years, due to the multiplying larvae inside. The most common sites of infection in humans are the liver, lung, bone, kidney, and brain.

Fleas usually serve as the intermediate hosts and contain cysticercoids. If a human (usually a child) ingests cysticercoids (larva), an adult tapeworm can develop in the intestine.</p><p>This infection is usually asymptomatic. However, abdominal pain, diarrhea, pruritus ani, and urticaria can develop. In addition, parents may notice the passage of proglottids (eg, body segments of the adult tapeworm, which have a complete set of reproductive organs) that resemble cucumber seeds in their children's stool.

Approximately 95 percent of cases of Lyme disease in the United State are reported from twelve states: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Michigan, and Wisconsin.</p><p>In highly endemic areas, dog owners should inspect their pets regularly for ticks, as tick collars have a variable efficacy. Owners should inspect their cats for ticks for two reasons. First, dogs can develop Lyme disease, which presents as sudden onset lameness with a swollen, warm, and tender joint. Second, dogs may carry ticks indoors, and if these ticks carry <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and attach to a human, they may then transmit Lyme disease to the pet's human family.

The principle vector of <em>E. chaffeensis</em> is thought to be the Lone Star tick (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71086\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71086 \">picture 8</a>) (<em>Amblyomma americanum</em>, whose primary host is deer). A. phagocytophilum, in contrast, may be transmitted by <em>Ixodes scapularis </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73802\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73802 \">picture 2</a>), the tick that is also the vector of Lyme disease and babesiosis (see below). Most cases of HME have occurred in the southeastern, south-central, and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. States with the highest incidence of HGA during 2001 to 2002 were Rhode Island, Minnesota, Connecticut, New York, and Maryland. HGA is also reported in Western Europe.</p><p><em>E. ewingii</em>, the agent of canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis can cause disease in humans.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) distinguished the <em>E. ewingii</em> organism from <em>E. chaffeensis</em>; morules were observed in granulocytes in two of the patients; and one patient's dogs displayed a similar serologic reaction as the patient, suggesting zoonotic transmission.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of HME and HGA are variable. Most patients are febrile with nonspecific symptoms including malaise, myalgia, headache, and chills.

Human disease is most commonly due to <em>Babesia microti</em> (United States) or <em>Babesia divergens</em> (Europe). The vector for babesiosis is the Ixodid tick, the same vector as Lyme disease and anaplasmosis. Babesiosis occurs predominantly on the Northeast coast of the United States.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of disease can range from asymptomatic infection to severe hemolytic anemia associated with jaundice, hemoglobinuria, renal failure, and death.

Humans are accidental hosts following contact with infected animals or vectors. In the United States, tularemia has been reported from 49 states, but the majority of cases occur in the south central states, mainly Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. Vector-borne disease, by ticks in the Rocky Mountain region and eastward and biting flies in California, Nevada, and Utah, are the most common way the disease is transmitted in the United States.

Dogs are susceptible to infection and may be a significant sentinel animal. Dogs become infected after being bitten by rodents' fleas and have a brief and self-limited illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. They can carry the infected fleas, which can spread disease to humans through a fleabite. Foci of plague are present on most continents other than Australia. In the United States, plague is endemic in all of the western states and has extended north and east over the years. Ninety percent of human cases in the United States have occurred in four states: Arizona, California, Colorado, and New Mexico.

Most dogs are asymptomatic, but some animals may have exercise intolerance, hemoptysis, or signs of right ventricular outflow obstruction. Dirofilariasis is particularly common in the Mediterranean region but has been reported from many different countries, including the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=miscellaneous-nematodes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Miscellaneous nematodes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The organism is transmitted to humans by Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, or Myzorhynchus mosquitoes, which ingest blood-containing microfilaria from affected dogs. Two clinical syndromes of dirofilariasis occur in humans: pulmonary and cutaneous infection. Cutaneous infection occurs when the larva die after inoculation into the subcutaneous tissue and cause an urticarial eruption. If a larva survives and reaches the heart, it dies and forms an embolus, which travels to the lungs resulting in focal pneumonitis followed by granuloma formation. The pulmonary emboli are identified as a &quot;coin lesion&quot; on radiograph and the diagnosis of dirofilariasis is made when the lesion, appearing to be a neoplasm, is removed surgically. There are no medications used to treat humans.

Humans and mammals, including the dog, are reservoirs for the disease. Female sand flies transmit the disease from an infected mammal to humans. In a serologic surveillance study in Iran, dog ownership and dog density in a village was a significant risk factor for seropositivity in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zoonoses-from-dogs/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].
