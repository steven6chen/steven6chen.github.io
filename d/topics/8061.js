In a population-based case control study in Denmark, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of receiving a diagnosis of HIV within five years after presentation with thrombocytopenia was 24.0 (10.5 to 54.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a similar study from Taiwan, individuals diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) during a twelve-year period were 6.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with HIV infection than age- and sex-matched controls (overall HIV incidence of 3.78 among 5472 patients with ITP compared with 0.58 among 21,887 controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The degree of thrombocytopenia at presentation varies.

As an example, in a retrospective case-control study of HIV-infected patients, thrombocytopenic patients (ie, platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL</span> for more than three months) were significantly more likely to have HCV co-infection (OR 6.1; 95% CI 1.6-23), cirrhosis (OR 24, 95% CI1.7-338) and detectable HIV viremia (OR 5.3; 95% CI 1.6-17.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In another international assessment of the prevalence of thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;125,000/microL)</span> among patients with previously untreated HIV, the frequency of reduced platelet counts correlated with geographic location and Hepatitis B co-infection. Prevalences of thrombocytopenia exceeding 5 percent were observed among patients from India, Brazil, the United States, and Malawi; in contrast, the baseline prevalence of thrombocytopenia was less than 5 percent among patients enrolled from Haiti, Peru, South Africa, and Thailand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>The underlying basis for most cases of thrombocytopenia in the setting of HIV is thought to be due to immune dysregulation resembling immune thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'HIV-associated thrombocytopenia'</a> below.)</p><p>The other major cause of thrombocytopenia is a reduced platelet count secondary to medications, infection, or thrombotic microangiopathy.

Clinically, this condition is similar to primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), except that splenomegaly is more commonly noted in patients with HIV. Platelet counts are often higher in HIV-infected patients, and mild thrombocytopenia occasionally resolves without therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

Bone marrow examination, as in primary ITP, reveals normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes in the face of reduced numbers of circulating platelets. This combination suggests the presence of ineffective platelet production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased peripheral destruction. Kinetic studies using radiolabeled autologous platelets from HIV-infected individuals have shown that both factors contribute: there is more than a 50 percent reduction in platelet survival and a 50 percent reduction in platelet production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In a comprehensive study comparing the kinetics of the megakaryocyte-platelet system in HIV-infected thrombocytopenic patients with normal controls, the following differences were found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced platelet survival (87 versus 232 hours)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced recovery of infused platelets (33 versus 65 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased megakaryocyte number [30 x 10<sup>6</sup> versus 11 x 10<sup>6</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/kg]</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced marrow megakaryocyte progenitors [3.3 versus 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU-Meg/1000</span> CD34(+) cells]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO) concentration (596 versus 95 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> and increased TPO receptor number (461 versus 207 <span class=\"nowrap\">receptors/platelet)</span></p><p/><p>These studies indicate a triad of shortening of platelet life span by two-thirds, a doubling of splenic platelet sequestration, and ineffective delivery of viable platelets, despite a threefold expansion in marrow megakaryocyte mass driven by TPO.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduced platelet survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral destruction of platelets in patients with HIV infection is probably due to the presence of antiplatelet antibodies in the serum and on the surface of platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/1,18-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18-24</a>]. Platelet-associated IgG crossreacts with the platelet glycoprotein complex <span class=\"nowrap\">(GP)IIb/IIIa</span> and the HIV envelope glycoproteins <span class=\"nowrap\">GP160/120</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In two studies, such antibodies were found in 70 and 73 percent of sera from HIV-infected patients with thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. IgM anti-idiotype antibodies directed against platelet anti-GPIIIa appear to directly regulate the degree of thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, anti-HIV antibodies that bind to normal control platelets were found in 50 percent of sera from patients with thrombocytopenia as compared with only 5 percent of sera from HIV-infected patients with normal platelet counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Electron microscopy of megakaryocytes from HIV-infected individuals with thrombocytopenia clearly demonstrates ultrastructural abnormalities not encountered in noninfected patients; blebbing of the surface membrane and vacuolization of peripheral cytoplasm are the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It is postulated that infection of these platelet precursors impairs subsequent development and maturity, leading to the observed reduction in platelet production. Other alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment may also contribute to poor platelet production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) of bone marrow megakaryocytes in HIV-infected patients has also been postulated as a contributor to thrombocytopenia. In one study, the degree of apoptosis in glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa-positive</span> megakaryocytes purified from the bone marrow of HIV-positive thrombocytopenic patients was inversely related to the circulating platelet count (p&lt;0.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-thrombocytopenia-and-coagulation-abnormalities/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This observation suggests that, in patients with circulating antibodies cross-reacting against glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa,</span> there is increased apoptosis of megakaryocytes as well as increased peripheral destruction of platelets bearing these glycoproteins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary causes of thrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary causes of thrombocytopenia are generally the result of underlying opportunistic infections, malignancy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> comorbid conditions (eg, liver disease, cirrhosis) resulting in hypersplenism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81654\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81654 \">table 1</a>). Patients with HIV infection may also be more susceptible to certain medication-associated thrombocytopenias.

Generally, patients with any sign of bleeding other than petechiae on the skin (eg, any type of mucosal bleeding) are treated. Severe thrombocytopenia in an adult (ie, platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;30,000/microL)</span> is generally treated regardless of whether there are symptoms, due to the risk of serious bleeding. Those with platelet counts &gt;30,000 may not require treatment specifically for the thrombocytopenia, although the platelet count may improve upon treatment to suppress the HIV. Further data regarding what constitutes a safe platelet count are presented separately.

In the context of widespread potent ART therapy, its incidence is far lower (eg, 0.6 percent). The underlying basis for thrombocytopenia in the setting of HIV is thought to be due to immune dysregulation often complicated by coincident liver disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cirrhosis.
