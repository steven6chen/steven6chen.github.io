VZV infection causes two clinically distinct forms of disease: varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Primary VZV infection results in the diffuse vesicular rash of varicella, or chickenpox. Endogenous reactivation of latent VZV typically results in a localized skin infection known as herpes zoster, or shingles.</p><p>Primary varicella infection in children is generally a mild disease compared to more severe presentations in adults or immunocompromised patients of any age. The rates of infection, hospitalizations, and mortality have all declined in the US since the introduction of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> in 1995; immunization is recommended in all children before the age of five years and in nonimmune adults.

Immunosuppressed hosts who develop varicella experience more frequent severe morbidity and higher mortality rates compared to normal hosts.

A retrospective review utilizing a hospital database and national patient registry of rheumatologic diseases, conducted in Spain, evaluated hospitalizations due to chickenpox in patients with rheumatic diseases.
