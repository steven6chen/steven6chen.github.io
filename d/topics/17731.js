Of the cardiovascular deaths, approximately 20 percent can be attributed to the consequences of coronary heart disease (CHD). Patients with varying degrees of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but not yet dialysis dependent, also have a markedly increased risk of morbidity and mortality from CVD, including CHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most of the issues relating to CHD are similar in patients with and without kidney disease. This topic review will emphasize those features of the treatment of CHD that distinguish the dialysis patient from those without kidney disease. Related issues, such as secondary prevention and diagnosis of CHD in dialysis patients, are presented separately.

The reverse may not be true in the chronic dialysis population, especially those with concurrent diabetes. Many dialysis patients with underlying CHD may not have angina. The management of stable angina involves pharmacologic intervention to prevent or minimize ischemia, reduction of risk factors for CHD, and revascularization in some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Overview of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following sections will review the pharmacologic management of stable CHD.

Beta blockers, which reduce cardiac work, and calcium channel blockers, which may dilate the coronary vessels, are preferred in patients with symptomatic angina. Nitrates are also an important therapeutic modality in these patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may also be indicated.

A number of observational studies have evaluated adverse effects (particularly bleeding) associated with these agents, with conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].

Important considerations include hemodynamic stability, bleeding risk, and acute electrolyte fluctuations in the attempt to decrease the risk of hypotension and arrhythmias during this period. Alterations in the hemodialysis prescription may be necessary to lower the risk of intradialytic hypotension that may further impair coronary perfusion and aggravate ischemia. Rapid changes in serum electrolyte concentrations may precipitate or aggravate arrhythmia, especially in the acute coronary syndrome setting. Postponing hemodialysis to the next day is generally preferred when an acute coronary event occurs, if there is no urgent indication. In a chronic dialysis patient with an acute coronary event, hemodialysis on the same day in order to fit into the patient's usual schedule or convenience of the dialysis staff would best be avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">INVASIVE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In nondialysis patients with either stable or unstable coronary artery disease, coronary revascularization can be performed either with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Based upon observational studies, both the mortality after CABG and the complication rate after PCI are increased in patients with ESRD compared with nondialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/18-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-26</a>]. The relative efficacy, indications, advantages, and disadvantages of CABG and PCI with stenting (most commonly with drug-eluting stents) in the general population with CHD are discussed in different topic reviews.

There are no published, randomized studies that have directly compared the efficacy of the different techniques. Only retrospective cohort studies have examined this issue, suggesting that drug-eluting stents are associated with lower early mortality than CABG in the first three months but higher risks for repeat revascularization and mortality than CABG after this period. In general, evidence suggests that the long-term risk of cardiac events <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> death in dialysis patients is generally higher following PCI than after CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/18,19,21,23,26,30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,21,23,26,30-35</a>].</p><p>For these reasons, we and others generally favor CABG rather than PCI in the treatment of coronary disease in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], when revascularization is deemed to be indicated, unless the immediate perioperative mortality associated with CABG is deemed to be too high in a particular patient.

Nevertheless, either CABG or PCI with stenting can be used for coronary revascularization, based upon individual patient characteristics and center preferences. These issues are discussed in detail separately.

Although no randomized, prospective studies and large retrospective studies have been performed, there is increasing evidence in dialysis patients that drug-eluting stents, compared with bare metal stents, are associated with reduced restenosis rates and a decreased requirement for repeat revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/27,28,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,39-42</a>]. We therefore suggest the use of drug-eluting stents rather than other stents because of these findings, as well as the relative benefits observed in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In patients without kidney dysfunction, combined antiplatelet therapy appears to reduce the risk of stent thrombosis.

Dialysis patients have increased risk for bleeding in a randomized, controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In addition, the combination of aspirin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> for the prevention of arteriovenous graft stenosis has been shown to be associated with increased bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Nonetheless, dialysis patients who undergo coronary stent placement should receive combination therapy with aspirin and another antiplatelet agent, such as clopidogrel, if there are no other contraindications and they are appropriately dosed. Careful monitoring for bleeding should be conducted in such patients, and consideration should be made for a decreased heparin dose during dialysis.
