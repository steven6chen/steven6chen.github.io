Unlike the other contact factors (ie, high molecular weight kininogen, factor XII, prekallikrein), FXI is important for normal hemostasis in vivo. It plays an important role in the amplification of the initial coagulation response via a positive feedback mechanism for the generation of additional thrombin.</p><p>The diagnosis and management of factor XI deficiency are discussed here. </p><p>Separate topic reviews discuss other inherited and acquired factor deficiencies, and a general approach to the patient with unexplained bleeding or abnormal coagulation testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained bleeding &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-bleeding-symptoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with bleeding symptoms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained prolonged aPTT &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coagulation-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coagulation tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor VIII and IX deficiency (hemophilia A and B) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare inherited coagulation disorders &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rare inherited coagulation disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired factor inhibitors &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired inhibitors of coagulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGY OF FACTOR XI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human FXI is found in both plasma and platelets, although platelet FXI contributes less than 1 percent of total circulating FXI clotting activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Plasma FXI circulates in complex with high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK). In the presence of zinc ions this complex binds to high affinity sites on the surface of activated platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Prothrombin and calcium ions can substitute for the <span class=\"nowrap\">HMWK/zinc</span> complex, explaining why HMWK deficiency does not lead to a bleeding disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The primary site of FXI synthesis is the liver. Patients with liver disease may therefore have decreased levels of FXI. FXI activity is low at birth and correlates with gestational age; adult levels are reached by six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The source of platelet factor XI and its contribution to hemostasis are unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>There is a single case report of a patient with factor XI deficiency, hepatitis C virus-associated cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, whose factor XI deficiency was corrected after liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>FXI is the zymogen for the active enzyme factor FXIa. Since FXIa is essential for propagation of the coagulation response, its regulation remains crucial. FXIa is regulated by two classes of inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors (serpins) and Kunitz-type inhibitors. The serpins shown to be involved in FXIa inhibition are antithrombin (AT), alpha-1 protease inhibitor, and C1 inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p>Any FXIa that is not bound to platelets, is inhibited by protease nexin-2 (PN2) secreted by activated platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. However, binding of FXIa to the platelet surface protects it from inactivation by PN2, localizing production of thrombin to activated platelets at the site of initial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Role in coagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During plasma clotting assays in vitro, FXI is activated by FXIIa on negatively charged surfaces, known as contact activation. The physiologic role of this activation step is unclear at the present time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Although factor XI does not play an important role in the initiation of blood coagulation in vivo, it is essential for its propagation and maintenance. Normal hemostasis is initiated via the extrinsic pathway involving circulating factor VIIa and tissue factor, which together activate factor X (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62974\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62974 \">figure 1</a>). Activated factor X (factor Xa) and V then convert prothrombin to thrombin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Thrombin generation'</a>.)</p><p>This pathway is rapidly inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), such that only a small amount of thrombin is generated. Although this initial formation of thrombin is sufficient to generate fibrin from fibrinogen, the coagulation process is maintained and amplified only through the subsequent activation of platelets, as well as factors XI, VIII, and V by this initial burst of thrombin formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This supplemental thrombin formation at the site of the clot is also critical for the activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), which stabilizes the clot by increasing its resistance to fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Thus, FXI plays a dual role by both helping to generate additional thrombin and downregulating fibrinolysis. These observations provide an explanation as to why FXI deficient patients do not generally have spontaneous bleeding but are prone to bleeding provoked by trauma or surgery, particularly when tissues with high intrinsic fibrinolytic activity (eg, nose, oral cavity, tonsils, genitourinary tract) are involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Structure and function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The factor XI gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q34-35) and consists of 15 exons and 14 introns. It encodes a 607 amino acid protein with a number of distinctive structural and functional features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Factor XI is unique among the coagulation factors in that it circulates in blood in zymogen form as a disulfide-linked homodimer in a noncovalent complex with high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/2,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22</a>]. Each identical 80 kD monomer can be activated following cleavage at Arg369-Ile370 by its activators, namely thrombin, factor XIIa, and by autoactivation by factor XIa itself, generating two chains. The light chain contains the catalytic site whereas the heavy chain contains the four tandem repeat sequences (apple domains, A1 to A4). The apple domains are not found in other coagulation proteases, with the exception of prekallikrein, and are responsible for substrate and ligand binding as well as the dimerization process itself, mediated through the A4 domain. Production of the homodimer is also essential for the secretion of factor XI from producing cells in the liver. Activated FXI remains in its dimeric form, which is also essential to its normal function of factor IX cleavage and activation.</p><p>Mutations of the FXI gene leading to FXI deficiency can occur in the apple domains or the catalytic site. One of the most common mutations in the Ashkenazi Jews is a missense mutation in the apple 4 domain, which is important for FXI dimerization, resulting in low circulating levels of FXI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Jewish populations'</a> below).</p><p>FXI is the only coagulation protease, with the exception of FXII and prekallikrein, that does not contain &quot;Gla domains,&quot; sequences rich in gamma-carboxyglutamic acids that are required for binding to phospholipids. Despite the absence of Gla domains and its inability to bind to phospholipids, FXI and FXIa bind to activated platelets in a specific and saturable manner.</p><p>Glycoprotein Ib is the platelet receptor for plasma FXI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. FXI binds to the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The non-covalent complexing of HMWK (or prothrombin) to FXI is required for the exposure of the binding site on the A3 domain of FXI to allow its binding to glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIb alpha) on activated platelets. The FXI homodimer binds to GPIb alpha through one of its monomers, leaving the second one free for activation by thrombin, which also binds to the platelet surface GPIb alpha via its exosite II. This provides the proper orientation of thrombin, such that the exosite I and active site of thrombin are properly aligned for their interaction with and activation of FXI. In this model, GPIb alpha plays an important role in co-localizing thrombin and FXI to form a quaternary complex on the activated platelet surface, allowing for the activation of FXI by its physiologic activator (thrombin) on the surface of the activated platelet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H484634\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible protective effects of factor XI deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High levels of FXI have been shown to be a risk factor for thrombosis. In a case-control study from the Leiden Thrombophilia Study, high levels of FXI (ie, &gt;90th percentile) were associated with a doubling of the risk of developing deep venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This observation was confirmed in a second large case-control study showing an odds ratio of 1.8 (95% CI 1.3-2.7) after adjustment for other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The Austrian Study on Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (AUREC), a cohort study, found that individuals with high levels of TAFI, in association with higher levels of factors VIII, IX and XI, had an increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, high levels of FXI have been associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In contrast, Israeli studies in patients with severe FXI deficiency have suggested that FXI deficiency has a protective effect against deep vein thrombosis and stroke but not against myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. </p><p>Since increased levels of FXI increase thrombotic risk, FXI deficiency might act to reduce thrombotic risk via a combination of decreased thrombin generation and increased fibrinolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62974\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62974 \">figure 1</a>). In fact, factor XI has emerged as a target for antithrombotic therapy as shown in preclinical and human trials. In a primate model of AV shunt thrombosis, anti-FXI monoclonal IgGs that block FXI activation was protective at reducing thrombus growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Similarly, reducing plasma FXI level with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology was found to be protective against thrombosis in a baboon AV shunt model as well as a catheter-induced thrombosis model in rabbits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. </p><p>Another clinical trial provided evidence that FXI contributes to postoperative thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this trial, 300 patients undergoing elective unilateral knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to receive a FXI ASO prior to surgery or the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> daily. Lowering plasma FXI levels (to a mean of 20 percent factor level) with the FXI ASO reduced the incidence of postoperative venous thromboembolism to 4 percent (versus 30 percent with enoxaparin), without increasing bleeding risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTOR XI MUTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factor XI deficiency may result from impaired protein production or secretion, dimerization, or by a mechanism of heterodimer trapping in heterozygous individuals.</p><p>Most of the molecular and clinical data concerning FXI deficiency have come from population studies among Jewish patients. The first three mutations of the FXI gene (designated types I to III) were reported in 1989 in six Ashkenazi Jewish patients who had severe factor XI deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A Type IV mutation was reported in 1991 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The type II mutation (E117X) causes a premature chain termination and results in very low levels of circulating FXI, whereas the Type III mutation (F283L) results in impaired dimerization and secretion of the FXI molecule. Both type II and type III point mutations are highly prevalent and occur at approximately equal frequency, whereas types I and IV are rare. Thus, nearly all Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with severe factor XI deficiency have either the <span class=\"nowrap\">II/II,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">III/III,</span> or compound heterozygous (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">II/III)</span> genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>While the bleeding risk appears to be increased in all genotypes when tissues with high fibrinolytic activity are involved, there is a correlation between these genotypes and the level of FXI coagulant activity. A study in Israel of 43 patients with severe FXI deficiency found factor XI levels of 1.2 percent, 3.3 percent and 9.7 percent for genotypes <span class=\"nowrap\">II/II,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">II/III,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">III/III,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Some mutations can cause a moderate to severe FXI deficiency by producing aberrant proteins exerting a pattern of dominant transmission through formation of heterodimers between the mutant and wild-type proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Apparently, these heterodimers are formed intracellularly but are not secretable, leading to a more significant reduction in plasma FXI levels (eg, approximately 20 percent) than usually encountered in patients with heterozygous autosomal recessive FXI deficiency. With rare exceptions, factor XI mutations result in decreased factor XI protein proportionate to the decrease in factor XI clotting activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>].</p><p>Approximately 220 FXI mutations have been reported, affecting both the catalytic and apple domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Many of these are listed in online mutation databases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Combined coagulation deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coinheritance of factor XI deficiency along with another congenital coagulation disorder has been observed on rare occasions. This has included patients with Von Willebrand disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>], factor VII deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], and hemophilia A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>Abnormal bleeding in patients with Noonan syndrome has been associated with a number of alterations in platelet function as well as coagulation factors, including a mild deficiency of factor XI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. The mechanism for such abnormalities is unknown, since the defective gene for Noonan syndrome is on chromosome 12, whereas the factor XI gene is situated on chromosome 4. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonic stenosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INHERITED FACTOR XI DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factor XI deficiency (Rosenthal syndrome, hemophilia C) is an autosomal disorder affecting both men and women, which results in a bleeding disorder of variable severity. It is not truly a recessive disorder, since some heterozygotes may have mild bleeding, while other FXI mutations may lead to an autosomal dominant disease pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">General population</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factor XI deficiency is uncommon among the non-Jewish population and consists mostly of sporadic cases, with an estimated incidence of one case per million population. However, clusters of individuals with factor XI deficiency have been identified within non-Jewish populations. A common ancestral mutation (C128X) was reported in 11 non-Jewish families from the UK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In France, two mutations were identified. One is a mutation (C38R) in exon 3, reported in 8 of 12 families with FXI deficiency in French Basques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The second one is an ancient mutation in exon 4 (Q88X) in individuals from Nantes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Jewish populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital FXI deficiency is common among Ashkenazi Jews (ie, Jews from Eastern Europe), with a rate of heterozygosity as high as 8 to 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Estimates of homozygosity for FXI deficiency among Ashkenazi Jews have varied from 0.22 to 0.53 percent, making congenital FXI deficiency one of the most prevalent genetic defects in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>].</p><p>Other Jewish populations have been screened for mutations of FXI. The type II mutation (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Factor XI mutations'</a> above) is present among Sephardic and Iraqi Jews. Among Iraqi Jews, the heterozygosity rate was found to be 3.3 percent and the risk of homozygosity 0.03 percent, while the type III mutation has not been found in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. This observation suggests that the type II mutation occurred in ancient times while the type III mutation appeared in more recent times.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ACQUIRED FACTOR XI DEFICIENCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25453942\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased production or increased consumption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acquired factor XI deficiency is mainly observed in patients with liver disease, due to failure of production, or following the onset of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), due to increased activation and consumption. Acquired FXI deficiency has also been reported following liver transplantation from a FXI-deficient donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">FXI inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FXI inhibitors (eg, auto- and allo-antibodies) are rare and have been reported in patients with severe congenital FXI deficiency following plasma infusion or in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired inhibitors of coagulation&quot;, section on 'Factor XI inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>An inhibitor to FXI is usually detected in patients either during preoperative screening, following failure to achieve a significant rise of FXI activity after infusion of plasma or FXI concentrates, or in patients with known FXI deficiency who have a worsening bleeding pattern. Most patients with FXI inhibitors do not bleed spontaneously but can bleed seriously during or after trauma or surgery.</p><p>The likelihood of developing a FXI inhibitor is particularly high among individuals with extremely low levels of plasma factor XI who are subsequently exposed to plasma-derived FXI. One study of 118 unrelated individuals with severe congenital FXI deficiency found seven patients who had developed inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. All seven were homozygous for a type II mutation with FXI levels &le;1 percent, and had received plasma replacement therapy. The incidence of an inhibitor among the 21 type II homozygotes who had been previously exposed to plasma infusion was 33 percent. Inhibitors did not develop in untransfused type II homozygotes, or in those with other factor XI mutations. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Factor XI mutations'</a> above.)</p><p>An Rh(D) negative patient who was homozygous for the type II mutation developed a factor XI inhibitor following use of Rh(D) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

There is also a poor correlation between the degree of plasma FXI deficiency and the bleeding tendency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Two studies have suggested that this variability may be explained by differences in thrombin generation, as measured by in vitro thrombin generation or by thromboelastography (TEG), research tests not widely available at the present time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>].</p><p>Unlike classic hemophilia A or B, most patients with severe FXI deficiency (ie, FXI activity &lt;15 percent) do not suffer from spontaneous bleeding but are at risk of bleeding following trauma or surgery. Hemarthrosis and muscle hematomas, common in hemophilia A or B, are not typically observed in FXI deficient patients. Occasional symptoms of FXI deficiency also include easy bruising and epistaxis. Case reports have described spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in the setting of concomitant hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>A retrospective analysis was performed of bleeding complications in 120 patients with severe FXI deficiency who had undergone surgical procedures without replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Procedures performed on tissues exhibiting fibrinolytic activity were associated with bleeding in 49 to 67 percent, while those involving sites with no local fibrinolytic activity were associated with bleeding in 1.5 to 40 percent. The incidence of bleeding following circumcision was 1.5 percent.</p><p>The bleeding risk in patients with heterozygous FXI deficiency is significantly lower than that in homozygous or compound heterozygous patients.

Bleeding risk and need for intervention is especially high for injury or procedures involving tissues with high fibrinolytic activity, such as dental extraction, major surgery, or trauma. Surgery or injury involving tissues with high fibrinolytic activity are definitely associated with higher bleeding risk (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding manifestations'</a> above). &#160;</p><p>Available therapeutic modalities for patients with FXI deficiency include antifibrinolytic agents, fibrin sealant (fibrin glue), Fresh Frozen Plasma, factor XI concentrates (not available in the United States), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (dDAVP), and recombinant human activated factor VII (rFVIIa). (See <a href=\"#H10520743\" class=\"local\">'Available treatment options'</a> below.)</p><p>The decision regarding which treatment(s) to use is determined by the type of intervention planned, the level of FXI activity of the individual patient, and the clinical history of bleeding. We typically use antifibrinolytic agents for lower bleeding risk settings (eg, routine dental surgery, excessive menstrual bleeding) and FFP or FXI concentrates for higher bleeding risk (eg, surgical prophylaxis, symptomatic bleeding). </p><p>Of importance, antiplatelet agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, and other NSAIDs are absolutely contraindicated before surgery, as their presence may increase the risk of bleeding. At other times, these agents are relatively contraindicated.</p><p>Screening for the presence of a FXI inhibitor should be part of the preoperative evaluation, especially in severely deficient individuals with a type II mutation (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'FXI inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Patients with severe FXI deficiency (less than 2 percent) may be best managed with low dose recombinant FVIIa to prevent inhibitor formation.

These indications and details of the specific agents are discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Antifibrinolytic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antifibrinolytic agents alone or as an adjuvant to replacement therapy have been used extensively in FXI deficiency to prevent bleeding in tissues with high fibrinolytic activity, such as the oropharynx and prostate. Antifibrinolytic therapy alone has also been very effective in the treatment of women with FXI deficiency and menorrhagia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">FXI replacement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most surgical procedures do not require prophylaxis with FXI, particularly those not involving areas of high fibrinolytic activity. FXI replacement therapy is warranted for selected cases of surgical prophylaxis or treatment of symptomatic bleeding. This is usually achieved by raising the factor XI level to achieve a nadir or trough level of 30 to 40 percent of normal activity. The recovery of infused FXI in the plasma following infusion is around 90 percent and the half-life of transfused FXI is estimated to be between 50 to 80 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. These characteristics facilitate the postoperative replacement therapy. For major surgeries, the replacement must start before surgery and last approximately five to seven days. There is no need for replacement therapy for minor procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h4\">Fresh-frozen plasma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infusion of fresh frozen plasma is effective in raising FXI levels, but requires the use of large amounts of plasma and carries the potential risk of fluid overload, blood-borne infection, and allergic reactions. Plasma transfusion is most commonly used in the United States, in the absence of FXI concentrates.</p><p>A loading dose of 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> can be followed by 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> every 24 to 48 hours. Use of solvent-detergent frozen plasma reduces the exposure to lipid-enveloped viruses but at a substantially higher cost.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h4\">FXI concentrates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no recombinant factor XI concentrate available. Plasma-derived high purity FXI concentrates that are virally inactivated are not available in the United States (US), but plasma-derived factor XI concentrate that received Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA is being developed for use in the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. FXI concentrates are available in the United Kingdom (FXI concentrate, BPL) and France (Hemoleven, LFB). They are very effective and easy to administer rapidly, achieving a FXI increase of 1.8 to 2.4 percent for every <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg</span> given, and with a half-life of approximately 62 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Hemoleven has been administered at 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> initial dose the evening prior to surgery, then 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> every 72 hours. Alternatively, the dose can be calculated as follows:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dose of FXI (international units) for a goal of 40 percent factor level = weight (kg) x (40 percent - baseline FXI level) x 0.5, to be repeated every 48 to 72 hours depending on residual FXI level</p></div></div><p/><p>However, a number of side effects, including disseminated intravascular coagulation and arterial thrombosis have been reported in about 10 percent of patients receiving these preparations. These complications are particularly common in older patients with preexisting risk factors for thrombosis or in those receiving &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> of factor XI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>]. Heparin and antithrombin are now added during the manufacturing process of these concentrates in order to reduce these risks. It has been recommended by the National Hemophilia Organization (UK) that the dose should not exceed 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> and that the post-infusion FXI level should not exceed 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. With additional data regarding the risk of thrombosis collected from postmarketing surveillance, experts have recommended that initial dose of FXI concentrates should not exceed 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> in most instances to target 30 to 40 percent FXI levels. This is also supported by the observation that lower levels of FXI during orthopedic surgery such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA) appear to be safe while reducing thrombotic risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/35,82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,82,83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Desmopressin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few case series suggest that use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (dDAVP) at a dose of 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> SQ or IV could prevent clinical bleeding when used for surgery in heterozygous FXI deficient patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. However, the efficacy of dDAVP in this setting remains unclear, as many patients also received concurrent treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a>. In a few case series, for example, FXI coagulable activity and antigen levels were only minimally increased following dDAVP infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>].</p><p>A second report evaluated the level of FXI achieved following dDAVP infusion in 33 patients with type 1 Von Willebrand disease or mild hemophilia A, and failed to show any increase in FXI levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. It is possible that the efficacy of dDAVP, if any, is mediated through higher plasma concentrations of both factor VIII and Von Willebrand factor, supporting hemostasis and platelet adhesion in a factor XI-independent manner. The true benefit of dDAVP is unclear; use of this agent should be restricted to a selected group of heterozygous patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Recombinant factor VIIa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several case reports suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viia-activated-recombinant-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human factor VIIa</a> (rhFVIIa), when given along with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a>, is effective for the treatment of patients with FXI deficiency undergoing surgery, including those with inhibitors as well as in those requiring regional anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-xi-deficiency/abstract/66,88-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,88-93</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'FXI inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p>The optimal dose regimen for patients with FXI deficiency is unknown and requires additional clinical data.

In one report, three patients with FXI inhibitors and one with IgA deficiency were treated perioperatively using a single low dose rhFVIIa of 15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> 2 g pre-op and 1 g every six hours for 7 to 14 days.

Factor XI deficiency is an autosomal bleeding disorder common among Ashkenazi Jews. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Biology of factor XI'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Inherited factor XI deficiency'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with severe FXI deficiency (ie, activity &lt;15 percent), the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is prolonged, whereas the prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT) are normal. Depending upon reagent sensitivity, patients with partial FXI deficiency may have a normal aPTT. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical phenotype of severe FXI deficiency is heterogeneous, with a poor correlation between plasma FXI levels and bleeding. Most do not suffer from spontaneous bleeding but are at risk of bleeding following trauma or surgery, and are at higher, variable risk for menorrhagia and postpartum hemorrhage. Twenty to 50 percent of patients with partial FXI deficiency bleed excessively after surgical challenge. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with FXI deficiency do not need prophylaxis for routine daily activity. Prophylaxis is similarly not necessary for some patients with severe deficiency undergoing minor procedures, and for most patients with partial FXI deficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest use of antifibrinolytic agents alone, rather than no therapy or use of factor XI replacement, for those undergoing routine dental surgery as well as for women with excessive menstrual bleeding (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Antifibrinolytic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend the use of FXI replacement therapy with fresh frozen plasma or FXI concentrates for surgical prophylaxis, especially for surgery in areas of high fibrinolytic activity (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>), or for treatment of symptomatic bleeding (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This is usually achieved by raising the factor XI level to achieve a trough level of 30 to 40 percent, starting before surgery and lasting five to seven days. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'FXI replacement therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest the routine use of factor XI replacement during vaginal delivery only in those with a &quot;bleeding phenotype&quot; (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1059902096\" class=\"local\">'Site-specific management guidelines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest the use of antifibrinolytic agents in most patients to prevent postpartum hemorrhage, with the exception of those who are receiving factor XI replacement, as the combination of these two agents may be prothrombotic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
