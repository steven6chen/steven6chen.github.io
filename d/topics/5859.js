Even mild elevations in blood pressure (BP) are associated with increased renal arteriosclerosis in autopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since adequate control of hypertension may slow the rate of renal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the effects of antihypertensive therapy on renal function need to be carefully considered.</p><p>Antihypertensive therapy has both acute and chronic effects on renal function in patients with primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension). In early disease, for example, renal function is usually normal; in this setting, lowering the BP induces little change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-effects-of-ace-inhibitors-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension&quot;</a>). Blacks may have an initial decrease in GFR compared with an increase in whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the chronic and acute effects of antihypertensive therapy in patients with primary hypertension. Goal BP and the choice of antihypertensive agent are discussed in separate topics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with prolonged uncontrolled hypertension are at increased risk of developing chronic renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The risk of this complication is much greater in blacks and in patients with moderate and severe hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62524\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62524 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertensive-complications-in-blacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertensive complications in blacks&quot;</a>.) </p><p>It must be emphasized, however, that the percentage of patients with mild hypertension who develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is relatively small, being less than 1 percent after 16 years in the MRFIT trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypertensive-nephrosclerosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertensive nephrosclerosis&quot;, section on 'Incidence of renal failure'</a>.)</p><p>Prolonged blood pressure (BP) control will usually minimize the degree of renal damage, leading to a stable plasma creatinine concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There are, however, patients in whom proteinuria develops or the plasma creatinine concentration continues to rise slowly over a period of years despite seemingly adequate antihypertensive therapy. This is most likely to occur in blacks, in patients who have underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD) or a family history of ESRD, and in patients with vascular disease, which is suggested by the presence of older age, higher baseline BP, or hyperuricemia.</p><p>Hyperuricemia (independent of diuretic therapy) has been attributed to a reduction in renal blood flow induced by the arterial and arteriolar disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, some have proposed that it may have a key causal role in the onset of primary hypertension, with increased uric acid levels resulting in endothelial dysfunction, vasculopathy, and elevated BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Nevertheless, there is so far little evidence that treatment of hyperuricemia has a role in the treatment of hypertension.</p><p>Why renal damage may progress despite seemingly adequate control of the hypertension is uncertain. It is possible that some of these patients have a different renal disease that is worsened by hypertension (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>). Among blacks, the increased risk for progression of renal disease is likely related to a genetic defect with less contribution from hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis#H9804961\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;, section on 'FSGS in African Americans'</a>.)</p><p>Alternatively, aiming for a BP of <span class=\"nowrap\">140/85</span> to 90 mmHg may be inadequate to prevent renal damage in some patients. It is possible that maintaining a diastolic pressure of 80 mmHg or less would be more beneficial in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;</a>). The suggestion from a large epidemiologic study that higher BP <strong>within the normal range</strong> may be associated with renal injury over a period of many years is compatible with the hypothesis that more aggressive BP control may be beneficial in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. That hypothesis, however, was not supported by the kidney outcomes of the Systolic&nbsp;Blood Pressure&nbsp;Intervention&nbsp;Trial&nbsp;(SPRINT), which had a follow-up of only four to six years (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension#H479320743\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;, section on 'Benefit according to overall cardiovascular risk'</a>).&nbsp;Moreover, based upon the findings of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of a representative sample of the United States population, an estimated 5.6 million people have an elevated serum creatinine that is strongly related to inadequate treatment of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The potential superiority of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be due to the fact that, at least in animal models, these drugs lower the intraglomerular pressure by preferentially decreasing the resistance at the efferent (postcapillary) glomerular arteriole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In human studies, ACE inhibitors have been found to slow the progression of diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In some studies, other drugs that presumably lack this preferential effect on efferent arteriolar resistance have also been found to slow the rate of renal damage, similar to ACE inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, most studies support the notion that ACE inhibitors are more effective in this regard in many forms of proteinuric kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is difficult to assess the relative importance of the specific type of drug versus the effective reduction of BP or the relief of other major risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. However, these considerations are based upon studies performed in patients with known kidney disease, and their importance for patients with primary hypertension is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the long-term renal benefit of antihypertensive therapy in most patients, the initial reduction in blood pressure (BP) may be associated with a transient elevation in the plasma creatinine concentration and a fall in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This effect is most likely to occur with moderate to severe hypertension. The development of renal failure is usually associated with one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A relatively marked and rapid reduction in BP, often exceeding 25 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], although any antihypertensive drug can diminish renal function if the vascular disease is diffuse and severe. In the presence of a drug-induced fall in renal perfusion pressure, angiotensin II participates in the autoregulatory response that attempts to maintain the GFR; this contribution is blocked by an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The development of renal failure is most common in bilateral renal artery stenosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-effects-of-ace-inhibitors-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent volume depletion, most often due to diuretic therapy, which makes maintenance of the GFR more angiotensin II dependent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><p/><p>The impairment in GFR following the institution of antihypertensive therapy is usually reversible.

Particular caution is needed with ACE inhibitors and ARBs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuing antihypertensive therapy is reasonable as long as the rise in the plasma creatinine concentration is less than 30 percent of the pretreatment level. This is based upon the evidence that persistent BP control will lead to regression of arteriolar hyperplasia, and the plasma creatinine concentration will generally return to or occasionally fall below the pretreatment level over a period of weeks to months. In many studies, ACE inhibitors produced a transient initial rise in serum creatinine but a beneficial effect on renal function in the long term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reversing volume depletion by discontinuing excessive diuretic therapy may be beneficial when an unacceptable decline in GFR follows the institution of an ACE inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antihypertensive-treatment-on-renal-function-in-primary-essential-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. If this is ineffective or the patient has not been taking a diuretic, then switching to a drug that does not reduce intraglomerular pressure (such as a calcium channel blocker) is indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for unrecognized bilateral renal artery stenosis should be considered, particularly in older patients with extensive atherosclerosis elsewhere, or if renal function rapidly deteriorates soon after starting a renin suppressing drug.
