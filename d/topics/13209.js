Clinically, AKI is manifested by increases in nitrogenous waste products (blood urea nitrogen [BUN]) and serum creatinine (SCr), and, in some cases, a concomitant reduction in urine output (less than 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour) that may be refractory to diuretic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

With at least 30 different definitions of AKI reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], generalizations across studies and comparisons of different data sets are challenging. As a result, the lack of evidence-based guidelines regarding the management of the pediatric patient with AKI has led to uncertainty and controversy regarding the appropriate timing for the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT), as well as the most appropriate RRT modality.</p><p>The indications, timing, and modalities for RRT for children with AKI will be reviewed here. RRT in adults is discussed separately.

RRT may prevent and correct the adverse and potentially life-threatening complications of AKI including symptomatic uremia, metabolic and electrolyte imbalance, and severe fluid overload, thereby reducing the mortality and length of stay of children with AKI.</p><p>Indicators for the provision of RRT in pediatric AKI have been traditionally extrapolated from the following parameters used for dialysis initiation for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic and electrolyte imbalance not amenable to medical therapy (eg, severe hyperkalemia or metabolic acidosis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic uremia (eg, bleeding, pericarditis, and encephalopathy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe fluid overload leading to hypertension, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure, or heart failure</p><p/><p>However, these indicators are usually late findings of severe kidney dysfunction, and data from adult patients with AKI suggest that earlier initiation of RRT prior to the appearance of these life-threatening complications is associated with better outcomes. Similar data in critically ill children are not available. Thus, based on the adult literature, most pediatric intensivists and nephrologists advocate for earlier implementation of RRT to avoid these late manifestations of AKI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury in adults: Indications, timing, and dialysis dose&quot;, section on 'Timing of elective initiation'</a>.)</p><p>Although the optimal timing and clinical criteria remain unknown, most experts initiate RRT when there is evidence of significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), fluid overload, and metabolic imbalance. While there are insufficient data to support evidence-based guidelines that include quantifiable values for uremia and metabolic disturbances, there are sufficient data to provide guidelines for fluid overload. Specifically, fluid overload greater than 20 percent has been associated with increased mortality when controlled for severity of illness in both single center and multicenter pediatric analyses, and these indices are being used to direct the care of the pediatric patient with AKI at many (but not all) centers.</p><p>The decision to begin RRT is based primarily on the judgement of clinicians in evaluating the level of impairment including the effect of patient factors <span class=\"nowrap\">(age/size,</span> illness acuity, and comorbidities), organizational resources including availability of necessary equipment, and trained and experienced staff.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4746409\"><span class=\"h2\">Severity of AKI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of AKI is generally based on the degree of GFR reduction, which is clinically measured by blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BUN &ndash; The degree of uremia, quantified by BUN concentration, is usually used to measure the severity of AKI and as an indicator for the initiation of RRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Data from adult studies demonstrated improved outcome when RRT was initiated when the BUN reached 90 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> as compared with waiting until the BUN exceeded 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. In addition, a prospective study in adults with AKI reported a higher survival rate in patients initiated on RRT (continuous venous hemofiltration) at a BUN less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> compared with those who received RRT at a higher BUN concentration (30 versus 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Nevertheless, in our practice, we consider the use of RRT when the BUN reaches a level between 80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCr &ndash; Significant increases in SCr occur late in the course of AKI and thus, it is an imperfect marker to determine the appropriate timing of RRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14</a>]. It is affected by muscle mass that varies according to the size, nutritional status, and underlying medical comorbidities of the child. Although data are insufficient, early initiation of RRT before a significant change in SCr appears to improve outcome of children with AKI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Novel biomarkers, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) show promise in both their diagnostic and prognostic utility in the setting of AKI, and may allow for early intervention prior to the onset of SCr rise, severe metabolic derangements, and fluid overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. However, future studies are needed to establish whether any of these markers will provide beneficial guidance in determining the optimal time for RRT initiation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4746416\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have shown that fluid overload is an independent predictor of mortality in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 157 children with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) from the Prospective Pediatric Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (ppCRRT) registry, multivariate analysis, which controlled for severity of illness including the use of mechanical ventilation and inotropic agents, showed that the degree of fluid overload was lower in survivors versus nonsurvivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequent study from the ppCRRT registry of 297 children who received continuous RRT, the mortality rate increased as the degree of fluid overload increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Mortality rates for patients who developed overload greater than 20 percent, between 10 and 20 percent, and less than 10 percent were 66, 43, and 29 percent, respectively. After adjusting for severity of illness and intergroup differences, there was a 3 percent increase in mortality for each 1 percent increase in severity of fluid overload.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At-risk patient populations, such as those who have undergone stem cell transplantation, have a poorer survival outcome with a greater than 10 percent fluid overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p>These findings suggest that early initiation of RRT in patients with MODS is beneficial as it prevents or corrects significant fluid overload, which is associated with increased mortality.</p><p>The 2007 update of the 2002 American College of Critical Care Medicine Clinical Guidelines for Hemodynamic Support of Neonates and Children with Septic Shock includes the suggestion that RRT be considered following early goal-directed fluid resuscitation in patients at risk for worsening fluid overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In these guidelines, once hemodynamic stability is achieved, the patient&rsquo;s fluid status is evaluated by determining the percent fluid overload (FO) using the following equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]:</p><p>Percent FO at RRT initiation = [fluid in (liters) &ndash; fluid out <span class=\"nowrap\">(liters)]/admission</span> weight (kg) X 100</p><p>In addition, RRT may be used to maintain the fluid status of critically ill children who remain oliguric, especially those who are hemodynamically unstable, while administering intravenous fluids including parenteral nutrition and medications, and <span class=\"nowrap\">/or</span> blood products. In this setting, RRT is not used to remove fluid but to prevent further fluid overload, which may lead to worsening respiratory status and cardiac function. Once the patient has achieved a satisfactory level of hemodynamic stability, the process of fluid removal can commence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21365186\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal angina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because there is no reliable marker to determine the severity and prognosis of AKI, the use of collection of clinical risk factors and signs of renal disease has been proposed as a method to identify patients most at risk for developing AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Analogous to assessing the risk of a myocardial infarction in a patient presenting with chest pain, the threshold for &quot;renal angina&quot; would be based on the presence of established AKI risk factors (eg, mechanical ventilation, history of cardiopulmonary bypass, bone marrow transplantation) and evidence of renal disease (fluid overload and changes in serum creatinine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The proposed renal angina criteria stratify patients into moderate-risk, high-risk, and very-high-risk patients according to their underlying clinical condition. For each level of preexisting risk factors, there is a threshold of evidence of injury that a patient must meet to be considered to have renal angina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87768 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>We feel that this AKI scoring system, while still early in development and not yet fully validated and refined, has great potential utility for informing the appropriate timing of initiation of RRT. Patients in the very-high-risk category are likely at greatest risk for &quot;late manifestations&quot; of AKI (metabolic imbalance, symptomatic uremia, severe fluid overload), and therefore would benefit the most from earlier RRT initiation. The addition of novel biomarker confirmation will further enhance our ability to determine which patients would most benefit from initiation of RRT and at what point in the clinical course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H719049\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the critically ill child with AKI in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), our practice is to initiate RRT if the patient has the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>15 percent or greater fluid overload</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oliguria not responsive to diuretics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Escalating ventilatory requirements, especially if related to volume status (prior to intubation is preferred when possible)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need for adequate nutrition, especially when nutrition is compromised by fluid restriction or electrolyte abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need for provision of large volumes of medications or blood products in a patient already &gt;10 percent fluid overloaded</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BUN between 80 and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Life-threatening metabolic derangements (eg, hyperkalemia) that are refractory to medical management</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4746438\"><span class=\"h1\">MODALITY CHOICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The renal replacement therapeutic interventions are based on the exchange (movement) of solute and water between two solutions (eg, blood and dialysate) across a membrane based on the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffusion consists of a solute exchange between two solutions (eg, blood and peritoneal fluid or dialysis fluid) separated by a semipermeable membrane.

PD historically has provided effective therapy for the management of pediatric AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/29-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-37</a>] and continues to provide reasonably cost-effective, efficient therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. PD is widely available in developed and developing countries because it requires less technological expertise and resource allocation, and is more cost-effective than CRRT or HD. PD is critical in the treatment of sepsis-induced AKI in facilities where pediatric HD and CRRT are unavailable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/38,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40</a>].</p><p>PD provides gradual, continuous solute and water clearance through diffusion and ultrafiltration, although the ability to separate these components is somewhat limited with this modality. PD does not require vascular access and thus allows critically ill patients to be dialyzed with preservation of vasculature for future needs. Access for PD can be quickly and safely obtained, even in hemodynamically unstable patients, thus allowing for the rapid institution of therapy. Typical access includes Tenckhoff catheters usually placed by pediatric surgeons, or acute PD or adapted PD catheters placed at the bedside percutaneously in patients unable to tolerate a surgical placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>The components of the PD prescription include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysate composition &ndash; The composition of commercially available dialysate solutions vary depending upon their osmolality, and the osmotic agent (usually dextrose) and buffer used. The composition can be modified based on the patient's needs. Three different dextrose solutions are available commercially: 1.5, 2.5, and 4.25% solutions with respective osmolalities of 346, 396, and 485 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L</span>. In patients with hepatic dysfunction, lactate as a buffer should be avoided. Commercially prepared bicarbonate-based solutions are not available in the United States because of incompatibility with calcium and magnesium. Customized bicarbonate solutions with electrolyte modification can be prepared by hospital pharmacies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>], although prescription errors pose a significant risk to patient safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The dextrose used in PD dialysate can provide an extra source of carbohydrate nutrition and calories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46</a>]; on the other hand, it may also lead to hyperglycemia necessitating insulin correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

However, the ability to provide adequate dosing of dialysis in the AKI setting is problematic when using PD in the most critically ill patients. These patients, who may have severe fluid overload, lactic acidosis, and hypotension, require precise fluid balance with controlled ultrafiltration, yet may not have adequate blood flow (cardiac output) to the peritoneum to allow for efficient solute and fluid removal. Pressor agents may alter peritoneal blood flow in septic patients, further diminishing these processes. Thus, in patients with sepsis-induced AKI the beneficial aspects of slow solute clearance and ultrafiltration provided by PD also limit its effectiveness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172029046\"><span class=\"h3\">Contraindications and complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PD is absolutely contraindicated in patients with diaphragmatic defects. PD can be used to support patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts, prune belly syndrome, abdominal surgeries, and ventilation via the high-frequency oscillator, though these situations may present some technical challenges for catheter placement (eg, thin abdominal wall in patients with prune-belly syndrome) and come with higher risk of catheter leak.</p><p>Patients with preload dependent cardiac physiology may become unstable with filling and draining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/11,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,37</a>], necessitating the use of tidal PD prescriptions or an alternative modality. Patients with pulmonary compromise may worsen with increased abdominal dialysate volumes that may prevent full diaphragmatic excursion. Additional complications with PD include peritonitis, hernias, catheter malfunction, and hydrothorax due to dialysate leakage into the pleural space. Patients may have significant losses of immunoglobulins in the dialysate, making them more susceptible to infection. Peritonitis can enhance dialysate protein loss, compromise nutrition, and permanently damage the peritoneal membrane.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4746469\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent hemodialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent HD provides more efficient solute clearance and ultrafiltration compared with other RRT modalities. In the hemodynamically stable patient, no other modality is better suited for rapid and accurate small solute reduction with or without ultrafiltration. Thus, this therapy is particularly important in the pediatric population for the treatment of acute and life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hyperkalemia), ingestions (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a>), drug toxicity (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a>), tumor lysis syndrome, and hyperammonemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/27,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,48,49</a>]. Most secondary or tertiary care centers have the equipment and expertise to offer this therapy to the pediatric patient.</p><p>Access is one of the most important components leading to the satisfactory provision of HD. A wide variety of temporary vascular catheters are available for the pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The placement of acute catheters can be performed in most children at the bedside by pediatric nephrologists or intensivists. Placement of semipermanent tunneled catheters and acute catheters in very small infants is usually done in the operating room by surgeons or interventional radiologists. Placement of the catheter in the neck veins allows for less recirculation and avoids the potential high venous return pressures often associated with groin lines in patients with high intra-abdominal pressures. In neonates, the use of umbilical veins may be considered if no other options are available.</p><p>Complications related to the placement of acute or permanent vascular catheters include blood vessel sclerosis or thrombosis, introduction of air emboli, or hemorrhage. Depending on location or degree of difficulty involved in placing these catheters, future vascular access needs may be compromised, an issue of great importance in patients who may progress from acute to chronic kidney injury and eventually end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In particular, subclavian veins should be avoided, in order to preserve these vessels for future use as arteriovenous fistulas in patients who may progress to end-stage renal disease. As with all central lines, vascular catheters are a potential source of infection.</p><p>The components of the HD prescription include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood flow rate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysate flow rate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysate composition, which may be changed based on patient needs.

However, it may not be tenable in the smallest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sickest patients who present to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). These patients require experienced and trained pediatric dialysis personnel to deliver HD safely to patients with small blood volumes who cannot tolerate rapid fluid shifts. In these cases, the hemodynamic instability and labile nature of the patient's condition may render PD or CRRT better RRT options. In addition, the blood volume required to prime the dialysis circuit and single-lumen vascular access have limited the use of HD in infants and young children who weigh less than 8 kg. A newly developed dialysis machine for infants weighing between 0.8 and 8 kg that uses a single-lumen line and does not require blood priming is being evaluated for efficacy and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Careful dosing, dialysate solution selection, and monitoring are required to prevent osmolar shifts that can cause cerebral edema with subsequent mental status changes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> seizures (referred to as dialysis disequilibrium) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Most oligo-anuric patients treated with HD require fluid restriction because many patients will not tolerate removal of large fluid volumes over the short treatment times typically used with HD. Daily intermittent HD is an option, but will not eliminate the need for at least some fluid restriction, which in turn, may limit the amount of nutritional support provided. Finally, hypotension in the critically ill patient will limit the capacity for ultrafiltration and ultimately the ability to provide adequate treatment with this modality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4746485\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous renal replacement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRRT includes dialysis (diffusion-based solute removal) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> filtration (convection-based solute and water removal) treatments that operate in a continuous mode. Over the past 10 years, CRRT has supplanted PD as the primary modality choice for the treatment of the critically ill pediatric patient in many PICUs, as CRRT has improved delivery of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>CRRT mimics native renal function with its continual ultrafiltration and solute clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>], and has several advantages over HD and PD in the management of patients with AKI.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRRT is more precise in delivering the goals of solute clearance and ultrafiltration than PD. Although PD provides continuous solute clearance and ultrafiltration, the rates of clearance are variable and dependent on the patient's clinical status. CRRT can control ultrafiltration separately from solute removal, which PD cannot, allowing for greater flexibility within the prescription.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because ultrafiltration is continuous and can be adjusted to meet the patient's needs with CRRT, there is usually no need for fluid restriction unlike that required in patients managed by HD. CRRT allows for administration of all necessary blood products, large volumes of medications, and adequate nutrition without compromising the volume status of the patient. However, supplemental protein (up to 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">gm/kg/day)</span> may be required during CRRT because amino acid loss can be quite high with this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRRT provides superior uremia control compared with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/39,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,56</a>] or HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p/><p>Dialysate or filter replacement fluid customization is possible, allowing for rapid alteration of electrolyte levels targeted to a desired range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, because of potential pharmacy compounding errors when manually preparing custom solutions, caution needs to be exercised when performing these alterations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>The main disadvantages of CRRT are its complexity and expense, and risk of hemorrhage, which may be aggravated by coagulopathy in a critically ill patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. While it is an established therapy at many tertiary care hospitals in developed countries, CRRT requires significant technological expertise and resource allocation, such that it may be more costly than PD or HD. Specialized nursing education and pharmacy support are necessary for safe and proper provision of CRRT. Although new technology, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of both commercially available dialysate and filter replacement solutions and readily available anticoagulation protocols have improved safety, though these new technologies have also increased costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/28,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,60</a>].</p><p>Other drawbacks include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central line access &ndash; Like HD, adequate vascular access is essential. An additional central line may also be required for the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">calcium chloride</a> as part of regional citrate anticoagulation protocols.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limitations for small infants and neonates &ndash; Despite the availability of smaller circuits that are modifications of existing adult systems, the large extracorporeal volume required for CRRT (as well as HD) may exceed 10 percent of the patient's blood volume in infants. Even in pediatric tertiary centers, for patients who weigh less than 5 kg, the circuits must be primed with blood, which may expose these infants to transfusion risks and hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. These circuits are also more likely to use heparin for anticoagulation, which increases the risk of bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Case reports and small case series have reported the successful use of smaller circuits that require low blood priming volumes (&lt;33 mL) in critically ill infants, including neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. In most cases, vascular access was obtained by using 4 to 4.5 French dual-lumen catheters, and in some infants, two 4 French single-lumen catheters. Although these platforms represent a major step towards the development of appropriately sized and safe technology for neonates and infants, further experience is needed to determine whether there is adequate solute clearance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effect on medications &ndash; Careful attention must be paid to medications that a patient is receiving because CRRT may alter the clearance of these drugs, especially those that are of lower molecular weight, water soluble, and not highly protein bound.</p><p/><p>Technologic advances have incorporated the different CRRT options into one commercially available platform. Ongoing research is trying to determine which modality is better suited for specific patient conditions. Convective therapies (CVVH and CVVHDF) provide superior middle molecule clearance compared with diffusive therapy (CVVHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. These convective modalities are thought to be superior in clearing proinflammatory cytokines, and may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with sepsis-related AKI. However, there are only limited observational data in pediatric stem cell transplant recipients with AKI that suggest improved survival with convective CRRT therapies (CVVH, CVVHDF) compared with diffusive therapy (CVVHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4746501\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparisons of modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been no randomized clinical trials comparing the three modalities (PD, HD, and CRRT) for treatment of children with AKI. Several trials in adults have demonstrated no difference in survival between CRRT and HD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury in adults: Indications, timing, and dialysis dose&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Observational data in children with AKI include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective population-based study from the United Kingdom of children who received RRT from 2005 to 2012 reported improved survival with PD compared with CRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter retrospective study of 226 children who received RRT from 1992 to 1998, survival rates were 40, 49, and 81 percent for HF, PD, and HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, in this cohort, the use of inotropic pressors was the most important factor for survival, and its use was greatest in children on HF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 42 children following congenital heart disease repair, there was no difference in mortality between patients who were treated with PD and CRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, CRRT was superior to PD in terms of fluid balance, solute clearance, and ability to provide adequate nutrition.</p><p/><p>Available evidence for the optimal treatment is limited by the lack of control for confounding factors, such as severity of illness and underlying etiology of AKI. This lack of data has left unresolved the persistent debate on whether initiation of CRRT contributes to kidney injury by reducing renal blood flow. </p><p>Although an alternate medical approach to treat pediatric AKI has been proposed, which uses a regimen of high-dose diuretics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medications to augment renal blood flow (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dopamine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-acute-kidney-injury-indications-timing-and-choice-of-modality-for-renal-replacement-therapy-rrt/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], this approach increases the metabolic demand of the kidneys, which has the potential to be more harmful than CRRT. As a result, further research is needed to determine the best approach to treat pediatric AKI. In particular, randomized trials that compare regimens of early initiation of CRRT, AKI medical management (eg, diuretics), and current standard care would be useful in guiding clinical decision making in children with AKI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4746509\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCONTINUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The factors determining when or how RRT should be discontinued (or transitioned to another modality) are less well described than the factors determining initiation. Although step-down case reports exist for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) after hemodialysis (HD) in patients with inborn errors of metabolism and toxic overdose, no approach has been defined for patients with AKI. Just as with initiation, RRT cessation or modality change is influenced by multiple factors such as urine output (including response to diuretic therapy), hemodynamic stability, respiratory, nutritional and volume status, and changes in underlying disease and overall prognosis. Other considerations may include ongoing resource use, staff availability, family wishes, and long-term patient needs. For example, if a patient with multiorgan failure has improved and is at the point of extubation, it may be reasonable to change the patient from a continuous therapy to intermittent HD to facilitate patient rehabilitation and transfer from the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) to the ward.</p><p>Guidelines or strategies have not been published regarding transitioning patients off of RRT.
