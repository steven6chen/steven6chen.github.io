An understanding of the risk factors for HIV infection lies at the foundation of successful preventive strategies, which should combine both behavioral and biomedical interventions to reduce HIV infection risk.</p><p>This topic reviews these risk factors and prevention strategies. More detailed discussion on particular prevention strategies, including pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV are found elsewhere.

The distribution of the modes of transmission of HIV infection varies in different countries. In the United States, male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use (IDU) account for more than half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The estimated lifetime risk of an HIV diagnosis in the United States is 1 in 6 for men who have sex with men (MSM), 1 in 23 for women with IDU, and 1 in 36 for men with IDU, in contrast to 1 in 241 and 1 in 473 for heterosexual women and men, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>In contrast, in resource-limited areas, penile-vaginal intercourse is responsible for 70 to 80 percent of HIV infections, perinatal transmission and IDU account for 5 to 10 percent each, and a smaller but growing proportion of cases are among MSM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Since stigma remains a major problem hindering the study of MSM in resource-constrained countries, it seems clear that the incidence and prevalence of HIV in MSM in these settings needs far greater attention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Global epidemiology of HIV infection&quot;, section on 'Modes of transmission driving the epidemic'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525605897\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk of HIV infection varies by type of sexual or parenteral exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60145\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60145 \">table 1</a>). However, estimates of risk are mostly based on observational studies and are difficult to quantify since transmission risk also depends on other cofactors that greatly enhance (and occasionally reduce) the probability of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. As an example, risk factors for HIV transmission include high viral load in the source patient, and risk factors for HIV acquisition after exposure include sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and lack of circumcision, as well as certain host and genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3184227180\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectiousness of source</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525606004\"><span class=\"h3\">Viremia in the source individual</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all modes of transmission, a higher viral load in the HIV-infected source individual is associated with a greater risk of transmission. Viral load depends on several factors, most importantly whether the individual is taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the stage of HIV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/6,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,13</a>]. Individuals with viral suppression on ART rarely if ever transmit infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>], whereas the risk of transmission appears higher during acute than chronic infection in untreated people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. </p><p>In studies of heterosexual couples, those who transmit HIV have higher levels of HIV RNA than those who do not transmit HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/6,9,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,17,18</a>]. As an example, in a study of 415 HIV-serodiscordant couples in Uganda, the baseline serum viral load was higher among transmitting partners than non-transmitting partners (90,000 versus 38,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For each log increase in viral load, there was a 2.5-fold increase in the risk of transmission. In contrast, there were no HIV transmission events from HIV-infected partners whose baseline viral load was &lt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> suggesting a threshold viral level for transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Accordingly, higher viral load in the genital secretions also increases the probability of HIV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Similar findings have been described for perinatal HIV transmission. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings#H328751\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiretroviral and intrapartum management of pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'HIV viremia and risk of infant infection'</a>.)</p><p>The viral load can be very high in patients with acute HIV infection or in those with advanced untreated AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Acute infection is also associated with increased viral shedding in genital secretions for several weeks after infection compared with the stable lower levels seen in chronic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Accordingly, in several studies, the risk of transmission of HIV appears highest from patients with acute HIV infection and higher from patients with late-stage disease (ie, AIDS) compared with chronic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/19,21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21-25</a>]. One modeling study estimated that 38 percent of all HIV transmissions in Malawi were attributable to sexual contact with acutely infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A phylogenetic analysis of patients with acute and early HIV infection, including mostly men who have sex with men, was similarly suggestive of transmission networks during early infection, with evidence of infection with viruses that could be grouped into closely related clusters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Additionally, some animal data also support an increase in viral infectivity during newly-acquired infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3180981969\"><span class=\"h3\">Virus in genital fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, lower levels of blood plasma HIV RNA are associated with decreased genital HIV RNA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, several studies have shown that HIV can still be intermittently detected in seminal fluid of some HIV-infected men, despite suppression of HIV viremia with ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]. HIV can often be detected in the vaginal secretions of women despite the use of ART that suppresses replication in blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Among men, detectable HIV in the semen despite undetectable plasma HIV levels has been associated with a concurrent STI or urethritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, it is unclear whether detectable virus in the genital fluid when plasma virus is undetectable poses a significant transmission risk in serodiscordant couples. A meta-analysis in 5021 heterosexual discordant couples with 461 HIV transmission events found no evidence of transmission from a HIV-infected partner with treatment-induced viral suppression, although the number of person years of follow-up was low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H525607733\" class=\"local\">'Treatment as prevention (TaSP)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525606308\"><span class=\"h3\">Source with unknown HIV status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often the HIV status of the sexual or injecting partner is unknown. The probability of HIV acquisition from a source person whose HIV status is unknown is approximated by estimating the likelihood that the source is HIV-infected multiplied by the likelihood of transmission. As an example, in the United States, the prevalence of HIV infection in men aged 18 to 39 in the NHANES study (2003 to 2006) was 0.43 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Thus, the estimated risk of transmission following a single random episode of receptive vaginal intercourse in the United States would be approximated by multiplying 0.0043 times 0.001 for an estimate of 0.0000043 (ie, 1 in ~233,000). </p><p>However, specific information about the source may increase the likelihood that the he or she is HIV-infected (eg, a history of injection drug use). Furthermore, such calculations are completely different in parts of the world, such as many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV infection is far more prevalent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525606328\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual transmission risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact risk of transmission of HIV with sexual exposure is incompletely defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/6,7,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,35</a>]. However, the data do suggest that risk of HIV acquisition varies by type of exposure (ie, sexual acts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/36-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-41</a>]. </p><p>The risk of acquiring HIV after rape by an unknown assailant depends on many factors specific to the assault. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525606554\"><span class=\"h3\">Sexual behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of HIV transmission varies widely depending on the type of sexual exposure. In general, exposures that lead to mucosal disruption and bleeding are associated with higher risk than other exposures. Unprotected anal intercourse conveys the greatest probability of HIV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Other behavioral factors, such as whether condoms were used, the number of sexual partners, or sex under the influence of recreational drugs, also affect the overall risk of HIV infection. As an example, in a study of 3257 men who have sex with men (MSM) in six US cities, risk factors for HIV acquisition included history of a large number of sexual partners, unprotected receptive anal sex with a partner with an unknown HIV serostatus, and use of nitrate inhalants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>The risk of HIV transmission for different types of sexual exposure to HIV in discordant couples has been estimated using different methods (generally through modeling studies) and cohorts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60145\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60145 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Receptive anal intercourse &ndash; One transmission per 72 sex acts </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insertive anal intercourse &ndash; One transmission per 900 sex acts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Receptive penile-vaginal intercourse &ndash; One transmission per 1250 sex acts </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insertive penile-vaginal intercourse &ndash; One transmission per 2500 sex acts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Receptive or insertive penile-oral sex &ndash; Zero to four transmissions per 10,000 sex acts</p><p/><p>However, these risk estimates make it difficult to understand the magnitude of the HIV pandemic. Clinicians need to be aware that such estimates of risk are often based on studies of monogamous couples, among whom amplifying factors have been treated and repeated exposure may offer as yet unexplained protection from infection. There are scant empiric data on per contact risk of exposure. Additionally, differences in infectivity are also strongly influenced by the presence of other cofactors, such as concomitant genital ulcerative disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As an example, some models suggest that rates of HIV transmission may be as high as one transmission event for every three episodes of insertive anal sex between a male source with late-stage disease and a susceptible female with genital ulcerative disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Thus, using a single value for assessing risk of HIV transmission based on route of sexual exposure fails to reflect the variation associated with other important cofactors. </p><p>HIV transmission among MSM is generally higher than among heterosexual partners. Among heterosexual partners, male-to-female transmission may be slightly more common (ie, efficient) than female-to-male transmission, as observed for most STIs. The relative risk of male-to-female compared with female-to-male HIV transmission was well illustrated in one study of 563 HIV serodiscordant couples (including 156 HIV-infected females and 400 HIV-infected males), in which 19 male partners and 82 female partners acquired HIV during the course of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This study suggested that male-to-female transmission was 1.9 times more efficient (95% CI 1.1-33) than female-to-male transmission.</p><p>Notably, female-to-female sexual transmission of HIV has only rarely been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525606697\"><span class=\"h3\">Lack of circumcision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV acquisition rates among uncircumcised males are higher than for circumcised males. The biologic basis for this observation may be related to a high density of HIV target cells in male foreskin, including Langerhans cells and macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Randomized controlled trials in Africa have demonstrated that circumcision reduces the risk of female-to-male HIV transmission by 50 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>], and this benefit is sustained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, male circumcision of HIV-infected men does not appear to decrease the risk of HIV transmission to the female partner, and efficacy in men who have sex with men has not been demonstrated. (See <a href=\"#H525608279\" class=\"local\">'Male circumcision'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525606791\"><span class=\"h3\">Sexually transmitted infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concurrent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been long known to increase the risk of both acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. The increased risk is widely acknowledged for STIs that cause genital ulcer disease but is also described with other STIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. It has also been associated with the change in vaginal flora that characterizes bacterial vaginosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. </p><p>Several studies have demonstrated an increased incidence of HIV infection among patients with genital ulcerative diseases, such as herpes simplex virus and syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/19,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,56,57</a>]. As an example, in a study of 174 monogamous Ugandan couples with discordant HIV serostatus, the probability of transmission was approximately four times higher in patients with genital ulceration compared to those without [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The effect of these infections on HIV risk is discussed in detail elsewhere.

In a prospective study of 242 South African women with high-risk sexual behavior, 28 became infected with HIV over 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Presence of a concurrent STI was associated with an increased risk of infection with HIV (hazard ratio [HR] 3.29, 95% CI 1.5-7.2). The incremental risk for HIV infection with <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> infection was greater than that with other infections (<em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>, <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>).

These include a deep injury, injury with a device that was visibly contaminated with the source individual's blood, injury with a needle that had been placed in a vein or artery, and terminal illness in the source individual. The volume of blood contributes to the probability of transmission since the reported risk of HIV acquisition after transfusion with a contaminated unit of blood ranges from 88 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The serodiscordant couples were randomly assigned to an &quot;early ART&quot; arm (initiation of HIV treatment at enrollment) or &quot;delayed ART&quot; arm (initiation of HIV treatment when the CD4 count dropped to less than 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or after an AIDS-related illness). ART consisted mainly of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>. After 1.7 years of follow-up, interim analysis demonstrated that early ART substantially reduced the risk of HIV transmission to the partner compared with delayed ART (1 versus 27 linked transmissions, as determined by viral sequencing; HR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.26). Following these results, ART was offered to the HIV-infected participants in the delayed ART group who had not yet initiated it; by the end of the study, 96 percent of the delayed group had started on ART. After a median of 5.5 years and 8904 couple-years of follow-up, the prevention benefits were sustained: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A total of 46 linked transmissions were identified. Three occurred in couples originally assigned to the early ART group compared with 43 in the delayed ART group (93 percent risk reduction with early ART). A total of eight linked transmissions occurred after the HIV-infected partner had initiated ART, but they either occurred within three months of ART initiation or in the setting of ART failure. Thus, no linked transmission events occurred when the HIV-infected partner had achieved stable viral suppression on ART.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were an additional 16 HIV infections in each group. Of these, 14 in the early ART group and 12 in the delayed ART group were determined by viral sequencing to be genetically unlinked (ie, the source was not the individual's documented partner). An additional six infections (two in the early ART and four in the delayed ART group) could not be sequenced for technical reasons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, the incidence of HIV infection in the study was low (0.9 percent per year overall and 2.2 events per 100 person years in the delayed ART group at the interim analysis), which potentially reflects other risk reduction strategies in this study. All participants received condoms and risk reduction counseling. Complete adherence to condom use was independently associated with a reduced risk of both linked and unlinked HIV infections. </p><p/><p>The efficacy of ART in reducing the risk of HIV transmission to an uninfected sexual partner has also been supported by several observational studies among heterosexual discordant couples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/14,15,67-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,67-75</a>]. As an example, in a large retrospective study of almost 39,000 such couples in China, the incidence of HIV infection among uninfected partners was lower if the infected partner was on ART versus untreated (1.3 versus 2.6 infections per 100 person years, respectively, adjusted HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.65&ndash;0.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Similarly, in a large population-based prospective cohort study of HIV-uninfected individuals in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where transmission is predominantly through heterosexual sex, HIV infection risk was lower in communities with high ART coverage compared with areas of low ART coverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Such ecological studies, which examine relationships between exposures and outcomes at the group level, have a number of methodological challenges, including selection bias, confounding, and assumptions about the time lag of effects, which limit the ability to link the exposure to the outcome for the individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/70,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,77</a>]. Nevertheless, these results indicate the importance of ART as a prevention strategy. </p><p>Although most studies of treatment as prevention have included condom use counseling as part of the preventive strategy, studies evaluating serodiscordant couples who specifically do not use condoms also suggest that successful ART prevents transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These data are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H1946815802\" class=\"local\">'Counseling on condom use'</a> below.) </p><p>The efficacy of treatment as prevention is also reflected in the reduction in the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV with successful ART of the mother during pregnancy and delivery.

Several observational studies have suggested that ART prevents sexual transmission among MSM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/15,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,78</a>]. As an example, a study of 234 MSM serodiscordant couples in Australia, Thailand, and Brazil did not detect any linked transmission over 88 couple years during which the infected partner was on suppressive ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525608011\"><span class=\"h3\">Test and treat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some modeling studies have suggested that biomedical interventions could have a significant impact on decreasing HIV transmission in HIV endemic countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>]. In one model, it was assumed that all patients in Africa 15 years of age or older were tested for HIV infection and all newly diagnosed patients were immediately started on ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. With this &quot;test-and-treat&quot; strategy, the model estimated that the incidence of HIV would decline to 1 case per 1000 persons within 10 years. Emerging data on decreased HIV transmission with effective HIV treatment suggest that any cost-analysis of ART must consider the benefits of HIV therapy not only on overall morbidity and mortality but also on HIV transmission risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>]. One analysis that took both these effects into account suggested that ART initiation at presentation (versus waiting until CD4 cell count decreased to below 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> would be very cost-effective in resource-limited settings over the scope of a patient's lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>Modeling exercises must also try to account for acute HIV infection, but the extent of the role of acute infection in driving the HIV epidemic is an area of controversy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/85-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-87</a>]. Patients with acute HIV infection are hard to identify, have high viral load, and may be at the center of HIV transmission clusters (especially among MSM). If acute HIV infection plays a substantial role in incident infections, then test and treat strategies alone cannot realize maximal success. </p><p>Other concerns about population level prevention are travel and mixing of populations. As an example, one study used viral phylogenetics and spatial clustering statistics to demonstrate that a fair proportion of new infections in Rakai, Uganda were introduced from outside the community, including from HIV-infected individuals in a fishing village [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Treatment of HIV-infected individuals in a given community could not be expected to reduce incident infections that resulted from outside visitors.</p><p>To determine the population level benefit of early treatment, community-based trials in Botswana, South Africa, Zambia, and Uganda have been launched [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In one of these, HIV status was ascertained for over 23,000 people in defined study communities in South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The communities, among which 7630 (33 percent) HIV-infected individuals were identified, were randomly assigned to clinics where ART was given immediately (intervention) or according to national guidelines (control). Although there was no difference in the incidence of HIV infection between the intervention and control communities, this was likely because of insufficient ART coverage overall (baseline 32 percent, increasing to 54 percent by the end of the trial), similar ART coverage in the arms of the study due in part to evolving national guidelines resulting in earlier treatment, and the limited number of men treated. </p><p>Nevertheless, emerging evidence from other community-based trials has supported the feasibility of a test and treat strategy. In an observational analysis of a trial from Uganda and Kenya, initiation of annual HIV screening and immediate linkage to care for ART initiation among a cohort of over 75,000 residents were associated with increases in the proportion of HIV-infected individuals who were diagnosed (65 percent at baseline to 96 percent two years later), in the proportion of diagnosed patients who initiated ART (80 to 93 percent), and in the proportion of the total HIV-infected population who achieved viral suppression (45 to 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The impact of the test and treat intervention on HIV incidence within those communities is yet to be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525608113\"><span class=\"h2\">Condom use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consistent condom use effectively decreases the risk of sexual HIV transmission and acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/92-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">92-95</a>]. In 2009, a collaborative statement from the American College of Physicians and the HIV Medicine Association called for wider availability of condoms and education about their proper use to minimize the risk of HIV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. In order for condom use to be effective in decreasing HIV prevalence, they need to be used consistently and with ongoing exposures, particularly in areas of high prevalence. </p><p>The majority of evidence for condom effectiveness is from observational studies. In a meta-analysis of 12 studies of HIV heterosexual serodiscordant couples, condom usage was classified in three categories: always, sometimes, or none [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. HIV infection rates were much higher in those who never used condoms versus those who always did (6.7 versus 0.9 infections per 100 person years). A subsequent analysis of these studies suggested that condoms are 90 to 95 percent effective when used consistently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. A similar Cochrane review estimated that the consistent use of male latex condoms, defined as using a condom for all acts of penetrative vaginal intercourse, reduces HIV incidence by 80 percent, based on several longitudinal female-to-male and male-to-female serodiscordant couples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Additionally, in a trial of ART to reduce HIV transmission within serodiscordant couples, a self-report of &quot;100 percent use&quot; of condoms compared with &quot;less than 100 percent use&quot; was associated with decreased HIV transmission (HR 0.35; 0.14-0.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. These clinical studies are consistent with the in vitro finding that latex and polyurethane condoms are impenetrable to HIV viral particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. </p><p>Since women are often unable to convince their partners to use a condom, there is a need to assess other barrier methods that women can initiate. Female condoms are also impervious to viruses, including HIV; however, there are few clinical data regarding efficacy in prevention of HIV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525608279\"><span class=\"h2\">Male circumcision</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525608285\"><span class=\"h3\">HIV infection in heterosexual men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexual men becoming infected with HIV.

In these trials, men were randomly assigned to an intervention group, in which immediate circumcision was offered, or a control group, in which circumcision was delayed until the end of the study. In all cases, circumcisions were performed by clinicians experienced in the procedure and were rarely associated with moderate or severe adverse effects. These three trials were all ended early because of evidence of reduced HIV incidence in the intervention groups: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial in Orange Farm, South Africa, circumcision reduced the risk of HIV infection by 60 percent among 3274 men aged 18 to 24 years (20 versus 48 new infections in the circumcision and control groups, respectively, after a mean follow-up of 18 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Following trial closure, the majority of uncircumcised men underwent circumcision. After five years, circumcision remained associated with a lower HIV risk (0.5 versus 1.93 new infections per 100 person years in circumcised and uncircumcised men, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p>Population studies in Africa following wider availability and encouragement of voluntary medical male circumcision have also suggested an association between circumcision and reduced incidence of HIV infection and have continued to demonstrate safety of the practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/75,101-103\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,101-103</a>]. </p><p>Data from the United States are limited. One study examined visit records of heterosexual African-American men who underwent HIV testing while attending STI clinics in Baltimore from 1993 to 2000 and analyzed the association between circumcision and the risk of HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. &quot;Known&quot; HIV risk was defined as patient notification by either their sexual partner or by an intervention specialist from the partner notification system of recent HIV exposure. Among 394 visits by patients with known exposure, circumcision was associated with lower HIV prevalence (10.2 percent versus 22 percent; adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 0.49 [95% CI 0.26-0.93]). In the United States, however, the majority of sexually-acquired HIV infections are among men who have sex with men (MSM), among whom circumcision does not have established benefit with regard to HIV risk. (See <a href=\"#H525608549\" class=\"local\">'HIV infection in MSM'</a> below.)</p><p>Any policy to promote circumcision to protect against HIV infection needs to take into account cultural and human rights considerations, the risk of complications from the procedure performed in various settings, the prevalence of infection, and the potential to undermine existing protective behaviors and prevention strategies that reduce the risk of HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/50,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,105</a>]. Results from observational studies of men who underwent circumcision suggest that this prevention intervention is not necessarily offset by an adverse behavioral impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>].

Results of these studies suggest that HIV transmission from men to their sexual partners reflects the HIV concentration in genital secretions (ie, semen) rather than exposure to the uncircumcised glans penis. </p><p>In a trial from Uganda, 922 HIV-infected men with CD4 cell counts &ge;350 cells were randomly assigned to immediate versus delayed circumcision for 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Circumcision did not reduce HIV transmission to the HIV-uninfected female sexual partners; over a 24-month period, the cumulative probability of female acquisition of HIV was 22 percent in the intervention group and 13 percent in the control group (adjusted HR 1.49; 0.52-3.57). In addition, excess HIV transmission occurred within the first six months in the male circumcision arm, particularly among those who resumed intercourse prior to wound healing.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p>Population-based studies have generally been unable to show a decrease in HIV incidence with treatment or prevention of STIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/120,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,121</a>]. It is generally concluded that STI treatment to prevent HIV infection requires treatment of just the right STI pathogen, at just the right time, with effective agents, goals that are not readily achieved. Additionally, the findings in these studies may reflect problems with methodology, patient adherence, and overlapping interventions in the control group in these studies as opposed to a true lack of preventive benefit with STI treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>].

Despite several candidates, an effective HIV vaccine has yet to be developed. One vaccine tested in Thailand demonstrated some short-lived protection from HIV, which was ascribed to antibody dependent cytotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].

Biomedical interventions (such as the antiretroviral-based strategies of treatment as prevention and pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, as well as voluntary medical circumcision for uninfected heterosexual males) are proven and highly effective in reducing HIV infection. Nevertheless, behavioral interventions (such as condom use and risk-reduction counseling) remain crucial elements of prevention, and most studies of biomedical interventions included continued emphasis on behavioral modification. While no single behavioral intervention is perfectly effective, in aggregate, it is believed that such interventions have reduced the spread of HIV in some populations. The magnitude of the epidemic without such interventions cannot be predicted.</p><p>Accordingly, the following section discusses how certain aspects of biomedical and behavioral interventions are combined for a patient-specific approach. This discussion is generally consistent with recommendations on HIV prevention from multiple expert organizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/127-129\" class=\"abstract_t\">127-129</a>].

Thus, ART is a key strategy to curb the spread of HIV. (See <a href=\"#H525607733\" class=\"local\">'Treatment as prevention (TaSP)'</a> above.)</p><p>In the United States, ART initiation is recommended for all HIV-infected patients, regardless of CD4 cell count, to decrease AIDS and non-AIDS associated morbidities and mortalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/127,131\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,131</a>]. Prevention of HIV transmission is an additional rationale for the more widespread use of ART. For resource-limited settings, the World Health Organization (WHO) has also recommended ART initiation for all HIV-infected patients, regardless of CD4 cell count or clinical stage, given the mounting evidence of the clinical benefit of ART, even at high CD4 cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/132,133\" class=\"abstract_t\">132,133</a>], and the reduction in the risk of transmission to uninfected partners with successful ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].

Treatment success also relies on patient adherence to medication, which can be facilitated by reductions in pill burden, looser dosing frequency, and ongoing counseling to assess and encourage ART adherence. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1946815802\"><span class=\"h3\">Counseling on condom use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All HIV-infected patients who are not on stable ART should use condoms to reduce the risk of sexual transmission. For HIV-infected individuals with durable viral suppression on ART, the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner is negligible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/13,67,134\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,67,134</a>]. Nevertheless, we counsel such patients that consistent condom use remains prudent for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although &quot;negligible,&quot; the risk of sexual transmission from a virally suppressed individual cannot be completely ruled out. Most trials of HIV &quot;treatment as prevention&quot; in heterosexual discordant couples included condoms in the prevention package so the benefits of ART could not be disaggregated from the potential benefit(s) of condoms. (See <a href=\"#H525607733\" class=\"local\">'Treatment as prevention (TaSP)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subsequent studies have evaluated the risk of sexual transmission in the absence of condom use. In a prospective observational study of serodiscordant (548 heterosexual and 340 MSM) couples who chose not to use condoms and among whom the HIV-infected partner was virally suppressed on ART (&lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL),</span> there were no documented intra-couple transmission events after more than 1200 couple-years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One heterosexual and ten MSM partners acquired HIV infection during the study period, but viral sequence analysis suggested that these infections were not transmitted from the long-term HIV-infected partner. However, the potential for intra-couple HIV transmission risk could not be completely ruled out by this study (95% CI 0-0.30 for any sex and 0-0.71 for anal sex). Furthermore, there was some uncertainty as to whether the sequencing analysis in this study could completely rule out linked infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condoms effectively protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which are common among HIV-infected individuals, regardless of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condoms offer protection from HIV transmission in case the HIV-infected partner has loss of virologic suppression.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355159304\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine assessment of ongoing risk behavior should be performed, and counseling on reducing those risks should be individualized. </p><p>For injection drug users, addiction treatment (eg, with opioid substitution or with buprenorphine-naltrexone) and participation in needle exchange programs, if available, are additional useful strategies to decrease risk behavior and, likely, HIV transmission.

For all modes of transmission, a higher viral load in the HIV-infected source individual is associated with a greater risk of transmission. (See <a href=\"#H525605851\" class=\"local\">'Modes of acquisition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H525606004\" class=\"local\">'Viremia in the source individual'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of sexual transmission of HIV varies widely depending on the type of exposure. In general, exposures that lead to mucosal disruption and bleeding are associated with higher risk than other exposures. Unprotected anal sex conveys the greatest probability of HIV transmission and oral sex the lowest. Lack of circumcision is associated with HIV acquisition in men, and concurrent sexually transmitted infections are associated with both transmission and acquisition. Other behavioral factors, such as whether condoms were used, the number of sexual partners, and sex under the influence of recreational drugs, also affect overall sexual HIV transmission risk.
