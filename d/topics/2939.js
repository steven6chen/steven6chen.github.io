The acute illness is self-limited and is characterized by high fever, nonexudative conjunctivitis, inflammation of the oral mucosa, rash, cervical adenopathy, and findings in the extremities, including swollen hands and feet, red palms and soles, and, later, subungual peeling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-epidemiology-and-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children with KD are at risk for serious cardiovascular sequelae, particularly coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs), which can lead to myocardial ischemia, infarction, and sudden death. The risk of developing CAAs is highest among children with KD who are not treated early in the disease with high-dose intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG). Thus, initial management of patients with KD is focused on early diagnosis and treatment with IVIG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features and evaluation of cardiac sequelae of KD, including CAA, will be reviewed here.

In these studies, early KD is manifested as a panarteritis without fibrinoid necrosis. Infiltration of inflammatory cells (ie, neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells) leads to dissociation and disruption of the media and internal elastic lamina. Studies using immunohistochemical techniques demonstrate that neutrophil infiltration in the coronary arterial wall peaks prior to infiltrations of CD68+ <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages,</span> CD3+ lymphocytes, and CD20+ lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Aneurysms occur primarily in the coronary arteries. However, patients with giant coronary aneurysms sometimes also have peripheral aneurysms in extraparenchymal, medium-sized muscular arteries, such as the axillary, brachial, iliac, or femoral arteries.</p><p>In addition to coronary arteritis, cardiac involvement during the acute phase of KD includes inflammation in the pericardium, myocardium, atrioventricular conduction system, heart valves, and endocardium. Fulminant myocarditis and arrhythmias were reported to cause early deaths among the initial reported case series of KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition to data from autopsy series, which are skewed to the most severe cases, right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies have suggested that myocarditis is common, with late persistence of myocyte hypertrophy, disarray, and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Autopsy studies from the 1990s and 2000s of deaths occurring one month after onset of disease (ie, convalescent phase) described progressive neointimal proliferation, neoangiogenesis, and fibrosis with scar formation, whereas autopsies among patients who died several years later after the diagnosis of KD typically show severe coronary artery stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The late coronary artery histology among patients with aneurysms is characterized by replacement of medial smooth muscle with fibroblasts and extracellular matrix, and destruction of the internal elastic lamina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Growth factors are expressed at areas of high sheer stress, such as the inlet and outlet of aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In a subsequent report of an autopsy series of patients with coronary aneurysms, three pathologic processes were observed: necrotizing arteritis (mediated by neutrophils), <span class=\"nowrap\">subacute/chronic</span> vasculitis (mediated by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils), and luminal myofibroblastic proliferation, which can promote coronary artery stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast to earlier studies, this report found complete absence of atherosclerotic changes within coronary aneurysms.</p><p>The late histopathology in KD differs from that described in routine adult atherosclerotic heart disease. As a result, the natural history and responses to coronary interventions in KD cannot be directly extrapolated from the large adult coronary literature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13231724\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3838556724\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common cardiovascular symptoms during the acute phase include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachycardia out of proportion to the degree of fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperdynamic precordium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallop rhythm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104786\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104786 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Murmurs &ndash; Innocent flow murmurs are common in children with KD resulting from fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anemia at the time of presentation.

Mitral regurgitation in acute KD generally results from valvulitis, whereas late mitral regurgitation is more likely to reflect papillary muscle dysfunction associated with ischemic heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H242698055\" class=\"local\">'Valvular regurgitation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Infrequently, patients may present with KD shock syndrome, most often characterized by warm shock with low peripheral vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The differential diagnosis in such patients includes toxic shock syndrome, sepsis, and for those with severe myocardial dysfunction, viral-induced acute fulminant myocarditis. Rarely, KD can present with hemophagocytic syndrome or macrophage activation syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].

Some have cold, pale, or cyanotic digits of the hands and feet with reduced blood perfusion. Peripheral gangrene may, in rare cases, cause loss of fingers or toes during this acute period.

Late cardiac manifestations may include symptoms of myocardial ischemia (eg, chest pain, abdominal pain, pallor, diaphoresis, or inconsolable crying without an obvious cause) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of arrhythmia (eg, syncope, palpitations). These symptoms warrant prompt evaluation. However, more than one-third of patients with myocardial infarction were asymptomatic in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Children without coronary dilation or aneurysms during the acute or subacute phase are extremely unlikely to have ischemia or other late cardiac manifestations.

In one report based upon national surveillance data from 1994 to 2003 that included 3115 children with KD, Asian and Pacific Islander race and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with an increased risk of CAAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In an analysis from the Pediatric Health Information System that identified 4811 patients with KD from 2001 to 2006, the highest rate of CAAs was reported in American Indians, but the number of such patients with KD was small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The second highest rate of CAAs was in Hispanics (5.9 percent), followed by white non-Hispanic patients (3.4 percent), and the lowest rates were seen in black and Asian patients (1.8 percent in both groups).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86333728\"><span class=\"h3\">Natural course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural course of CAAs is determined in large part by the severity of coronary artery disease during the acute phase of KD. Aneurysms may increase in size over the first four to six weeks after illness onset. After reaching a peak diameter, approximately 50 to 75 percent of aneurysms regress to normal lumen diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. Regression generally occurs within two years after the initial onset of KD; after this time, further regression is unlikely. The likelihood that an aneurysm will regress to normal lumen diameter is most strongly related to its maximum diameter; giant aneurysms are least likely to regress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/46,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48,49</a>]. Aneurysms are also more likely to regress in younger children, at a more distal location, or if they are fusiform in shape [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Although internal lumen diameter is normal in regressed aneurysmal segments, myointimal thickening is evident by late intravascular ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>] and is directly related to the initial coronary diameter during the early months after disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Multiple studies have also demonstrated impaired coronary and peripheral vascular reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>].</p><p>In patients with persistent aneurysms, myointimal proliferation at the aneurysm entrance or exit progresses steadily over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/44,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,56,57</a>]. Approximately half of aneurysms of maximum diameter &ge;6 mm developed stenosis by 15 years follow-up in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Aneurysmal arterial segments are also prone to increased tortuosity, calcification, and thrombotic occlusion. Because the arterial wall calcifies over time, the very rare event of aneurysm rupture is generally confined to the earliest months after illness onset.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H242697570\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence of mild to moderate ventricular dysfunction is noted on echocardiography during the acute phase in one-quarter to one-half of patients with KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Rarely, function is severely depressed. Depressed myocardial contractility may be caused by direct myocardial inflammation (ie, myocarditis) or from indirect negative inotropic effects of the systemic inflammatory response; whereas ischemic cardiomyopathy may occur in patients after myocardial infarction. Depressed ventricular function during the acute phase is often manifested by a third heart sound gallop, which may become more prominent with hydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In rare cases, it may progress to heart failure. For patients without ischemic cardiomyopathy, ventricular function usually improves rapidly following treatment with IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>In a study of 198 patients with KD, echocardiographic evaluation demonstrated left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in 20 percent of patients at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Myocardial function generally improved rapidly after IVIG administration, and systolic function normalized among patients without ischemic myocardial disease. However, patients with LV dysfunction were more likely to have coronary artery dilation one and five weeks after diagnosis.</p><p>The LV dysfunction is due to impairment of both load-dependent and load-independent measures of LV contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Anesthesia is needed to perform both types of noninvasive angiography when children are unable to stay still. CTA exposes children to ionizing radiation. Although the radiation dosages are ever decreasing, this is still a risk in children who require repeated studies. However, the quality of coronary imaging is generally superior to that of cardiac MRA. Nonetheless, MRA has several advantages over ultrafast CTA, because it can be combined with dobutamine- or adenosine-stress testing, and can also delineate the territory affected by myocardial infarction using delayed enhancement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H242698454\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrocardiogram (ECG) may show arrhythmia, slight prolongation of the PR and QT intervals, or nonspecific ST and T wave changes. In patients with aneurysms, myocardial infarction can be indicated by ECG abnormalities, supported by elevation in biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis (eg, troponin, creatinine kinase MB dimers [CK-MB]) and myocardial imaging studies showing new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13231752\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress testing for inducible ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with aneurysms are advised to undergo periodic testing for inducible ischemia in order to detect and, if present, to quantify the degree of coronary insufficiency. The interval for testing is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-management-and-prognosis#H993151950\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Frequency of follow-up'</a>.)</p><p>Only small case series have reported the results of stress testing in children with KD and aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/113-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-124</a>]. Thus, the choice of testing technique is based upon the larger adult literature, the ability of a child to cooperate, potential risks (such as radiation exposure or anesthesia), and the institutional experience. Because the risk of false-positive testing is highest when the probability of disease is low, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend stress testing in patients without a history of aneurysms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In determining the most appropriate stress test to detect ischemia in children with CAAs, the following should be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise stress testing is preferred to pharmacologic stress testing because it is more physiologic. However, if children are unable to cooperate with the exercise protocol, pharmacological stress testing using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> MRA avoids radiation exposure and can assess both perfusion and wall motion abnormalities. This testing is usually done under anesthesia. Pediatric experience with pharmacologic stress testing using positron emission tomography is growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise testing for inducible ischemia with only ECG monitoring for ischemic changes has a relatively low mean sensitivity and specificity in adult series.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The predictive value of exercise stress testing is enhanced with the use of noninvasive imaging. In weighing the relative merits of imaging techniques, stress echocardiography compared with SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) perfusion imaging has a higher success rate, greater specificity, and avoids radiation exposure and the need for placement of an intravenous line; the latter is a major advantage for younger children. However, stress echocardiography is dependent upon acoustic windows, and, compared with SPECT imaging, has greater interobserver variability and lower sensitivity. For patients with KD with left main or multivessel disease leading to &quot;balanced ischemia,&quot; SPECT imaging may be less sensitive than stress echocardiography.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13231759\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because cardiac catheterization with angiography has a greater risk than noninvasive methods and exposes children to ionizing radiation, it should be restricted to patients with clinically significant CAAs in whom:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive testing cannot provide equivalent imaging without greater risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms or noninvasive evidence of ischemia suggest that coronary revascularization may be indicated.

Because aneurysms in KD may evolve and regress over time, we generally recommend cardiac catheterization or coronary CTA in patients with large or complex aneurysms approximately 12 months after illness onset. Cardiac catheterization is performed earlier if there are clinical or noninvasive induced signs of ischemia.</p><p>Selective coronary angiography has historically been the &quot;gold standard&quot; for evaluation of coronary architecture in children with KD. In fact, serial angiography in Japanese patients has defined the natural history of the disease. Coronary angiography offers detailed definition of the coronary lumen anatomy and blood flow characteristics, including collateral flow. It can detect and quantify stenosis, obstruction, and aneurysms of the coronary arteries and the collateral circulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65317\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef65317 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53864\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef53864 \">movie 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76878\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76878 \">movie 5</a>). Intraluminal ultrasound performed at the time of cardiac catheterization can add information about the structure of the coronary arterial wall, and measurements of coronary flow reserve with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> stress may also be useful.

Patients also can develop depressed ventricular function in the acute phase, valvular regurgitation, pericardial effusion, and peripheral artery aneurysms. Late cardiovascular complications include progressive coronary artery stenosis or occlusion, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias. These are generally limited to patients who had CAAs in the acute phase. (See <a href=\"#H242696497\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aneurysms typically increase over the first four to six weeks after illness onset, and approximately 50 percent regress to normal lumen diameter over the subsequent two years. The likelihood that an aneurysm will regress to normal lumen diameter is most strongly related to its maximum diameter; giant aneurysms are least likely to regress. The highest risk of morbidity and mortality is associated with large or giant CAAs. (See <a href=\"#H86333728\" class=\"local\">'Natural course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CAAs are considered to be at risk for early atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. The thresholds for treatment of risk factors for adult atherosclerotic heart disease are lower in such patients than in the general population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54963\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54963 \">algorithm 1</a>). Patients who never had CAAs do not appear to be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease compared with the general pediatric population. (See <a href=\"#H612020757\" class=\"local\">'Accelerated atherosclerosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all patients with KD, cardiac testing includes electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography (see <a href=\"#H242696505\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The ECG may show arrhythmia, slight prolongation of the PR and QT intervals, or nonspecific ST and T wave changes.

Echocardiography also detects other noncoronary artery abnormalities including depressed myocardial contractility, valvular lesions, and pericardial effusions. When echocardiography is inadequate to image the coronary arteries, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is used to fully delineate the coronary arterial tree.
