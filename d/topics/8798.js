class=\"h1\">THE ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of symptoms, management decisions and the indications for surgery rest largely upon the echocardiographic assessment of LV size and function as well as careful confirmation of the severity of MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Some degree of LV and left atrial enlargement are to be expected in severe chronic MR; thus, chamber enlargement alone is generally not an indication for surgery in patients with severe chronic MR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71650 \">table 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98397\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98397 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Some consideration of body size should be included in any estimation of LV dimension, since smaller women are less likely to reach the above criteria, which were largely established in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, simply normalizing for body surface area can lead to misleading conclusions, especially in obese patients. In general, somewhat lower values should be used in very small patients and somewhat higher values in very large patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal left ventricular function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic patients with severe chronic MR and normal LV systolic function (defined as LV ejection fraction [LVEF] &ge;60 percent and LV end-systolic dimension &lt;40 mm) are usually followed and managed conservatively. Such patients should be seen every 6 to 12 months or sooner if symptoms occur; repeat transthoracic echocardiography should be obtained at these visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of chronic primary mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>An occasional patient with a borderline LVEF or a technically limited study will require radionuclide, contrast angiography, or cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to assess LV function and regurgitant fraction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests to evaluate left ventricular systolic function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Exercise stress testing may add objective evidence about symptoms and a change in exercise tolerance; it may be particularly useful if an adequate history of exercise capacity is difficult to obtain. Measurement of MR severity and pulmonary artery pressure during exercise may also be helpful.</p><p>Mitral valve surgery is reasonable in some asymptomatic patients with severe chronic MR and preserved LV systolic function, defined as an LVEF &gt;60 percent and an LV end-systolic dimension &lt;40 mm <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> or &lt;45 mm (ESC).

An ERO &ge;40 mm<sup>2</sup>, which was present in 43 percent of cases, was associated with a significant increase in regurgitant volume (101 versus 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/beat</span> with an ERO &lt;20 mm<sup>2</sup>) and was a powerful predictor of an adverse outcome, including all-cause mortality, cardiac events, and undergoing cardiac surgery. </p><p>Similarly, a prospective observational study of 447 asymptomatic patients with severe MR and normal LV function found that ERO, baseline grade of pulmonary hypertension, and age were independent predictors for development of an indication for MV surgery or heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>ERO use is subject to technical limitations and the ERO does not account for the duration of regurgitation (mid-late systolic versus holosystolic) while this is accounted for by the regurgitant volume and the regurgitant fraction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23030411\"><span class=\"h3\">Left atrial size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognostic significance of left atrial volume indexed to body surface area (LA index) was suggested by a prospective observational study of 492 patients with isolated primary MR (81 percent mitral valve prolapse) in sinus rhythm at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Five-year survival with medical management was 80 percent. LA index was an independent predictor of mortality and of cardiac events in patients receiving medical management. Patients with LA index &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> had lower five-year survival (53 percent) than those with LA index of 40 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> (84 percent) and those with LA index &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> (90 percent). LA index remained a significant predictor of mortality and cardiac events after adjustment by ERO.</p><p>In this cohort, mitral surgery was associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.46, 95% CI, 0.26-0.84) and cardiac events (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.62). Postoperative outcomes were not significantly different in patients with LA index &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> as compared with those with LA index &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</span> </sup>(five-year mortality 9.1 versus 8.7 percent and cardiovascular events 20 versus 16.8 percent). </p><p>These findings suggest that LA index may be a useful parameter for risk stratification of patients with MR although this study did not evaluate whether it provides predictive value beyond current monitored parameters such as pulmonary artery systolic pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Functional capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential value of quantitative assessment of functional capacity (FC) using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with determination of gas exchange was assessed in 134 asymptomatic patients with MR (57 percent severe) who underwent CPET and echocardiographic quantitation of MR (including the ERO), as well as measurement of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At three years, clinical events and the combined end point of clinical events and surgery were significantly more common in the 25 percent of patients with markedly reduced FC.

Some of these asymptomatic patients remain asymptomatic and stable for years but some develop irreversible LV systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Surgical decisions in asymptomatic patients with preserved LV function depend upon associated factors including the preferences of the patient. In this setting, surgery is suggested for patients with new onset atrial fibrillation (AF), pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure at rest &gt;50 mmHg), or high likelihood of successful mitral valve repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. </p><p>Serial clinical monitoring for symptoms and echocardiographic monitoring of LV size and systolic function (&quot;watchful waiting&quot;) are recommended for patients with severe MR who are treated medically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Any trend indicating a decline in LVEF below normal is an indication for surgery.</p><p>The safety of watchful waiting in asymptomatic patients with severe chronic MR who do not meet guideline recommendations for mitral valve surgery was evaluated in the following three observational series. The first study suggested that outcomes with watchful waiting may be acceptable, although no comparator group was available. The latter two studies suggested that early surgery may prolong survival and reduce onset of heart failure as compared with watchful waiting. However, residual confounding cannot be excluded and the early surgery approach is applicable only to centers with similarly high rates of successful mitral valve repair and low rates of operative mortality.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the earliest report, 132 consecutive patients (mean age 55 years) with degenerative disease (mitral valve prolapse or flail leaflet) were followed prospectively for development of an indication for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Criteria for surgery included symptoms, LV end-systolic diameter &ge;45 mm or 26 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/m<sup>2</sup></span> body surface area, LVEF &lt;60 percent or fractional shortening &lt;32 percent, systolic pulmonary artery pressure &gt;50 mmHg, or recurrent AF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>During a mean follow-up of 5.2 years, criteria for surgery were met in 38 patients (29 percent).

Because there is considerable variability in the accuracy of echocardiographic regurgitant severity, some of these patients may have hemodynamically severe disease. This issue is not directly addressed in major society guidelines.</p><p>In patients with &quot;moderate&quot; mitral regurgitation and symptoms, careful evaluation for other causes of symptoms, including pulmonary disease, should be the first step. If no other cause of symptoms is present, other evidence for adverse hemodynamic consequences of mitral regurgitation (suggesting regurgitation is in fact severe) should be evaluated. This evidence includes LV dilation or systolic dysfunction, the presence persistent or intermittent AF, or early pulmonary hypertension. When the likelihood of valve repair is high and the clinical evidence is consistent with symptoms due to mitral regurgitation, valve repair or replacement should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Measurement of LV volumes, regurgitation fraction and ejection fraction by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) also may be helpful in these patients for more accurate quantitation of regurgitation severity, ventricular size and function. A conservative nonsurgical approach is suggested for the patient with no or mild symptoms and moderate MR; careful clinical follow-up is indicated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">The patient with moderate to severe symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient presents with serious symptoms (NYHA functional class III or IV), (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 8</a>), surgery is almost always indicated unless there is severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF &le;30 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98397\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98397 \">table 4</a>). A valve repair procedure is preferable, regardless of the LVEF.</p><p>Delaying surgery until moderate to severe symptoms occur is associated with increased perioperative and long-term mortality. The potential magnitude of this effect was illustrated in a retrospective study that compared the outcome after surgery in 199 patients in NYHA class <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> with 279 patients in class <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Compared with those in class <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II,</span> patients in class <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> had a significantly higher surgical mortality (5.4 versus 0.5 percent) and a significantly lower 10-year survival (48 versus 76 percent). These differences were independent of all baseline characteristics, including LVEF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76172\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76172 \">figure 2</a>) and concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50964\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50964 \">figure 3</a>), and were seen in patients undergoing valve replacement or repair, although the outcomes were better with valve repair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56177\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56177 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>Patients with an LVEF below 30 percent are not likely to have an optimal result, especially if valve replacement is necessary. In such patients, medical management, including vasodilator therapy, may be preferable. In patients who do not respond to medical therapy, surgical intervention may be considered if the mitral annular-papillary muscle continuity can be maintained (which helps maintain LV systolic function) either by valve repair or replacement with perseveration of the chordal apparatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The six month interval is preferred if stability has not been documented, there is evidence of progression, or measurements are close to the echocardiographic cutoff values. A decision about watchful waiting must consider patient preference, the presence of other risk factors (new atrial fibrillation or pulmonary hypertension), and whether mitral valve repair, the preferred approach, can be performed. Surgery may be offered earlier in patients with borderline values in patients in whom access to such monitoring is limited.
