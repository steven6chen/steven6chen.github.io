These ablation techniques can be applied to the entire prostate gland or to only the part of the gland thought to be involved with cancer.</p><p>The role of ablation techniques as an alternative to radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy (RT) for the definitive treatment of prostate cancer remains uncertain. Potential advantages in men with localized disease include the ability to destroy cancer cells using a relatively noninvasive procedure, as well as sparing normal tissue. These procedures are associated with minimal blood loss and less pain than surgery, and there is a more rapid posttreatment convalescence.</p><p>Whether the long-term outcomes are equivalent to those with definitive surgery or RT is uncertain, however. Additional experience and longer follow-up are required to compare the rate of disease control and side effects profiles with other treatment modalities.</p><p>The role of ablative techniques for the initial treatment of localized prostate cancer as well as its use in the salvage setting is discussed here. Standard treatment options for early prostate cancer and the approach to patients with local recurrence after RT are discussed separately.

Potential advantages of cryoablation compared with other therapeutic options in men with localized prostate cancer include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability to destroy cancer cells using a relatively noninvasive procedure. Cryotherapy is associated with minimal blood loss and pain, is much better tolerated than an open radical prostatectomy, and has a more rapid posttreatment convalescence. These differences may be less pronounced compared with minimally invasive (robotic or laparoscopic) prostatectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryotherapy can be performed under spinal rather than general anesthesia and therefore can be offered to men who are not candidates for surgery because of advanced age or comorbidities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryotherapy can be used to treat men with localized disease or locally recurrent cancer following initial radiation therapy (RT). Cryoablation can be performed more than once; if necessary, it can be followed by either RT or radical prostatectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Salvage local therapy&quot;, section on 'Cryotherapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In early studies, cryotherapy was associated with unacceptably high complication rates, and it was largely abandoned. Improvements in tumor demarcation, instrumentation, and treatment delivery systems have led to a resurgence of interest in cryotherapy to treat prostate cancer.</p><p>One of the major advances facilitating the use of prostate cryotherapy was the application of high-precision transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging. Using this approach, the extent of freezing can be precisely controlled and tissue destruction is monitored with real-time visualization of the prostate and surrounding structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, &quot;third generation&quot; systems for prostate cryotherapy use smaller cryoprobes that are placed via a percutaneous transperineal approach with a brachytherapy template. Argon, rather than liquid nitrogen, is used to facilitate rapid freezing using ultrathin probes. Helium gas is used to actively thaw the prostate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Biology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biology underlying tissue injury by freezing is complex and incompletely understood. During cryotherapy, argon or helium gas is used to cool the cryoprobes that have been inserted into the prostate, thus rapidly extracting heat from the gland. This cooling facilitates rapid development of ice crystals in the extracellular compartment with freezing of intracellular water, resulting in cell death.</p><p>The rapid development of intracellular ice crystals produces shearing and rupture of cell membranes, organelles, and the cytoskeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Tissue damage also occurs because ice crystallization extracts free water from the intracellular solutes, resulting in protein denaturation. These complex mechanisms of cell death are further enhanced by damage to the microvascular circulation, which results in secondary anoxia and hemorrhagic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These mechanisms of cellular injury have been well described in tissue rapidly frozen to -40&ordm;C once or to -10&ordm;C twice.</p><p>The two parameters that correlate best with the magnitude of cell destruction are the lowest temperature achieved and the rate of cooling during freezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cell death requires temperatures lower than -20&ordm;C, but temperatures as low as -40&ordm;C may be necessary to ensure complete freezing of the intracellular compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This fact has important implications for the urologist performing the procedure. The hyperechoic visualized edge of the ice ball as seen on TRUS has a temperature of 0 to -2&ordm;C, while temperatures are as low as -20 to -40&ordm;C inside this edge. Thus, the ice ball must extend beyond the edge of the prostatic tumor to ensure adequate tissue ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Rapid freezing is crucial to ensure cell destruction because with time, cells initiate fluid shifts, becoming relatively hyperosmolar and cryoresistant. Because rapid freezing is associated with minimal loss of intracellular water, it is associated with a maximal chance of intracellular ice formation. Passive warming, which occurs over 15 to 20 minutes after the cryoprobes are allowed to thaw, results in the formation of larger ice crystals (termed recrystallization), which results in further tissue destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>After one episode of freezing, the cells are highly vulnerable to additional hypothermic injury with a second freeze-thaw cycle, resulting in the destruction of many of the previously surviving cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The increased effectiveness of the &quot;double freeze-thaw&quot; technique appears to occur without appreciably higher rates of side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85226595\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioperative preparation consists of a Fleet enema prior to the procedure. Crossmatching of blood is unnecessary. Prophylactic antibiotics are given intravenously on the day of surgery, and in our practice we use an oral fluoroquinolone for prophylaxis for one week following cryotherapy.</p><p>Cryotherapy can be performed under either regional or general anesthesia with the patient placed in the lithotomy position. Careful cystoscopic inspection of the urethra, bladder, prostate, and ureteral orifices should be accomplished at the beginning of the procedure. Urethral and suprapubic catheters are placed to permit a continuous flow of warm irrigant through the urethra to protect its mucosa from freezing and sloughing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>].</p><p>The freezing of the prostate is carried out using multiple cryoprobes that are placed approximately 1 cm apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Using high-precision TRUS imaging, these probes are placed within the prostatic tumor via a percutaneous transperineal approach. Generally, two probes are placed anteromedially, two posterolaterally, and one posteriorly, although in one series, the use of six to eight cryoprobes appeared to provide better glandular ablation compared with the five probe technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Modern or &quot;third generation&quot; techniques employ a higher number of ultrathin needles which are inserted through a brachytherapy template [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Multiple thermocouples are distributed both within the gland and outside the gland to measure temperature during the procedure.</p><p>After the cryoprobes and thermocouples are in place, argon or helium gas is used to cool the cryoprobes, creating freezing temperatures in the gland and destroying the exposed tissue. The extent of freezing is precisely controlled and tissue destruction is monitored using real-time visualization of the prostate and surrounding structures by TRUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When the ice ball has reached the posterior aspect of the prostate capsule, argon gas is used to actively thaw the prostate. Two freeze-thaw cycles are generally administered in order to optimize cell killing.</p><p>Following therapy, the majority of patients are discharged home with a urethral catheter in place for at least two weeks. This appears to be associated with a lower likelihood of urethral sloughing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urinary retention compared with the use of a suprapubic catheter or with shorter periods of urethral catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard approaches to the management of men with localized prostate cancer include radical prostatectomy, RT (external beam <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> brachytherapy), and active surveillance.

Patients received three to six months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) prior to RT or cryotherapy. Treatment failure was based upon a rising serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), radiologic evidence of disease progression, or the need for further treatment. Using the Phoenix criteria to define PSA progression, treatment failure was observed in 24 percent of each treatment group at 36 months. At 36 months there was a higher incidence of positive biopsies in patients treated with RT (29 versus 8 percent), but the significance of a positive biopsy following RT is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'After radiation therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of prostate biopsy&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a smaller trial conducted between 1999 and 2002, 63 men with T2c or T3 prostate cancer received neoadjuvant ADT and were then randomly assigned to RT or cryotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. With a median follow-up of 105 months, the eight-year biochemical disease-free survival was significantly longer for RT compared with cryotherapy (59 versus 17 percent). There was no significant difference in disease-specific or overall survival.</p><p/><p>Cryotherapy was compared with low dose rate brachytherapy in a retrospective series of 359 men with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Cryotherapy was less efficacious based upon five-year biochemical progression-free survival using a criterion for failure of PSA nadir +2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the study patients were treated over a 22 year period, and significant biases associated with patient selection, the use of ADT, and changes in diagnosis, treatment, and imaging techniques may have affected patient outcomes.</p><p>Factors limiting the interpretation of these data include the relatively short follow-up and the lack of accepted criteria to define biochemical treatment failure after treatment with cryotherapy. In addition, the doses of radiation used in both trials with external beam RT were low by contemporary standards (114 of 119 patients receiving &le;70 Gy in one trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and all patients were treated with 66 Gy in the other trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Dose and schedule'</a>.)</p><p>Multiple observational series have also reported on outcomes when cryotherapy is used as the primary therapy to ablate the whole prostate gland for localized prostate cancer. Interpretation of these results is hampered by the lack of uniform tumor staging and grading, variable follow-up duration, and inconsistencies in the use of neoadjuvant androgen ablation. Posttreatment biopsies of the primary tumor have been the used to evaluate local tumor control, but the absence of a rise in the posttreatment serum PSA is increasingly accepted as a surrogate endpoint. Cryotherapy does not result in complete ablation of all prostatic tissue. As such, defining the specific value of posttreatment serum PSA which best predicts treatment outcome is difficult.</p><p>The most extensive data with the longest follow-up on cryotherapy to the whole prostate gland to treat localized prostate cancer come from the COLD (Cryo-On-Line Data) registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This database is supported and maintained by the manufacturers of the cryotherapy equipment, but the data are maintained by an entirely separate company to maintain scientific integrity.</p><p>A report from this registry incorporated pre- and posttreatment information from 1198 patients. The mean follow-up was two years, and 11 percent of men were followed for five years or more. Biochemical disease-free survival was assessed using both the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) criteria and the Phoenix revision of those criteria, although both were developed for patients managed with RT rather than cryotherapy. The five-year rates of biochemical disease-free survival for the entire data set were 77 and 73 percent, using these two sets of criteria. Based upon risk of relapse, the five-year biochemical disease-free survival rates according to the ASTRO and Phoenix criteria were 85, 73, and 75 percent and 91, 78, and 62 percent, respectively, for low, intermediate, and high-risk patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'After radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In a study of 1111 men in the COLD registry, a nadir PSA &lt;0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> correlated with five-year progression-free survival rates of 90, 81, and 74 percent in low, intermediate, and high-risk prostate cancer, respectively. In contrast, the 24 month biochemical failure rates were 29, 46, and 49 percent for low, intermediate, and high-risk cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In the COLD registry, results were reported for posttreatment prostate biopsies in 326 cases. When there was no specific indication for a biopsy, 30 of 207 (14 percent) were positive, while 49 of 129 (38 percent) were positive among those in whom there was a suspicion of residual or recurrent disease.</p><p>Those who have positive posttreatment biopsies following cryotherapy may be eligible for further treatment that has the potential to render them pathologically free of disease (pT0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. This was illustrated in a series of 76 men undergoing primary prostate cryoablation, in which 10 of 73 assessable patients had positive postcryotherapy biopsies. After repeated treatment, all 10 had negative biopsy results, although two required further treatment.</p><p>The term therapeutic &quot;bifecta&quot; has been defined as a measure of the ability of a salvage therapy to achieve a post-treatment nadir PSA &lt;0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and preserving urinary control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The therapeutic &quot;bifecta&quot; serves as a surrogate benchmark to assess the impact of salvage therapies on a patient&rsquo;s quality of life in addition to enabling a direct comparison of various local salvage therapy modalities. Within the COLD registry, a therapeutic &quot;bifecta&quot; rate of 73 percent was observed in a cohort of 183 patients undergoing prostate cancer salvage cryotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85226857\"><span class=\"h3\">Focal cryotherapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85227619\"><span class=\"h4\">Rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ablation techniques have been advocated as a way to target only those areas of the prostate that harbor tumor, rather than the entire gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Based upon this rationale, normal segments of the gland and the neurovascular bundles can be preserved in most cases. Thus, focal therapy may avoid some of the complications of radical prostatectomy or RT.</p><p>Focal therapy assumes that the prostate cancer can be localized to a defined region in the prostate gland and that limited treatment can eradicate disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patient selection for this approach has been based upon extended biopsy schemes to define the area of the gland that is involved with tumor. However, pathologic involvement as defined in the radical prostatectomy specimen is often substantially more extensive than what had been predicted.</p><p>The frequency of multifocal, bilateral disease is illustrated by a series of 100 consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens examined histologically with serial sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Based upon the preoperative evaluation, all cases had favorable prognosis disease limited to one side of the prostate gland (less than three positive cores, &le;50 percent involvement of any core, and Gleason score &le;6). Despite these favorable preoperative parameters, 65 cases had contralateral involvement, as discrete nodules <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tumor crossing the midline from the side with known involvement. In six cases, the contralateral tumor had a Gleason score of 7. Similar results have been seen in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/25,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29-31</a>], emphasizing the need for careful patient selection based on estimated life expectancy and a thorough pretreatment biopsy scheme.</p><p>For those patients with higher volume or multifocal cancer, more complete ablation of the prostate corresponding to tumor location can be performed.

Focal cryotherapy can also be limited to the specific <span class=\"nowrap\">region/location</span> of the previously positive prostatic biopsy in those with a single positive core for cancer.</p><p>A report from the COLD registry identified 1160 patients who had been treated with focal cryotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The safety profile appeared favorable. However, further experience and longer follow-up are needed to define the role of focal cryotherapy in men with localized prostate cancer. At this time, patients best suited for such focal therapy include those with low-risk features (pretreatment serum PSA &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> Gleason grade &lt;6, and clinical stage T2a or lower) and unilateral disease.</p><p>Patients who are treated with focal cryotherapy will continue to have a detectable serum PSA since the entire prostate has not been treated. A rising PSA following focal cryotherapy is most often related to persistent localized disease (either a new focus of cancer or incomplete destruction of the original focus) and should promptly repeat prostate biopsy of both sides of the gland. If the biopsy is positive, men may be candidates for repeat cryotherapy or external beam RT as second-line treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85227821\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryotherapy for rising PSA after RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of cryotherapy in the management of patients with a rising serum PSA after definitive RT for localized prostate cancer is discussed separately.

In this approach, a photodynamic sensitizer, padeliporfin, is administered intravenously. This agent is then activated by near-infrared laser light to nitric oxide, resulting in localized blood vessel destruction. The infrared laser light is directed to the tissue by optical fibers inserted into the region of the prostate to be ablated.</p><p>This approach was compared with active surveillance in a randomized, open-label phase III trial in which 413 men were randomly assigned to photodynamic therapy or active surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryotherapy-and-other-ablative-techniques-for-the-initial-treatment-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. At a median follow-up of 24 months, significantly fewer patients had progressed to medium- or high-risk disease in the photodynamic therapy group (28 versus 58 percent, hazard ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.24-0.46). In addition, more men treated with photodynamic therapy had a negative biopsy at 24 months compared with those on active surveillance (49 versus 14 percent, adjusted risk ratio 3.67, 95% CI 2.53-5.33). Treatment was well tolerated.</p><p>Longer follow-up and comparisons with other treatment modalities will be required to assess the role of this approach in men with prostate cancer.
