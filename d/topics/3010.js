These bacteria don't make the cat sick. But you can get the disease if you are scratched or bitten by an infected cat or flea.</p><p>The infection causes redness, swelling, and small round bumps near the bite or scratch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83493\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83493 \">picture 1</a>). It also causes swollen &quot;lymph nodes.&quot; Lymph nodes are bean-shaped organs found all over the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63854\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63854 \">figure 1</a>). They make and store cells that fight infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109282241\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of cat scratch disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin redness and swelling that happens 3 to 10 days after a cat bite or scratch (or cat flea bite)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen lymph nodes, especially around the head, neck, and arms</p><p/><p>Other possible symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not feeling hungry</p><p/><p>In rare cases, cat scratch disease can cause more serious problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109282256\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If you have symptoms of cat scratch disease, your doctor might order a blood test to see if you have it.</p><p>In some cases, a doctor might do a lymph node biopsy. He or she will remove the node or a small sample of tissue from the node. Then another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109282271\"><span class=\"h1\">How is cat scratch disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although symptoms of cat scratch disease usually goes away without treatment, doctors often prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109282286\"><span class=\"h1\">Can cat scratch disease be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can lower your chances of getting cat scratch disease if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid playing or handling cats in ways that might lead to a bite or scratch.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands after playing with cats.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat cats for fleas, if needed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash cat bites or scratches right away with running water and soap.</p><p/><p>If you have a medical condition that it makes it hard for you to fight infection, such as HIV, you should avoid cats younger than a year old.
