However, the use of reperfusion therapies, including percutaneous coronary intervention or fibrinolysis, has significantly reduced the risk. LV thrombus can lead to arterial embolic complications such as stroke. Patients found to have an LV thrombus, or those at high risk, should receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> anticoagulation for at least three months.</p><p>This topic will discuss LV thrombus in detail. Other potential causes of arterial emboli originating in the heart are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention for specific causes of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Cardiogenic embolism'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia#H3749981443\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia&quot;, section on 'Arterial embolism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3248365798\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left ventricular (LV) thrombus is most often seen in patients with large anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction with anteroapical aneurysm formation. In most cases, these infarcts occur in the distribution of the left anterior descending coronary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These anteroapical infarcts have large areas of poorly contracting LV muscle; adjacent intracavitary blood movement is sluggish (stasis) compared with normal areas. This relative stasis of blood is thought to increase the risk of thrombus formation. Many, but not all, of these patients will have an LV apical aneurysm with akinesis or dyskinesis. In most cases, thrombus is located within or adjacent to the LV apex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] but can also occur with large inferolateral <span class=\"nowrap\">infarctions/aneurysms</span>. Contact of blood with the fibrous tissue in the aneurysm rather than normal endocardium is also thought to trigger clot formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-ventricular-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm-following-acute-myocardial-infarction#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left ventricular aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm following acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Systemic embolization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3601743910\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH-RISK PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the pathophysiology of the development of left ventricular (LV) thrombus, the following are clinical risk factors for the development of LV thrombus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction by electrocardiographic criteria.

Most, but not all, of these patients will have an LV aneurysm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-ventricular-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm-following-acute-myocardial-infarction#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left ventricular aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm following acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Left ventricular aneurysm'</a>.)</p><p/><p>These three factors are more potent risk predictors in patients who do not undergo reperfusion than in those who do. In general, patients who are reperfused have smaller infarcts than those who are not. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed very early after the anterior infarction may show an EF &lt;30 percent; however, repeat TTE 48 hours after reperfusion may show significant improvement in LV systolic function. (See <a href=\"#H141352237\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> below.) </p><p>Also, patients with long delays between onset of symptoms and reperfusion (perhaps four to six hours or longer) are at increased risk for an LV aneurysm due to more extensive <span class=\"nowrap\">infarction/systolic</span> dysfunction. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141352237\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the past 30 years, the incidence of left ventricular (LV) thrombus has decreased as the frequency of primary reperfusion with either fibrinolysis or primary percutaneous coronary intervention has increased. The likely mechanism is that reperfusion, compared with no reperfusion, leads to smaller infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-12</a>]. Its impact may be greatest in patients with anterior infarctions, which tend to be larger than infarcts at other locations. (See <a href=\"#H3248365798\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>The incidence of LV thrombi in the pre-reperfusion era was reported to be as high as 40 percent in patients with anterior infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. Most thrombi developed within the first two weeks (median five to six days) after myocardial infarction (MI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3,4,7,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7,10,11</a>]. In a series of 30 patients with LV thrombus after an acute anterior MI, 27 percent were present at less than 24 hours, 57 percent at 48 to 72 hours, 75 percent at one week, and 96 percent at two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Data are more limited on the incidence of LV thrombus in the reperfusion era in which most patients receive either primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolysis for ST-elevation MI (STEMI). In two series of STEMI patients treated with primary PCI, the incidence of LV thrombus was about 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>However, the true incidence of LV thrombus in the current reperfusion era may be higher than in the above studies, as reported incidence depends on the sensitivity of the diagnostic test used. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with late gadolinium enhancement has been shown to be considerably better than transthoracic echocardiography with or without an intravenous endocardial border definition contrast agent contrast. In a study of 201 STEMI patients, of whom 199 were treated with reperfusion, who were evaluated with late gadolinium enhancement CMR, the incidence of LV thrombus was 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Finally, some of these studies may have underestimated the true incidence, as patients at high risk for LV thrombus (severe heart failure and systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg) were excluded. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) should undergo (noncontrast) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to assess left ventricular (LV) function before discharge with specific evaluation of apical function, aneurysm, and the presence of an LV thrombus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F116123\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116123 \">algorithm 1</a>). In most patients with LV thrombus, the diagnosis will be made using TTE rather than another modality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F109717\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109717 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F109718\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef109718 \">movie 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3601743910\" class=\"local\">'High-risk patients'</a> above.)</p><p>When the sonographer is screening for LV thrombus, particular attention should be paid to the LV apex (or for any aneurysm or dyskinetic segment). In addition to reporting the presence of an aneurysm and wall motion in that region, the presence or absence of thrombus should be noted. TTE characteristics of LV thrombus include a mural or pedunculated echodensity often of similar acoustic properties to normal myocardium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F85959%7ECARD%2F85958\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef85959 graphicRef85958 \">movie 2A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiography in detection of cardiac and aortic sources of systemic embolism&quot;, section on 'Left ventricular thrombi'</a>.)</p><p>TTE image quality may be suboptimal due to conditions such as chronic pulmonary disease or obesity. Distinguishing thrombus from normal trabeculations may be difficult. The sonographer should be prepared to perform echocardiography with an intravenous endocardial border definition contrast agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. With contrast injection, LV thrombi appear as a filling defect separated from the myocardium by contrast, while muscular structures or spontaneous echo contrast (smoke) are obscured. Near field artifact may also give the appearance of apical thrombus. </p><p>In patients where there remains uncertainty regarding the presence or absence of thrombus, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with gadolinium contrast should be considered. We consider transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) inferior to long inversion time late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)-CMR for the diagnosis of LV thrombus since the apex is often not well visualized by the former test, but may be considered when CMR is not available. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) is another option. &#160;</p><p>CMR is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of LV thrombus. Long inversion time LGE-CMR has a greater sensitivity than TTE and a similarly high specificity for the detection of LV thrombus in an ischemic cardiomyopathy population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. However, it is not used to screen for LV thrombus due to issues of cost and availability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In a retrospective study of 160 patients with a remote prior MI who had surgical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pathological confirmation of the presence (48 patients [30 percent]) or absence of LV thrombus, all patients underwent non-simultaneous preoperative LGE CMR, TTE, and intraoperative TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. CMR was significantly more sensitive (88 versus 23 and 40 percent with TTE and TEE, respectively). All imaging modalities had specificities of 96 percent or greater. </p><p>In a study, 201 patients were evaluated with noncontrast and contrast TTE, cine-CMR, and LGE-CMR 7 to 30 days after STEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Using LGE-CMR as the gold standard for determining the presence of absence of LV thrombus, the following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LV thrombus was present in 17 patients (8 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sensitivity of noncontrast and contrast TTE was only 35 and 64 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The specificity of noncontrast and contrast TTE was 98 and 99 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only 12 percent of patients with thrombus had a LV ejection fraction &le;30 percent and LV aneurysm was present in only 24 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On both noncontrast and contrast TTE, a high apical wall motion score, as measure of apical dysfunction, was strongly correlated with the presence of LV thrombus. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4133411725\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF EMBOLIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to clot within the arterial circulation in other locations, the natural history of left ventricular (LV) thrombi includes complete resolution and endothelialization. Prior to one of these end points, embolization may occur.</p><p>The risk of embolization in patients with a documented LV thrombus who are not treated with anticoagulant therapy has been reported to be between 10 and 15 percent. In a series of 85 patients with LV thrombus (most of whom had a recent myocardial infarction [MI]) who were followed for almost two years, an embolic event occurred in 11 (13 percent) of those with thrombi compared with only 2 of 91 (2 percent) in a matched control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A 1993 meta-analysis included 11 studies of 856 patients who had had an anterior MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The odds ratio for an embolic event was 5.5 (95% CI 3.0-9.8) comparing those with, with those without, an LV mural thrombus documented on transthoracic echocardiography. Most embolic events occur within the first three to four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2,5,6,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6,20-23</a>], although some occur later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Two major echocardiographic risk factors for embolization have been identified: thrombus mobility and thrombus protrusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2,6,20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,20,24</a>]. In one report, embolization occurred in 26 of 119 patients with an LV thrombus after acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Free mobility of the thrombus was present in 58 percent of patients with embolization compared with 3 percent without embolization; among the 18 patients with free thrombus mobility, embolization occurred in 15 (83 percent compared with 11 percent without mobility). Protrusion of the thrombus into the LV cavity was present in 88 percent of those patients with clinical thromboembolism compared with 18 percent without; among the 40 patients with thrombus protrusion, embolization occurred in 23 (58 percent compared with 4 percent without protrusion).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16390947\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF EMBOLIC EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticoagulant therapy should be started early after myocardial infarction (MI) and continued for at least three months to lower the risk of thrombus <span class=\"nowrap\">development/growth</span> and embolization in patients with documented left ventricular (LV) thrombus or those at high risk. Most events occur within the first three to four months; this observation forms the basis for our recommendations regarding the duration of anticoagulant therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4133411725\" class=\"local\">'Risk of embolization'</a> above.)</p><p>Early studies found that that anticoagulation with heparin, if started early and continued for more than 48 hours, lowers the risk of thrombus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other studies suggested benefit from parenteral anticoagulation for up to 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. However, we do not recommend prolonged parenteral therapy, as early initiation of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy in appropriate patients is likely to be as effective and is more practical. </p><p>Although there are no studies that have evaluated the optimal timing of parenteral anticoagulation in patients being started on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, we believe it is reasonable to start therapy as soon as an at-risk patient is identified and to discontinue parenteral therapy when effective anticoagulation with warfarin has been achieved (international normalized ratio of 2 to 3) or the diagnosis has been excluded.</p><p>There are no randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of prolonged oral anticoagulation in the present reperfusion era to prevent embolization in patients with an LV thrombus after MI. Nevertheless, observational studies provide support for a recommendation to anticoagulate reperfused patients with documented LV thrombus after MI to reduce the risk of embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21-23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 43 patients with LV thrombus after MI who were followed for a mean of 15 months, there were no embolic events in the 25 patients treated with anticoagulation; in comparison, 7 of 18 untreated patients had an embolic event, all occurring within four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of seven observational studies that included 270 patients with anterior MI and transthoracic echocardiography-documented LV thrombus, anticoagulation (compared with no anticoagulation) was associated with an 86 percent reduction in the rate of embolization (odds ratio 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.52) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p>While we believe that anticoagulant therapy will also be of benefit to those at high risk, defined as those with an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 30 percent or a severe anteroapical wall motion abnormality with apical aneurysm, this issue has not been studied. Similar patients with an LVEF between 30 and 40 percent may also benefit, but the benefit-to-(bleeding)-risk ratio declines.</p><p>All decisions regarding the prolonged use of anticoagulant therapy in these patients must take into account the concurrent risk of bleeding. Bleeding is a particularly important issue, as many of these patients will need to be on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy due to the placement of an intracoronary stent after an acute coronary syndrome.

Similarly, triple antithrombotic therapy has not been directly compared with DAPT in MI patients at risk for LV thrombus. In the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis guidelines, which include a document on &quot;Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,&quot; the authors used indirect evidence to compare expected outcomes between triple antithrombotic therapy or DAPT in patients with acute, large anterior MI at risk for or with LV thrombus who undergo PCI with stent placement (either bare-metal or drug-eluting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The anticipated effects over three months (comparing triple therapy with DAPT) included no effect on total mortality, a decrease in nonfatal MI (relative risk [RR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.54-0.88), a decrease in all strokes (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39-0.82), and an increase in major extracranial bleeds (RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.62-3.47).</p><p>Triple antithrombotic therapy has not been compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> plus one antiplatelet agent in reperfused patients and we do not recommend the latter approach.

Thus, these agents are not recommended.</p><p>Finally, there are no high-quality studies that address the issue of the optimal antithrombotic regimen in these patients with LV thrombus who are not stented.

Patients with an LVEF between 30 and 40 percent are also at risk, but the level of risk is not as great. In all patients, the benefit from anticoagulant therapy must be weighed against the risk of bleeding. This is particularly important since many patients will be receiving triple antithrombotic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> plus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for some period of time.

Based on a limited amount of evidence, we believe it is reasonable to get a follow-up TTE (if the thrombus was previously visualized on TTE) to either see if the thrombus&nbsp;identified&nbsp;on the first TTE has resolved or organized or to assess the degree of left ventricular (LV) remodeling. We obtain this follow-up TTE between one and three months after initial identification.</p><p>The findings of persistent pedunculation of the thrombus may reasonably lead to a decision to prolong anticoagulation beyond the recommended time; the finding of significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction and apical wall motion abnormality may reasonably lead to a decision to shorten the duration of anticoagulation</p><p>In three series in which serial TTE was performed, thrombus resolution was seen in 14 of 29 patients (47 percent) at six months, 24 of 51 (47 percent) at one year, and 16 of 21 (76 percent) at two-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/4,6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,12</a>].

Patients with large anterior MI are at the highest risk for the development of LV thrombi; these patients usually have an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40 percent and a severe anteroapical wall motion abnormality on an imaging study. (See <a href=\"#H3248365798\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients at risk of LV thrombus, we recommend a transthoracic echocardiogram with echo contrast to screen for LV thrombus. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most at-risk patients (LVEF less than 30 percent and an anteroapical wall motion abnormality) should be treated with anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization of thrombi. However, as anticoagulant therapy is usually coupled with antiplatelet therapy, the risk of major bleeding must be weighed against this benefit in all patients. (See <a href=\"#H16390947\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of embolic events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our specific recommendations for the use of anticoagulation are as follows (see <a href=\"#H16390955\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with MI and documented LV thrombus or those at high risk (LVEF less than 30 percent and a severe anteroapical wall motion abnormality on imaging 48 hours after reperfusion), we recommend anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). <br/><br/>For high bleeding risk patients, the combination of oral anticoagulation and a single antiplatelet could be considered, though there is no direct evidence to support this approach. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with MI and an LVEF between 30 and 40 percent with a severe anteroapical wall motion abnormality on imaging, we suggest anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The relative benefits and risks of anticoagulation need to be weighed carefully in this group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Parenteral anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> or low molecular weight heparin should be started as soon as an at-risk patient is identified and continued until effective anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> has been achieved. Warfarin should be started soon after initiation of parenteral anticoagulation; the goal of therapy is an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3. <br/><br/>The non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are not recommended, as no comparative efficacy data are available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest continuing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> for three months rather than a longer duration (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
