While much of the available data have focused on the effects of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs on pregnancy, little attention has been paid to the impact of these drugs on male gonadal function, particularly spermatogenesis and risk of teratogenicity in offspring.</p><p>The effects of drugs used to treat rheumatic disease on male gonadal function and the risk of teratogenicity will be reviewed here. The impact of these agents on female fertility, pregnancy, and lactation and the effects of cytotoxic agents on gonadal function in adult men are discussed in detail elsewhere.

The testes contain two anatomical units: the seminiferous tubules, composed of germ cells and Sertoli cells, and the interstitium, containing Leydig cells that produce testosterone. Spermatogenesis is much more likely to be disrupted than testosterone production, because the actively proliferating germinal epithelium of the testes is more sensitive to damage from cytotoxic drugs than are the Leydig cells. The magnitude of the effect on sperm production is drug-specific, dose-dependent, and duration-dependent. Additional factors that may influence gonadal function in patients receiving these medications include effects of the underlying disease (eg, chronic kidney or pulmonary disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of cytotoxic agents on gonadal function in adult men&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p>When a drug has adverse effects on sperm production and function, there is concern that the exposure could also affect fetal outcome. However, unlike teratogenic agents affecting pregnant women, in the male, these agents do not seem to directly interfere with normal fetal development. (See <a href=\"#H3757945\" class=\"local\">'Teratogenic concerns'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3757966\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH RISK OF PERMANENT AZOOSPERMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chemotherapeutic agents with the most deleterious effect on male fertility are the alkylating agents, which can induce irreversible or prolonged oligozoospermia or azoospermia, compromising fertility. The risk of alkylating agent-related infertility is dose- and age-dependent. These drugs all have cumulative dose ranges above which most patients will be rendered permanently infertile. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of cytotoxic agents on gonadal function in adult men&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to receiving these medications, patients should be informed of the potential for cryopreservation of semen containing viable sperm for subsequent use in assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men#H34\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of cytotoxic agents on gonadal function in adult men&quot;, section on 'Semen cryopreservation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3758895\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclophosphamide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclophosphamide</a> (CYC) is a cytotoxic alkylating agent, which can have profound effects on male fertility and which may induce permanent infertility. These effects are dose-related; cumulative cyclophosphamide doses of 6 to 10 grams are likely to result in oligospermia and often in irreversible azoospermia. Repeated exposure may be more harmful than single exposure at the same total dose. Male patients receiving doses in this range should be counseled about cryopreservation of sperm. (See <a href=\"#H617236150\" class=\"local\">'Semen cryopreservation'</a> below.)</p><p>There are insufficient data to define the risk of teratogenicity in the offspring of men treated with CYC. In view of these data and in the absence of direct information about male-mediated teratogenicity caused by CYC use, we suggest that men should discontinue this medication for at least three months before attempting conception. Given the lack of sufficiently informative data on the optimal duration, some experts prefer a longer interval (eg, 9 to 12 months) to account for the possibility that non-proliferating stem cells and early germ cells may undergo development over a longer time period than one spermatogenic cycle after initial exposure to cytotoxic agents. It is important for the clinician to facilitate informed decision-making by the couple interested in fertility.</p><p>Additional information regarding the adverse effects, use, and monitoring of this medication is presented elsewhere.

That said, for a number of drugs, the manufacturer's package insert advises caution and suggests stopping these medications for three months prior to attempting pregnancy to allow for recovery and production of new sperm that have not been exposed to the drug. The three-month duration is based upon sperm formation taking approximately 74 days from the spermatocyte stage, and the transport of sperm through the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts requires about 14 days.</p><p>Drugs with such guidance include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> (MTX)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Leflunomide</a> (LEF)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4980980\"><span class=\"h2\">Methotrexate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paternal exposure to MTX around the time of conception does not appear to have adverse consequences for pregnancy outcomes.

Several mechanisms contribute to drug-induced infertility, particularly medication effects on the germinal epithelium of the testes. There are also concerns that some of these drugs could be teratogenic. We advise men to discontinue some of these drugs for three months prior to pursuing pregnancy, to allow for recovery of spermatogenesis and to avoid any potential teratogenicity. (See <a href=\"#H3759728\" class=\"local\">'Effects on male gonadal function'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3757945\" class=\"local\">'Teratogenic concerns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (CYC) be discontinued for a minimum of three months before attempting pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). CYC, an alkylating agent, is associated with a high risk of irreversible azoospermia and should therefore be used with caution in patients anticipating future attempts at pregnancy; the risk of teratogenicity in men is undefined. Patients considering use of CYC should be advised regarding strategies for preservation of fertility (most importantly, semen cryopreservation). (See <a href=\"#H3757966\" class=\"local\">'High risk of permanent azoospermia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H617236150\" class=\"local\">'Semen cryopreservation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ) can reversibly induce oligospermia or azoospermia, as well as abnormal sperm function.

Very limited data suggest that regular use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (ASA) and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may have, at most, modest effects on sperm number and function with chronic use.
