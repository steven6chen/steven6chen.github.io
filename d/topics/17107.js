However, approximately one-third of patients will not become seizure-free with medications and require nonpharmacologic treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although epilepsy surgery is usually considered for these patients, there are many families and patients who are either unwilling to consider or are not candidates for epilepsy surgery, either because surgery would lead to intolerable motor, language, or memory deficits or for other reasons. In these patients, treatments such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and dietary therapies are then considered.</p><p>This topic will review the ketogenic and alternative diets for the treatment of epilepsy. Some of the preliminary evidence for use of the ketogenic diet in other neurologic conditions will also be briefly reviewed. Other treatments for seizures and epilepsy in adults and children with epilepsy are reviewed separately.

The mechanism by which the ketogenic diet suppresses seizures is likely multifactorial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The ketogenic diet utilizes a high fat, adequate-protein (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">gram/kg),</span> low-carbohydrate diet that produces metabolic changes often associated with the starvation state. Often started with a brief fasting period, changes in plasma ketones, insulin, glucose, glucagon, and free fatty acids can occur within hours of starting the diet and can be quite profound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Which of these metabolic changes are primarily responsible for the improvement in seizure frequency is not known. The ketogenic diet was so called based upon the theory that ketone bodies (acetoacetate, acetone, and beta-hydroxybutyrate), created in the liver from long and medium-chain fatty acids, are directly anticonvulsant when crossing the blood-brain barrier. Urine and occasionally serum ketone levels are generally checked in patients on the ketogenic diet to ensure the diet is being managed correctly, in a manner analogous to following antiseizure drug levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>However, the importance of ketosis in the mechanism of action of the ketogenic diet is increasingly questioned. Increased mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, enhanced gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, reduced neuronal excitability and firing, and stabilized synaptic function have been shown to occur in patients on the ketogenic diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. While these may be induced by ketosis, alternative mechanisms proposed include elevated plasma free fatty acids (including polyunsaturated fatty acids), reduced glucose fluctuations, increased activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, caloric restriction, and elevated brain amino acids. Inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and decreased glutamatergic synaptic transmission have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

A meta-analysis of 19 observational studies (1084 patients) found that after six months, approximately 60 percent of children started on the ketogenic diet had a greater than 50 percent seizure reduction, with 30 percent having greater than 90 percent seizure reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

While more often considered a treatment in children rather than adults with epilepsy, the growing available (nonrandomized) evidence suggests that adults may also achieve benefit while on the diet; adults are more commonly offered the modified Atkins diet due to ease of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21468923\" class=\"local\">'Modified Atkins diet'</a> below.)</p><p>The first randomized trial of the ketogenic diet was reported in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. One hundred and forty-five children (ages 2 to 16 years) with intractable epilepsy (failure of at least two antiseizure drugs) were assigned to immediate implementation of the ketogenic diet or to a control group in whom implementation was delayed for three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. At three months, 103 remained in the trial, 54 in the active treatment group. In these patients, treatment with the diet was associated with a lower mean percentage of baseline seizures (62 versus 137 percent) and a higher percentage with greater than 50 percent seizure reduction (38 versus 6 percent).</p><p>Based upon the available evidence, most (21 of 26) members of a 2009 expert consensus panel felt that the ketogenic diet should be considered in children with intractable epilepsy after unsuccessful treatment trials of two or three antiseizure drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One unanswered question is whether the ketogenic diet is better than a third or fourth medication. Although the data would suggest that the diet is more likely to be of benefit (50 to 60 percent chance of &gt;50 percent seizure reduction, compared with approximately 30 percent chance with an additional medication), this has never been formally studied in a randomized, prospective manner.</p><p>For patients with specific conditions that appear to be particularly responsive to the ketogenic diet, it is reasonable to consider this treatment earlier.

A low cerebrospinal fluid glucose level suggests this diagnosis. It may also present with early-onset absence epilepsy. The diagnosis can be confirmed in most cases with genetic testing (SLC2A1 mutation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The ketogenic diet is a highly effective first-line treatment for this disorder and provides ketones as an alternative energy source for the brain.

However, the diagnosis of GLUT-1 deficiency is often delayed, and developmental outcomes may be better with early initiation of dietary therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ketogenic-diet-and-other-dietary-therapies-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].
