Although they are commonly thought of as intrathoracic tumors, 50 to 70 percent of SFTs arise outside the thorax, including the central nervous system (CNS). The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of SFT at sites other than the CNS are reviewed here. <span class=\"nowrap\">SFTs/hemangiopericytomas</span> arising within the CNS are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncommon-brain-tumors#H2388141401\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncommon brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13807859\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE AND NOMENCLATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SFT was first described in the pleura in 1931 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and historically recognized by several names, including benign mesothelioma, localized mesothelioma, solitary fibrous mesothelioma, pleural fibroma, submesothelial fibroma, subserosal fibroma, and localized fibrous tumor. SFT is now recognized to occur anywhere in the body, including soft tissue and viscera, albeit with a peculiar predilection for body cavity sites, including pleura, peritoneum, and meninges.</p><p>Hemangiopericytomas were first described in 1942 and initially thought to be a vascular neoplasm related to smooth muscle perivascular cells known as pericytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the diagnosis was largely descriptive, based upon a nonspecific, albeit characteristic, staghorn vascular pattern, and the term became a &quot;wastebasket&quot; diagnosis, which included a variety of unrelated benign and malignant entities. With the advent of diagnostic immunohistochemistry (IHC) and cytogenetic analysis, pathologists were able to exclude histologic mimics, and hemangiopericytoma became more accepted as a distinct entity, although largely a diagnosis of exclusion, until the recognition of phenotypic and behavioral overlap with SFT led pathologists to consider the two as one tumor type.</p><p>The discovery of a shared, recurrent, and thus far unique gene fusion in SFT and tumors histologically identified as hemangiopericytoma has confirmed the identical nature of these tumors. At present, the term SFT is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] and use of the term &quot;hemangiopericytoma&quot; is discouraged in clinical practice. However, some neuropathologists still prefer the term hemangiopericytoma in reference to meningeal tumors to emphasize their aggressive behavior compared with other SFT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncommon-brain-tumors#H2388141401\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncommon brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma'</a>.)</p><p>Sinonasal glomangiopericytoma, sometimes also called &quot;sinonasal hemangiopericytoma,&quot; is a clinically, morphologically, and biologically distinct entity that differs from SFT and should not be confused with it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Data on the presentation, clinical features, and natural history of SFT are nearly exclusively derived from retrospective series and case reports. The rarity of SFT, historical bias in subclassifying tumors by body site (pleural versus extrapleural) and histology (SFT versus hemangiopericytoma), as well as changes in diagnostic terminology over the years have resulted in a fragmented, unsystematic approach to this uncommon neoplasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517218693\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the true incidence is difficult to ascertain, SFTs are thought to be rare overall and accounted for less than 2 percent of all soft tissue tumors presenting to a large referral center in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. SFTs arising from the pleura, the most common single site, have been estimated to occur with a frequency of 2.8 per 100,000 individuals, and only 900 cases were reported in the literature up to 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Pleural SFTs account for less than 5 percent of all tumors arising from the pleura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,13</a>].</p><p>SFTs may arise at any age, but are most common in the fifth<sup> </sup>to seventh decades. Meningeal tumors arise in slightly younger patients (fourth decade), while pleural SFTs often present in older patients (sixth<sup> </sup>to seventh decade, median age at diagnosis 56 to 60) compared with SFTs arising intra-abdominally or in soft tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/5,6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,14</a>]. Men and women are affected with equal frequency.</p><p>There is no known association with environmental exposure to radiation, tobacco, asbestos, or other toxicants, and no known inherited, predisposing risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13807503\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC DISTRIBUTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SFTs preferentially arise in serosal membranes, the dura of the meninges, and deep soft tissues. In contemporary series, approximately 30 percent of cases arise in the thoracic cavity (including pleura, lungs, and mediastinum). Intrathoracic SFTs may arise in the pleura, mediastinum, or lung parenchyma.</p><p>Another 30 percent arise in the peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneal soft tissue, or pelvis (including visceral sites). Intra-abdominal SFTs in the peritoneum, retroperitoneum, and pelvis constitute the largest site-related group in most series of extrapleural SFTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The retroperitoneum is the most common intra-abdominal site, followed by the pelvic soft tissues. Visceral involvement, particularly of the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and genitourinary tract (bladder, prostate, seminal vesicle, kidney) may also occur. In large tumors involving multiple subsites (eg, pelvic soft tissue and urogenital tract), it may not be possible to accurately determine the site of primary origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; this distinction has no biologic significance, but may impact the initial formulation of a differential diagnosis.</p><p>Approximately 20 percent of SFTs occur in the head and neck (including the meninges) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/8,17-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17-23</a>]. SFTs of the extracranial head and neck most often arise in the sinonasal tract, oral cavity, and deep soft tissues, including orbit.</p><p>The remaining cases involve deep soft tissues of the trunk and extremities, or occasionally may arise in bone. It is extremely rare for SFTs to primarily involve superficial soft tissues (eg, dermis), and care must be taken to exclude histologic mimics, such as benign fibrous histiocytoma or dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, before making the diagnosis in superficial sites. (See <a href=\"#H21008298\" class=\"local\">'Histologic variants'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H153570996\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21008145\"><span class=\"h2\">Pleuropulmonary SFT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At presentation, approximately 40 to 60 percent of patients have nonspecific pulmonary symptoms, typically cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/11,14,15,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,15,24-26</a>]. Rarely, hemoptysis and obstructive pneumonitis may occur as a result of airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/14,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,27</a>]. In other cases, an intrathoracic mass is incidentally detected in asymptomatic individuals at the time of chest imaging carried out for an unrelated reason. </p><p>Pleural SFTs can reach an enormous size while remaining asymptomatic. Large tumors that are not discovered incidentally can cause symptoms as a result of mechanical compression (eg, of the inferior vena cava, causing lower extremity edema, or of the heart).</p><p>As many as 20 percent of pleuropulmonary SFT cases may be associated with digital clubbing and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO; Pierre-Marie-Bamberger syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H517218766\" class=\"local\">'Paraneoplastic syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p>Two-thirds of pleural SFTs occur in the visceral pleura, where the tumor is often attached to the lung by a narrow pedicle, and one-third occur in the parietal pleura, where the tumors are often larger, with a broad-based attachment. Sometimes, imaging may not be able to determine whether the mass is arising from the pleura or from the mediastinum, and the actual site of origin may not be evident until surgery. (See <a href=\"#H13807897\" class=\"local\">'Imaging findings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21008093\"><span class=\"h2\">Intra-abdominal SFT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A palpable abdominal mass is the most common presentation of an intra-abdominal SFT, followed by pain and weight loss. Urinary symptoms including dysuria, urinary retention, hydronephrosis, nocturia, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation, incontinence, or vomiting have also been reported. Because small tumors are typically asymptomatic, intra-abdominal SFTs may attain large sizes (&gt;20 cm) prior to presentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21008115\"><span class=\"h2\">Meningeal SFT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Within the central nervous system (CNS), <span class=\"nowrap\">SFT/hemangiopericytoma</span> are typically intracranial and originate from the dura. Clinically resembling meningiomas, these tumors cause symptoms by means of a slow increase in size, either by compressing adjacent structures or by increasing intracranial pressure. The clinical presentation of <span class=\"nowrap\">SFT/hemangiopericytoma</span> arising in the brain is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncommon-brain-tumors#H2388141401\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncommon brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1030394793\"><span class=\"h2\">Extracranial SFT of the head and neck</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SFTs arising in the extracranial head account for about 10 percent of cases and typically present early as small, symptomatic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In the orbit, the clinical presentation may include an expanding mass in the eyelid or orbit, epiphora (excess tearing), or proptosis.</p><p>In the oral cavity, SFTs can occur beneath the buccal mucosa, tongue, and lower lip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. SFTs may also arise within the sinonasal tract, where they often present with <span class=\"nowrap\">sinus/nasal</span> obstruction and painless mass. Tumors arising in the deep soft tissue of the cheek or neck most commonly present as a painless mass. Local recurrence is common when tumors arise in difficult-to-access sites of the orbit or sinonasal tract, where complete, en bloc resection cannot be assured. While most tumors behave in a benign fashion, malignant behavior has been reported. (See <a href=\"#H21008375\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis, recurrence risk, and assessing malignant potential'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21008130\"><span class=\"h2\">Soft tissue SFT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 percent of SFTs arise from deep tissues of the extremities, abdominal wall, and other sites, including the bones and diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/15,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,29</a>]. As with SFTs at other sites, the most common presenting symptom is a painless mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>]. Paresthesias or other nerve symptoms may be present if the tumor impinges upon a nerve. SFTs are frequently slow-growing and the mass may be long-standing, gradually enlarging over several years, if not decades. Soft tissue SFTs tend to be smaller at presentation than pleural or intra-abdominal SFTs, likely due to the relative ease of detection earlier in the course of disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517218766\"><span class=\"h2\">Paraneoplastic syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uncommonly, patients come to clinical attention because of a paraneoplastic syndrome, most commonly hypoglycemia. Paraneoplastic syndromes may occur in patients with SFT arising in all sites.</p><p>Refractory hypoglycemia (Doege-Potter syndrome) occurs in &lt;5 percent of cases and is primarily seen in large <span class=\"nowrap\">peritoneal/pleural</span> tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. It is caused by tumor secretion of large insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In up to 20 percent of cases, pleuropulmonary SFT may be associated with hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Originally described in 1935 by Bamberger and Pierre Marie and occasionally referred to as Pierre-Marie-Bamberger syndrome, HPO is characterized by clubbing of the fingers, periostitis, and synovial effusions. Although the precise mechanism underlying HPO is unclear, chronic hypoxia and tumoral secretion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> or cytokines have all been proposed as effectors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-and-rheumatic-disorders#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy and rheumatic disorders&quot;, section on 'Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32709122\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of SFT may be suspected based upon imaging and clinical features. However, a definitive diagnosis requires histologic confirmation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13807897\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging findings</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H411244127\"><span class=\"h3\">General features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic findings of a SFT on cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are similar to those of other soft tissue tumors, and there are no pathognomonic features that are specific for this tumor type. Regardless of site, SFTs usually appear as a well-circumscribed soft tissue mass, which may be lobulated. Tumors are often homogenous in appearance, although cystic areas, calcifications, myxoid degeneration, or hemorrhage may be apparent, particularly in large tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63307\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63307 \">image 1</a>). SFTs tend to displace rather than invade surrounding tissues, and infiltrative borders may only rarely be appreciated in aggressive disease. The tumors enhance after contrast administration, and the enhancement may be homogeneous or heterogeneous.</p><p>On MRI, SFTs typically display low T1 signal intensity and variable T2 signal. Densely collagenized hypocellular tumors typically have low signal on T2-weighted images, while hypercellular tumors, highly vascular edematous tumors, or those with necrosis or myxoid degenerative changes demonstrate high signal intensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. SFTs enhance intensely after intravenous gadolinium administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662632774\"><span class=\"h3\">Thorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On chest radiograph, pleuropulmonary SFTs usually appear as a well-defined, rounded, homogeneous mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75098\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75098 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>On CT, SFT of the pleura typically appears as a well-delineated and occasionally lobulated mass of soft tissue attenuation arising from the pleura (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65286\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65286 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/12,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,42</a>]. Large tumors may attain a diameter greater than 20 cm. The tumors typically appear in contact with the pleural surface and show displacement or, less frequently, invasion of the surrounding structures. A pedicle is present in 40 percent of cases, resulting in marked tumor mobility, change in shape, or change in location in sequential images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53533\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53533 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. A pleural effusion may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p>Occasionally, SFTs may simulate mediastinal, paravertebral, or intrapulmonary masses, depending upon their exact location within the pleural cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52030\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52030 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F89714\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89714 \">image 6</a>). Uncommonly, a tumor arising from the parietal pleura can be &quot;inverted&quot; and appear to grow within the lung parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>MRI imaging is of limited utility for the assessment of pleural tumors. However, the morphology and relationship of SFT to adjacent mediastinal or major vascular structures, or the presence and extent of <span class=\"nowrap\">vertebral/foraminal</span> involvement for large posterior chest tumors may be better appreciated with MRI than with CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Furthermore, MRI may be helpful in confirming intrathoracic localization when the tumor abuts the diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662632856\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominopelvic tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The imaging appearance of SFT arising in the abdominopelvic cavity is similar to that arising in the thorax. The margins are well defined, the mass may be lobulated, and there is generally a lack of gross infiltration into adjacent tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F101149\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101149 \">image 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/29,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,50</a>].</p><p>SFTs arising in visceral sites such as the liver or kidney typically manifest as a large well-defined heterogeneously enhancing mass with or without areas of necrosis. A capsule may be evident (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F101150\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101150 \">image 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F101152\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101152 \">image 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662633227\"><span class=\"h3\">Extracranial head and neck</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On CT, extracranial SFTs of the head and neck appear as a solitary well-circumscribed mass that may be isointense to muscle on non-contrast studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-55</a>]. The most common radiographic osseous finding is regressive remodeling of adjacent bone due to the long-standing pressure effects of the slow-growing mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Radiographic evidence of bone destruction may be seen, and this does not necessarily correlate with histologic features of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation of intracranial (CNS) <span class=\"nowrap\">SFT/hemangiopericytoma</span> is presented elsewhere.

Fine needle aspiration biopsies are often inadequately cellular and are not recommended for diagnosis. In most cases, core biopsy will provide diagnostic material to establish a diagnosis of SFT, but the limited sampling provided by core biopsy may not accurately demonstrate the histologic evidence indicative of high risk of aggressive behavior.</p><p>Grossly, SFTs range from &lt;1 cm to over 40 cm in diameter. Tumors are usually well circumscribed, with a fibrous pseudocapsule or serosal lining. Pleural tumors are frequently pedunculated; the pedicle typically contains large feeder vessels for the tumor. The cut surface of SFT ranges from firm and white for more fibrous tumors to tan and fleshy for cellular variants. Hemorrhage, necrosis, or calcification may be present, particularly in larger tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Histologically, SFTs comprise a spectrum, with classic fibrous pleural SFTs representing the hypocellular phenotype and meningeal hemangiopericytomas typifying the hypercellular variant. Hypocellular SFTs are characterized by a dense collagenous background, often with hyalinized or thick collagen bands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F101053\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101053 \">picture 1</a>). Variably atypical spindled cells are arrayed haphazardly within this stroma, in a storiform configuration or in randomly oriented fascicles, characteristically referred to as the so-called &quot;patternless pattern.&quot; Less and more cellular areas alternate. Thin-walled, branching capillaries are always present but may not be prominent.</p><p>On the hypercellular end of the tumor spectrum, collagen fibers are scant or entirely absent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F101054\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101054 \">picture 2</a>). Instead, tumors are composed of solid nests of neoplastic cells interspersed with very prominent branching and anastomosing &quot;staghorn&quot; capillaries. In cellular SFT, tumor cells may lose their spindled morphology and become more ovoid to rounded. Hemorrhage is common in cellular tumors, and necrosis may be present.</p><p>SFTs have a spectrum of biologic behavior, with the majority of tumors behaving in an indolent fashion with low risk of local recurrence or metastasis. A minority of tumors recur locally or go on to metastasize to distant sites. (See <a href=\"#H21008375\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis, recurrence risk, and assessing malignant potential'</a> below.)</p><p>Histologic features have historically been used to attempt to define &quot;benign&quot; or &quot;malignant&quot; SFT in order to identify high-risk patients.

Furthermore, it is increasingly recognized that there is no strict dichotomy between benign and malignant SFT, and all tumors likely have some degree of metastatic potential, albeit quite low in the majority of cases. Therefore, the behavior of SFT is difficult to predict based upon histologic features alone. This has led to attempts to combine histologic and clinical features into scoring systems to estimate the risk of malignant behavior.

The histologic differential diagnosis for SFT is discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H5023235\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Conventional IHC markers of SFT include expression of CD34, Bcl2, CD99, and vimentin in the absence of actin, desmin, S100 protein, or epithelial markers (epithelial membrane antigen [EMA], low molecular weight cytokeratins).

However, STAT6 positivity alone may not be sufficient to distinguish some cases of SFT from its histologic mimic <span class=\"nowrap\">well-differentiated/de-differentiated</span> liposarcoma, as these tumors also rarely overexpress full-length STAT6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. However, SFT lacks expression of MDM2 and CDK4, while well-differentiated and de-differentiated liposarcoma will be positive for these markers. Moreover, STAT6 in SFT is typically confined to the nucleus, while well- and de-differentiated liposarcoma express STAT6 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32709116\"><span class=\"h3\">Molecular pathogenesis and molecular diagnostics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SFTs of all sites, including meningeal tumors, are characterized by a recurrent inversion of the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q13). This inversion results in a fusion of two genes, <em>NAB2 </em>and <em>STAT6</em> (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/60,66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,66-68</a>]. The <em>NAB2</em> gene encodes a member of the family of NGFI-A (Nerve Growth Factor Inducible A gene) binding (NAB) proteins, which function in the nucleus to repress transcription induced by some members of the EGR (early growth response) family of transactivators, which are involved in cellular differentiation and proliferation. The product of the <em>STAT6</em> gene is an inflammatory signaling intermediary that acts as a transcriptional transactivator. (See <a href=\"#H21008319\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary diagnostic studies'</a> above.)</p><p>The fusion of <em>NAB2 </em>and <em>STAT6</em> creates a chimeric transcription factor in which the <em>NAB2</em> repressor domain is substituted by a carboxy-terminal <em>STAT6</em> transactivation domain or near-full-length <em>STAT6</em>. The <em>NAB2-STAT6</em> chimeric transcription factor constitutively localizes to the nucleus, where it is thought to serve as a driver of tumorigenesis by constitutively activating <em>NAB2</em> target genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>The <em>NAB2-STAT6</em> fusion gene is a distinct molecular feature of SFT, present in up to 100 percent of cases, which has not been detected in other tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>]. Other molecular abnormalities that drive tumorigenesis in SFT are extremely rare, although mutations in the platelet-derived growth factor beta (<em>PDGFRB</em>) gene have been reported in isolated instances of pleural SFT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>RT-PCR may be used to confirm the presence of the <em>NAB2-STAT6 </em>fusion gene, and this may assist in the diagnosis, but this is much less sensitive than IHC for STAT6 due to the diversity of possible fusion types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>]. The small size of the inverted sequence precludes the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 12q13 rearrangement as a diagnostic modality.</p><p>At present, there are no distinct molecular features clearly separating benign from malignant tumors. All tumors likely possess some degree of metastatic potential. While an early study suggested that specific <em>NAB2-STAT6 </em>fusion variants may be associated with higher risk of aggressive behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], this finding has not been confirmed by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>].

Reported 10-year disease-specific survival rates for both pleural and extrapleural SFTs are between 73 and 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/8,17,19,82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,19,82-84</a>]. However, there is a clinical spectrum of biologic behavior. The majority of SFTs behave in a benign fashion after complete resection and do not recur either locally or with distant metastases. Less frequently, some tumors recur locally and a few go on to metastasize to distant sites. While tumors are typically classified as histologically &quot;benign&quot; or &quot;malignant,&quot; in an attempt to provide clinical guidance for management and follow-up, it is unlikely that there is truly such an entity as a benign SFT, and all tumors should be considered to have some potential for recurrence and metastasis.</p><p>The behavior of SFT is difficult to predict based upon histologic features alone. Thus, while rare, histologically &quot;benign&quot; tumors may recur; recurrences may show identical histologic features as the primary tumor, or may show increased cellularity and mitotic activity. Exceedingly rarely, recurrences from &quot;benign&quot; SFT have taken the form of high-grade anaplastic sarcomas, consistent with so-called &quot;de-differentiation.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H583806869\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H662633559\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>In large series, 10 to 25 percent of pleural SFTs recur by 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/45,59,70,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,59,70,85</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H21008505\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>As yet, the underlying reason for the more aggressive behavior of some tumors is not known. The prognostic value of molecular biomarkers (eg, NAB2-STAT6 fusion type, secondary genetic alterations, mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase [<em>TERT</em>] gene promoter) is under study in patients with SFTs, but none is ready for clinical use, either alone or in conjunction with current scores that are based on clinicopathologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/26,69,70,73,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,69,70,73,87</a>].

Under the updated <span class=\"nowrap\">AJCC/UICC</span> guidelines, malignant SFT of the pleura are recommended to be staged using the retroperitoneal staging criteria, as no site-specific system exists for sarcomas arising in the pleura. Unfortunately, no guidance is provided as to how to classify SFTs as &quot;malignant,&quot; and as discussed below, the definition of malignancy in SFT remains a matter of some debate.

The authors used the <span class=\"nowrap\">absence/presence</span> of pleural pedunculation with histologic features of malignancy and the presence of metastasis to create a five-tiered staging system, which correlated with risk of local recurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F101069\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101069 \">table 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The de Perrot classification was validated in another series of 88 SFTs, in which de Perrot stage 0 to I tumors accounted for 67 percent, stage II for 18 percent, and stage III to IV for 15 percent of cases.

Low-risk patients, comprising 80 percent of cases, had a zero risk of recurrence at 15 years compared with 77 percent for those classified as high risk. There was no significant difference in overall survival when comparing patients classified as high or low risk for recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The follow-up validation study of 113 pleural SFTs demonstrated less impressive prognostic stratification for recurrence using this same cut-off, with sensitivity of only 78 percent, specificity of 74 percent, and both positive and negative likelihood ratios of 0.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Low-risk patients, comprising 70 percent of cases, had only 3.5 percent risk of recurrence at 15 years, compared with 27.9 percent for high-risk patients. High-risk patients also experienced worse long-term survival (overall survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 76, 73, and 66 percent, respectively, compared with 96, 91, and 89 percent, respectively, for those with low-risk [&lt; points] tumors). An analysis of cancer-specific survival could not be performed. When directly compared, the recurrence score outperformed both the England and de Perrot classifiers, as assessed by the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), which was 0.7730; the AUC-ROC for the England criteria (0.697) and the de Perrot classifier (0.524) were both significantly inferior.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Criteria for malignancy (ie, risk for local or distant recurrence) in SFT at <strong>extrapleural</strong> sites are largely based upon criteria developed for pleural tumors, as described above.

Two published risk stratification schema for SFT at all sites are available:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One published risk stratification system for SFT of all sites excluding meninges used patient age at presentation, tumor size, and mitotic count to stratify patients into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups for development of metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Points were assigned as follows: one point for age &ge;55 years, one point for size between 5 and 9.9 cm, two points for size 10 to 14.9 cm, three points for size &ge;15 cm, one point for one to three <span class=\"nowrap\">mitoses/10</span> HPF, and two points for &ge;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mitosis/10</span> HPF.

In the moderate-risk group, there was a 33 percent risk of metastases at five years, and the five-year disease-specific survival rate was 93 percent. This risk prognostication system has been validated in a small independent series of predominately low-risk SFT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. A further refinement of this model was also proposed incorporating necrosis as a fourth prognostic feature, the inclusion of which increased the number of cases correctly identified as being at minimal risk of metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. The advantage of this model is that it is applicable to both pleural and extrapleural SFTs. Moreover, it relies less on subjective histologic criteria that are not reported routinely in pathologic reports and more on ostensibly more reproducible objective criteria, which may allow for increased ease in clinical application outside of referral centers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second group has developed a risk calculator for prediction of local and metastatic recurrence in extrameningeal SFTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Four prognostic groups for local recurrence were defined based upon the number of unfavorable prognostic factors (age &lt;60, viscera localization, no radiation therapy). A three-tiered score was derived for stratifying the risk of metastatic recurrence that was based upon age (&lt;60 or &ge;60), mitotic count (&le;4 or &gt;4), and tumor localization (limb versus others). Independent validation of this prognostic model is needed. </p><p/><p>Without comparative data, it cannot be determined whether any of these risk stratification systems is better than any other. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345511673\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of SFTs at all sites should be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board with sarcoma specialists who have experience with this disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1534681155\"><span class=\"h2\">Localized disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete en bloc surgical resection is the mainstay of therapy for all localized SFTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Interestingly, in this study, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regorafenib</a> had the best preclinical activity and is being studied in a <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01900743?term=NCT01900743&rank=1&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPNJdo1suH2AQpwiA/eu6LM7oBFCyv5P5bEu2L4oXju4ZqtBgqThUPRi77fYbE5mTN0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=88706\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">phase II trial for soft tissue sarcomas</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the method used for response assessment may have been suboptimal. Radiographic response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is often indicated by an early decrease in tumor density followed by slow tumor regression. This pattern of response is not well suited to the use of standard RECIST, which is based upon tumor measurements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74693 \">table 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/116,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">116,117</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An alternative set of response evaluation criteria has been proposed: the so-called Choi criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/110,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,118</a>]. In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, a 10 percent decrease in unidimensional tumor size or a 15 percent decrease in tumor density on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans (as reflected by differences in X-ray attenuation between a given material and water, expressed in Hounsfield units) correlates well with positron emission tomography (PET) scan findings and is a better predictor of response to therapy (as judged by time to tumor progression) than standard RECIST. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors&quot;, section on 'RECIST versus CHOI criteria'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Choi response criteria were compared to RECIST in a multicenter, European, open-label, phase II trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pazopanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pazopanib</a> in 34 patients with malignant or dedifferentiated (anaplastic) SFT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. In a preliminary report of 31 evaluable patients presented at the 2017 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), according to Choi criteria, there were 16 partial responses (52 percent), and seven had stable disease (22 percent); the corresponding rates with use of RECIST were one partial response (3 percent) and 19 with stable disease (61 percent). The 18-month overall survival was 90 percent for those with a partial response plus stable disease and 25 percent for those with progressive disease according to the Choi criteria; it was 94 percent for those with a partial response plus stable disease and 45 percent for those with progressive disease according to RECIST. The authors concluded that pazopanib is an active agent in SFT and that Choi criteria provide a more accurate assessment of response than RECIST.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sorafenib</a>, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets VEGF, also appears to have antitumor efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/114,120,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,120,121</a>] in advanced SFT. As an example, in a subgroup analysis of a larger phase II trial of sorafenib in advanced soft tissue sarcomas, two of five patients with SFT (40 percent) had stable disease for nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The activity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=axitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">axitinib</a> is unclear.

Continued long-term follow-up is needed for high-risk individuals because of the indolent natural history and possibility of late recurrence up to 20 years after initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. A suggested posttreatment surveillance schedule for pleural SFT that is based upon the risk for malignant behavior is shown in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F101067\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101067 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-fibrous-tumor/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. It is difficult to extrapolate this algorithmic approach to posttreatment surveillance to extrapleural SFTs, as risk assessment has not focused so much on sessile versus pedunculated appearance, but more on pathologic characteristics. (See <a href=\"#H662633559\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13807921\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) comprises a histologic spectrum of rare soft tissue neoplasms demonstrating fibroblastic differentiation that includes hemangiopericytoma. Although the majority of SFTs show indolent behavior, with very low risk of recurrence or metastasis, some tumors behave in an aggressive fashion. (See <a href=\"#H517218373\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SFTs preferentially arise in serosal membranes, the dura of the meninges, and deep soft tissues. Although they are commonly described as predominantly intrathoracic tumors, approximately 50 to 70 percent are localized outside of the thorax. (See <a href=\"#H13807503\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleuropulmonary SFTs typically present with pulmonary symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, chest pain), although approximately one-third of cases are found incidentally during chest imaging. SFTs in other locations can present as a painless mass. SFTs infrequently have been associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, most commonly non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (Doege-Potter syndrome) or hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (Pierre-Marie-Bamberger syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H153570996\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic findings on cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are characteristic but not pathognomonic. Regardless of site, SFTs present as well-circumscribed soft tissue masses with a homogenous appearance, although cystic areas as well as calcifications and hemorrhage may be apparent. Tumors enhance after contrast administration, but this may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. (See <a href=\"#H13807897\" class=\"local\">'Imaging findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of SFT requires histologic examination of an adequate tissue sample and is based upon recognition of typical morphologic features in conjunction with a characteristic immunophenotype. Strong nuclear expression of STAT6 is a highly sensitive and specific immunohistochemical marker for SFT. In addition, SFTs of all sites, including meningeal tumors, are characterized by a recurrent inversion of the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q13), which results in a fusion of two genes, <em>NAB2 </em>and <em>STAT6</em>. Identification of the NAB2-STAT6 fusion protein can aid in the diagnosis of these tumors. (See <a href=\"#H21008319\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary diagnostic studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of SFTs behave in an indolent fashion and do not recur locally or distantly. However, 10 to 25 percent of tumors recur. Historically, a minority of SFTs has been classified as &quot;malignant&quot; based upon histologic demonstration of high mitotic activity, necrosis, tumor size &gt;10 cm, increased cellularity, nuclear pleomorphism, or <span class=\"nowrap\">stromal/vascular</span> invasion. (See <a href=\"#H583806869\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, a strong correlation between morphology and clinical course is lacking. Even among tumors classified as histologically malignant, 50 percent or more will be cured by resection alone, and only about 30 percent will eventually die of their disease, while rare cases of histologically &quot;benign&quot; tumors do progress. Exceedingly rarely, progression to high-grade anaplastic sarcoma (the so-called de-differentiated SFT) may be seen; such cases have high risk of disease progression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A number of risk scoring systems have been devised in attempts to more accurately predict the behavior of SFT based on a combination of clinical, pathologic, and anatomic criteria. (See <a href=\"#H21008375\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis, recurrence risk, and assessing malignant potential'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of SFT should be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board with sarcoma specialists who have experience with the disease. Complete en bloc surgical resection with negative margins (an R0 resection) is the mainstay of therapy for all localized SFTs, even for tumors classified as high-risk, given the low overall metastatic potential. (See <a href=\"#H21008505\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Postoperative (adjuvant) radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy have not been well studied in SFT. However, given the lack of data supporting benefit and the favorable outcomes from surgery in most cases, we suggest not pursuing adjuvant RT or chemotherapy for most patients with completely resected SFTs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The use of adjuvant RT or chemotherapy for incompletely resected or recurrent SFTs is best decided on a case-by-case basis in the context of a multidisciplinary discussion. (See <a href=\"#H21008536\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H242838894\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with retroperitoneal SFTs are eligible for the ongoing <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01344018?term=STRASS&rank=2&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPOr8GxMe8gJEpK72B0mZJ4hmiSLBaQt8t/+ifuitHPDvIxNmBpSqR4NKBqRgkx6TqA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=88706\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">EORTC STRASS study</a> of preoperative radiation 50.4 Gy and surgery versus surgery alone in nonmetastatic retroperitoneal sarcoma. Eligible patients should be encouraged to enroll. (See <a href=\"#H21008536\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment should be followed by careful long-term postoperative surveillance, which, at least for pleural tumors, may be tailored to the risk of recurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F101067\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101067 \">algorithm 1</a>). SFTs can recur locally, and such recurrences can often be managed successfully with re-resection. (See <a href=\"#H662633610\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distant metastases can occur, particularly in tumors that have histologic features of malignancy. For patients with metastatic and locally advanced, unresectable tumors, traditional soft tissue sarcoma chemotherapy may have minor activity. Less toxic and potentially more active agents targeting antiangiogenic pathways (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pazopanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pazopanib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>) offer promising alternatives. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is undefined in this diagnosis. Eligible patients should be encouraged to enroll in prospective trials testing the efficacy of novel therapies, where available.
