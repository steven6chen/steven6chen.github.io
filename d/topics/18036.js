It can be a disorder in its own right, or it can be a sign of another health problem.</p><p>There are several different types of tremor, all of which fall into one of the following categories:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Rest tremors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rest tremors happen while you are sitting or lying down and relaxed. People who have a rest tremor can usually stop the tremor by deliberately moving the affected body part.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Action tremors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Action tremors occur with voluntary muscle contraction. This category is further divided as follows:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3668422034\"><span class=\"h3\">Kinetic tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This type of tremor happens when you are doing a goal-directed activity, such as writing or drinking from a cup. &quot;Simple kinetic tremor&quot; remains constant throughout the action. &quot;Intention tremor&quot; gets worse gradually as you get closer to your target (eg, whatever you are reaching for with your arm).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2420896340\"><span class=\"h3\">Postural tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postural tremors happen when you try to hold a body part still, against the force of gravity. For example, your legs might shake when you are standing up, or your arms might shake if you hold them out in front of you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H239065811\"><span class=\"h3\">Isometric tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This type of tremor happens when you contract a muscle against an unmoving object, for example, pushing against a wall or making a fist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191186122\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional tremor can combine features of rest, postural, and action tremors. Unlike other kinds of tremor, functional tremor has no known medical cause. This kind of tremor usually gets less severe if you are distracted while your doctor examines you, for example, if he or she asks you to do something else with another part of your body (such as tap the fingers of your opposite hand). Other types of tremor tend to get worse with distraction.</p><p>Doctors use the term &quot;tremor syndromes&quot; to describe specific combinations of signs and symptoms that often happen together. They also define tremor syndromes as isolated, meaning that tremor is the only neurologic symptom, or combined, in which other neurologic problems are also present. Learning what type of tremor you have is the first step in discovering the cause of your tremor and its potential treatment. The different categories of tremor usually have very different causes.</p><p>More detailed information about tremor is available by subscription.

If that is the cause of your tremor, your healthcare provider will probably focus on treating the Parkinson disease in the hopes that doing so will also alleviate the tremor.</p><p>In a few instances, people with Parkinson disease who have a rest tremor also have an action tremor. A detailed discussion of the treatment options for Parkinson disease appears elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-treatment-options-medications-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Parkinson disease treatment options &mdash; medications (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109723085\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other possible causes of rest tremor include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rubral tremor, caused by conditions that damage part of the brainstem</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wilson disease, a rare inherited disease that causes copper to build up in the body (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Diagnostic tests&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MOST COMMON CAUSES OF ACTION TREMOR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Everyone, even people who are healthy, has a little bit of shaking of the hands, especially when performing precise tasks, like threading a needle or focusing a camera. This type of shaking, known as physiologic tremor, is not usually noticeable because it is so mild that it is not visible under normal circumstances.</p><p>Under some circumstances, physiologic tremor becomes exaggerated and therefore visible. Common causes of this exaggeration include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medications, such as those used to treat asthma or other breathing problems, steroids (glucocorticoids), and some drugs used to treat neurologic or psychiatric disorders</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulants, such as caffeine and nicotine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety, excitement, fear, and other extreme emotions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle fatigue, which can happen after a challenging workout</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol or drug withdrawal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p>Physiologic tremors caused by problems such as those listed above usually go away when the underlying cause is addressed. If the physiologic tremor is caused by a medication, it may not be possible to eliminate the medication, but it may be possible to switch the medication or to lower the dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Essential tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Essential tremor is a neurologic problem that causes action tremor. Scientists do not understand what causes essential tremor, but they do know that it can be passed on within families.</p><p>Essential tremor can start at any time in life, sometimes as early as childhood. More commonly, essential tremor becomes noticeable in the young adult or later years. The tremor tends to affect the hands and arms and can affect one side (left or right) more than the other.</p><p>People who have essential tremor usually shake when they try to hold their arms outstretched and still. They also tend to shake when they are doing a goal-directed movement, such as writing, drinking from a glass of water, or touching their nose with their finger. In fact, the shaking tends to get worse as the person is about to reach his or her goal.</p><p>Essential tremor sometimes affects the head, resulting in a repeated &quot;yes-yes&quot; nod or a repeated &quot;no-no&quot; headshake. Usually, people who have these symptoms also have shaking in the hands or a tremor in the voice, although the head can be affected on its own. Rarely, the legs and upper body are affected.</p><p>Essential tremor is frequently called a &quot;benign&quot; tremor because it does not usually affect your ability to perform daily tasks. However, it can be severe enough in some people that it causes a serious limitation in lifestyle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other possible causes of action tremors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar tremors, caused by damage to a part of the brain called the cerebellum that helps to coordinate movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intention tremor (also called kinetic tremor), which typically increases in severity as the hand moves closer to its target and is due to disturbances along the pathways that connect the cerebellum to other parts of the brain; the most common causes are multiple sclerosis, brainstem trauma, and stroke</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary writing tremor, which occurs exclusively while writing and not during other voluntary movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthostatic tremor, which is limited to the legs and occurs only while standing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders affecting the nerves outside the brain that control muscle movement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety and other psychologic problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREMOR DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To determine what type of tremor you have and what might be causing it, your healthcare provider will need to ask you a list of detailed questions about your tremor. He or she will probably ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does your tremor happen when you are resting, when you stand still, when you hold your arms outstretched, or when you are moving?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there activities or circumstances that make the tremor better or worse?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which body parts are affected? Are the left and right side are equally affected?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When did the tremor start? Did the start time coincide with any other symptoms, starting new medications, or any injuries or illnesses?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does drinking alcohol affect the severity of your tremor? (Some types of tremor, particularly essential tremor, improve temporarily with alcohol.)</p><p/><p>Your description of the tremor and your healthcare provider's observations of the tremor hold the most important clues about your condition. Your healthcare provider may recommend brain scans or blood tests to rule out certain problems, but there are no conventional lab tests that can diagnose Parkinson disease or essential tremor, the two most common causes of tremor.</p><p>To diagnose these conditions, a healthcare provider must rely on old-fashioned medical sleuthing and skilled observation. That's why it's so important that you share as many details as possible, even if they seem unimportant to you.</p><p>During the examination, your healthcare provider may ask you to stand and hold your arms outstretched, or ask you to do other things that might elicit or worsen the tremor. For instance, he or she may ask you to touch your nose with one finger, or to show a sample of your handwriting. Seeing how the tremor changes under these circumstances can help determine what the cause of your tremor might be.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Lab tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because tremor is sometimes caused by another medical problem, your healthcare provider may recommend tests to check for one or more of those conditions. For example, he or she may order:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to measure thyroid hormone levels or to check for copper or other metals in the blood</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain scans to check for tumors, strokes, or other types of brain damage</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREMOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a tremor is caused by another medical problem, treating that problem (assuming it can be treated) sometimes helps alleviate the tremor, too. For example, people whose tremor is caused by excess thyroid hormone often stop shaking when their hormone levels are restored to normal.</p><p>Likewise, people whose tremor is caused by Parkinson disease sometimes improve when they begin treatment for the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-treatment-options-medications-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Parkinson disease treatment options &mdash; medications (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Essential tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Essential tremor occurs on its own and cannot be explained by other underlying health problems. Even so, treatments for essential tremor exist. In particular, the medications propranolol (sample brand names: Inderal, InnoPran XL) and primidone (brand name: Mysoline) may be effective in reducing essential tremor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If medications do not work well enough and the tremor is severe and disabling, a neurosurgical procedure called deep brain stimulation may be an option. This treatment requires surgery to place small electrical stimulators into the brain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of essential tremor&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=733\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
