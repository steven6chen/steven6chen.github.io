However, this view has been greatly modified since the 1987 discovery that the free radical NO is the previously uncharacterized endothelial-derived relaxing factor. It is now clear that NO plays an important role in most human organ systems.</p><p>Within the respiratory system, NO regulates vascular and bronchial tone (promoting dilation of both vessels and airways), facilitates the coordinated beating of ciliated epithelial cells, and acts as an important neurotransmitter for non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic neurons that run in the bronchial wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]. This molecule can be detected in exhaled gas as the fraction of exhaled NO (FE<sub>NO</sub>), which varies in health and disease.</p><p>The biology of NO, techniques available for measuring this gas in exhaled breath, and potential uses of these measurements in clinical practice will be reviewed here. The therapeutic use of inhaled NO is discussed separately.

Three such isoforms have been identified and are termed type I or neuronal cell NOS (nNOS), type II or inducible NOS (iNOS), and type III or endothelial cell NOS (eNOS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68181\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68181 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Although these enzymes are distinct proteins encoded by genes on disparate chromosomes, all three catalyze the adduction of the guanidino nitrogen of the amino acid arginine to molecular oxygen, yielding NO and water (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79786 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Regulation of NOS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the three isoforms of NOS catalyze the same reaction, regulation of the activity of these isozymes occurs through distinct processes. Both nNOS and eNOS are usually constitutively active and produce low amounts of NO, with output varying with changes in the intracellular calcium concentration. In contrast, iNOS binds calcium so avidly that its function is not influenced by calcium fluxes within the physiologic range. While not constitutively active in most settings, iNOS is constitutively expressed in the airway epithelium of normal and asthmatic subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. iNOS also has the capacity to generate large quantities of NO when transcriptionally upregulated by inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin 1 (IL-1)-beta, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-4, and IL-13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/9,10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,14</a>]. In vitro evidence suggests that this upregulation can be abolished by glucocorticoids in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Location of NOS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cellular location of the various NOS isoforms in the respiratory system has been investigated using immunohistochemical and DNA hybridization techniques. In the human lung, nNOS localizes to airway epithelium and likely to the submucosal nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], iNOS has been documented in airway epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and eNOS exists in the vascular endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The observation that iNOS is inducible by inflammatory cytokines and is inhibited by glucocorticoids provides circumstantial evidence that iNOS activity within airway epithelial cells is the source of the increased NO encountered in asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Source of exhaled NO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precise anatomic source of exhaled NO was not initially clear, because nitric oxide is formed by multiple mechanisms and in various types of cells. Early studies suggested that the NO in orally exhaled air was likely to represent contamination with NO derived from the sinuses, as the nasal sinuses contain very high levels of NO (&gt;1000 ppb) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. However, subsequent studies using bronchoscopic techniques to isolate the lower airway from nasal gas have demonstrated that the concentrations of NO in gas derived exclusively from the lower airway are comparable to those obtained in the orally exhaled breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Thus, it is now accepted that the majority of exhaled NO originates from the lower airways. Mathematical models using simultaneous high resolution recordings of FE<sub>NO</sub> and flow rate suggest that the majority of NO is excreted from the larger central airways and that central airway NO derives in large part from airway epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF NO IN THE AIRWAY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exhaled air of asthmatic individuals contains higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) than healthy non-smoking individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], but the exact role of NO in asthma is less clear and likely multifaceted. Some studies suggest that increased NO relaxes bronchial smooth muscle leading to bronchodilatation and inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], while others suggest it contributes to airway inflammation and injury through formation of toxic reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>NO is highly reactive and once produced it can rapidly lead to the formation of several nitric oxide related end products with differing downstream effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/23,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,32</a>]. Increased production of NO or RNS may increase nitration of tyrosine residues in proteins or decrease nitrosylation of thiol residues on proteins, which in turn decreases the bronchodilating S-nitrosothiols (SNO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/23,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,32</a>]. A model of NO dynamics derived from allergen challenge studies in humans demonstrates that NO may have harmful effects through formation of peroxynitrite (one of the reactive nitrogen species), but may also have an antioxidant role by consuming reactive oxygen species during the immediate asthmatic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Ultimately, the functional role of NO, as with any molecule, depends on both its concentration and association with other biomolecules and proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASUREMENT OF EXHALED NO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemiluminescence analysis allows determination of nitric oxide (NO) concentration in the gas phase by the reaction of NO in the sample with ozone to produce nitrogen dioxide in an excited state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As nitrogen dioxide moves to a relaxed state, light is emitted in a stoichiometric relationship with the amount of NO present in the gas sample. Most initial studies reported in the literature used ozone-chemiluminescence to measure exhaled NO concentrations, and this technology was used in the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Subsequently, devices based on other technologies, including hand held devices utilizing electrochemical methods, have also been approved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Standardized methods for measuring exhaled NO were jointly developed by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory society (ERS) in 1999 and revised in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. The guidelines recommend the use of the term FE<sub>NO</sub> (the fractional exhaled NO concentration) to describe the level of NO in exhaled breath. FE<sub>NO</sub> is expressed in parts per billion which is equivalent to nanoliters per liter. </p><p>Exhaled NO can be measured online, while the subject exhales directly into the analyzer, or offline, by collection of exhaled air in an NO-impervious container and later measurement. Important technical factors include exclusion of nasal NO, use of proper procedures for online or offline measurement, adherence to optimal expiratory flow rates, and monitoring ambient NO levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Key features of the technique are reviewed here. The full guideline, including information about optimizing NO measurement in special populations (eg, children), is available at <a href=\"https://www.thoracic.org/statements/&amp;token=Pby/nGkMB8TdW5V6epNUr3SRsNf6YBT3Fr3MIDgZvpZGvZXjM5qSgaeGcxqQwZtc&amp;TOPIC_ID=542\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Thoracic Society Statements</a>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Online measurements</strong> &ndash; For online measurements obtained while the subject exhales at a constant flow directly into the analyzer, the mean FE<sub>NO</sub> value over a three-second plateau is recorded, not the early peak. In order to achieve an appropriate plateau, the duration of exhalation must be sufficient (at least four seconds for children &lt;12 years and more than six seconds for children &ge;12 years and adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Offline measurements</strong> &ndash; Specifications include using an apparatus to collect exhaled air without loss of NO; depleting the inspiratory air of NO prior to inhalation; and maintaining an expiratory flow rate of 0.350 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/second</span> (range 0.315 to 0.385 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/second)</span> throughout exhalation. Sometimes the first 150 to 250 mL of exhaled air is discarded but the optimal volume is not known and this step requires special valves. As with on-line measurements, the actual flow rate should be recorded with the test results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exclusion of nasal NO</strong> &ndash; Exclusion of nasal NO is important as these levels are high relative to lower respiratory tract levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In general, a nose clip is not used as this may allow nasal NO to accumulate and leak into the posterior pharynx. On the other hand, if the patient is not able to avoid nasal inspiration, a nose clip may be used. After inserting the mouthpiece, the patient inhales through the mouth to total lung capacity and immediately exhales completely to avoid breath holding. In addition, having the subject maintain a positive mouthpiece pressure of about 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (but not above 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) during exhalation helps to close the velopharyngeal opening and further minimize nasal NO leakage. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Expiratory flow rate</strong> &ndash; Exhaled NO levels are dependent on the expiratory flow rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], so a constant exhalation rate of 0.050 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/second</span> is preferred for online measurements and a rate of 0.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/second</span> for offline measurements (as noted above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Acceptable methods to achieve a constant flow rate include a visual display of the target flow rate while the patient exhales against a fixed resistance, use of a dynamic resistor, and operator controlled flow rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In any case, the flow rate should be recorded with the test results.</p><p/><p>The ambient NO level should be recorded at the time of testing, as this level can also influence the test results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE IN ASTHMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large body of research has examined the potential role of the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FE<sub>NO</sub>) as a noninvasive biomarker in asthma. It has been hoped that using FE<sub>NO</sub>, rather than just symptoms or airflow limitation, would help in asthma diagnosis, characterization of asthma in individual patients (eg, eosinophilic or noneosinophilic), guidance regarding selection and adjustment of asthma therapy, and advancement of our understanding of the effects of medications on airway inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/39-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-50</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15447321\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation of exhaled NO in asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial studies of FE<sub>NO</sub> in asthma used reference ranges to define normal and abnormal values. However, it has been difficult to determine appropriate reference ranges as healthy individuals sometimes fall outside the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; range and individuals with asthma occasionally fall within the range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-55</a>]. Rather than develop reference ranges based on the varied combinations of these characteristics, a simpler method of using cut-points has been proposed in the American Thoracic Society Clinical Practice Guideline for interpretation of FE<sub>NO</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A FE<sub>NO</sub> less than 25 ppb in adults and less than 20 ppb in children younger than 12 years of age implies the absence of eosinophilic airway inflammation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A FE<sub>NO</sub> greater than 50 ppb in adults or greater than 35 ppb in children suggests eosinophilic airway inflammation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Values of FE<sub>NO</sub> between 25 and 50 ppb in adults (20 to 35 ppb in children) should be interpreted cautiously with reference to the clinical situation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rising FE<sub>NO</sub> with a greater than 20 percent change and more than 25 ppb (20 ppb in children) from a previously stable level suggests increasing eosinophilic airway inflammation, but there are wide inter-individual differences</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decrease in FE<sub>NO </sub>greater than 20 percent for values over 50 ppb or more than 10 ppb for values less than 50 ppb may be clinically important</p><p/><p>Once the clinical setting is taken into consideration, certain patterns begin to emerge. FE<sub>NO </sub>levels above 50 ppb correlate with glucocorticoid responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], while levels below 25 ppb can predict a lack of responsiveness to addition of inhaled glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In a glucocorticoid naive individual with symptoms, FE<sub>NO </sub>levels above 20 to 25 ppb may support the presence of asthma, while lower levels are not likely to be associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation and thus not likely to respond to addition of inhaled glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. However, several factors have been identified that affect FE<sub>NO</sub> values other than asthmatic inflammation, such as age, sex, atopy, and cigarette smoking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57833 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The two main factors that need to be taken into consideration while interpreting FE<sub>NO</sub> are smoking (associated with lower FE<sub>NO</sub> levels) and atopy (associated with higher FE<sub>NO</sub> levels).
