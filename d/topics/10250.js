Although an adequate level of immunosuppression is required to dampen the immune response to the allograft, the level of chronic immunosuppression is decreased over time (as the risk of acute rejection decreases) to help lower the overall risk of infection and malignancy; these risks directly correlate with the degree of overall immunosuppression.</p><p>The optimal maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation is not established. The major immunosuppressive agents that are available in various combination regimens are glucocorticoids (primarily oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF), enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (in nonmodified or modified [microemulsion] form), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>, rapamycin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=belatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">belatacept</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Conventional maintenance regimens consist of a combination of immunosuppressive agents that differ by mechanism of action.

This effect is not observed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>.

If tacrolimus is substituted for cyclosporine in a patient concurrently taking mycophenolate, we frequently decrease the dose of mycophenolate by 50 percent. Although the use of tacrolimus compared with cyclosporine increases MMF exposure by 20 to 30 percent, we believe that a 50 percent reduction is appropriate since, compared with a 25 percent reduction, it may be associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects and anemia, and it may also limit the costs of an enhanced pill burden.

We prefer extended-release tacrolimus tablets rather than immediate-release formulations because of equal efficacy and fewer adverse effects (eg, tremor, alopecia, and neurotoxicity). We initiate extended-release tacrolimus tablets on postoperative day 1 at 0.08 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> once per day, with doses adjusted to achieve a 12-hour trough level of 7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> for the first month and 3 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> thereafter. (See <a href=\"#H106706971\" class=\"local\">'Selection of a calcineurin inhibitor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among the available antimetabolic agents, we suggest the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> (MMF or EC-MPS) rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Despite its increased cost, mycophenolate is preferred over azathioprine because of its superior ability to prevent acute rejection and its better side effect profile. However, mycophenolate is teratogenic, and we do <strong>not </strong>use mycophenolate in female recipients of childbearing age unless they are on long-acting contraception, have undergone surgical sterilization procedures, or have absolute infertility. Thus, in these patients, we prefer to use azathioprine. (See <a href=\"#H980190140\" class=\"local\">'Selection of an antimetabolic agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">We prefer EC-MPS over MMF because EC-MPS is similar in efficacy and safety and may be associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects among certain groups of patients. We administer EC-MPS at 360 mg orally upon inpatient admission to the floor. Postoperatively, we give EC-MPS at 720 mg orally twice daily until a therapeutic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> level is achieved, then we decrease EC-MPS to 360 mg orally twice daily. (See <a href=\"#H310834638\" class=\"local\">'Mycophenolate mofetil versus mycophenolate sodium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> at 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum of 500 mg) intravenously in the operating room, then initiate oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (maximum dose of 80 mg) for the first three days posttransplant, which is then lowered to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for the first week. The daily dose is then tapered every week by 5 mg, resulting in 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for one week, 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for one week, and then 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. In the absence of acute rejection, we generally reduce glucocorticoids to a dose of 5 mg per day by one month following kidney transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H177628256\" class=\"local\">'Dosing of glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In renal transplant recipients who are <strong>not</strong> considered to be at high risk for acute rejection, we administer a maintenance regimen consisting of triple immunosuppression therapy with a calcineurin inhibitor, an antimetabolite, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. This approach is similar to the one we use for patients considered to be at high risk for acute rejection. (See <a href=\"#H930471694\" class=\"local\">'Initial maintenance immunosuppression in low-risk patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Exceptions to our approach include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In Caucasian recipients of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) two-haplotype-identical, living, related allografts, we use triple therapy for the first three to six months posttransplant, then switch to dual therapy with glucocorticoids plus an antimetabolite (EC-MPS or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In black, two-haplotype-identical, living, related recipients, we use triple therapy with glucocorticoids, an antimetabolite, and low-dose calcineurin inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> troughs of 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> troughs of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recipients of HLA-identical allografts from a monozygotic twin can be treated with immunosuppression for one to three months. They are subsequently maintained without immunosuppressive medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most renal transplant recipients, a stable maintenance immunosuppression regimen is established within the first three months after transplantation. After three months, we do not routinely reduce maintenance immunosuppression, even among stable patients. Complete withdrawal of all maintenance therapy is <strong>not</strong> recommended (except in recipients of HLA-identical allografts from a monozygotic twin), since it frequently leads to late acute rejection or accelerated chronic rejection. Some patients may require a modification of the initial maintenance immunosuppression regimen due to the development of posttransplant complications (eg, toxicity, allograft failure, acute rejection, infection, cancer) or other clinical events (eg, pregnancy, surgery).
