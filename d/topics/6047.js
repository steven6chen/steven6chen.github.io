The first transvenous EMB forcep, the Konno-Sakakibara bioptome, was developed in Japan in 1962 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A modified bioptome, the Caves-Schultz-Stanford bioptome, was developed in 1972, and versions of this device are still widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Flexible bioptome devices with smaller jaws have been developed and are associated with very low complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Declines in the procedural risk of EMB and increasing evidence of its value in diagnosis and guiding therapy are extending the role for EMB at medical referral centers with necessary technical expertise.</p><p>Monitoring for allograft rejection after cardiac transplantation is the strongest indication for EMB (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cardiac allograft rejection: Diagnosis&quot;</a>). The role for this procedure in other disorders, such as myocarditis and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, has been more controversial.</p><p>The general role of EMB in cardiovascular disease will be reviewed here. The importance of EMB in individual diseases will be discussed in detail in the appropriate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6476041\"><span class=\"h2\">Access and imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) was initially performed via the internal jugular vein and the right internal jugular vein remains the most common access site in the United States. However, the advent of long, flexible bioptome devices permits a femoral venous approach with equal efficacy.</p><p>EMB is usually performed with fluoroscopic guidance. Transthoracic echocardiography is increasingly used in conjunction with fluoroscopy in an effort to reduce the risk of cardiac perforation. Echocardiography also allows visualization of biopsy location, which is important to confirm that the same site is not repeatedly biopsied and for conditions such as intracardiac mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28739986\"><span class=\"h2\">Right or left ventricle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EMB specimens are usually obtained from the right ventricle (RV). Biopsy of the RV septum has the advantage of posing a relatively low risk of cardiac perforation and, unlike left ventricular (LV) biopsy, it carries no risk stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Either a femoral or internal jugular venous approach may be used. The major limitation is sampling error, particularly for diseases that are patchy and primarily affect the left ventricle. </p><p>LV biopsy is rarely performed but can be obtained via an arterial approach. Indications for LV biopsy include suspected cardiac sarcoidosis or myocarditis with primary LV involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A two-center study found that biventricular biopsy provided an incremental diagnostic yield over RV biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. 755 patients with suspected myocarditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonischemic cardiomyopathy underwent LV, RV, or biventricular EMB. Diagnostic EMB results were achieved more frequently in those undergoing biventricular EMB (79.3 percent) compared with those undergoing univentricular EMB (67.3 percent). In patients undergoing biventricular EMB, myocarditis was diagnosed by LV EMB in 18.7 percent, by RV EMB in 7.9 percent, and in both ventricles in 73.4 percent. Biopsy in the region of late gadolinium enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging did not increase the yield of diagnosis. Complication rates were similar for LV and RV biopsy.</p><p>A study reported safety and diagnostic data from the largest published case series of LV biopsies. A total of 4221 patients underwent EMB: 1153 LV EMBs, 672 RV EMBs, and 2369 both LV and RV EMBs. The overall risk of major complications was low (0.33 percent for LV EMB and 0.45 percent for RV EMB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sampling and analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the following recommendations regarding EMB sampling and analysis based upon the 2007 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/European</span> Society of Cardiology scientific statement on the role of EMB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and the 2011 consensus statement on EMB from the Association for European Cardiovascular Pathology and the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Samples should be obtained from more than one region of the RV septum, and the number of samples should range from 5 to 10, depending upon the studies to be performed and size of the bioptome forceps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least four to five samples should be submitted for light microscopic examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a glutaraldehyde-based fixative is recommended if a storage disease, anthracycline, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> cardiotoxicity is suspected.

The first is the anticipated yield of the procedure, given the presumed prebiopsy probability of a given disorder as well as the risk of sampling error (ie, not obtaining diagnostic samples from a diseased heart due to the patchy nature of disease). The second major consideration is the perceived availability of effective therapy for the diagnosis that is obtained. EMB is recommended in clinical scenarios in which the unique prognostic and diagnostic value of the information gained is felt to outweigh the procedural risks. </p><p>The diagnostic yield of a clinical evaluation that included EMB using exclusively histologic criteria (Dallas criteria) was retrospectively evaluated in a series of 1230 patients with an initially unexplained cardiomyopathy in which the following etiologies were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic &ndash; 50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocarditis &ndash; 9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic heart disease &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltrative disease &ndash; 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripartum cardiomyopathy &ndash; 4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension &ndash; 4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV infection &ndash; 4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Connective tissue disease &ndash; 3 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance abuse &ndash; 3 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxorubicin</a> &ndash; 1 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other &ndash; 10 percent</p><p/><p>Although a clinical diagnosis was established in 50 percent, a specific histologic diagnosis from EMB (mostly myocarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66465\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66465 \">picture 1</a>) and infiltrative disease) was obtained in only 15 percent of patients. This relatively low rate may be due in part to sampling error. </p><p>However, the diagnostic and prognostic value of EMB was likely underestimated by the above data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The study did not include use of immunohistochemical and molecular techniques of viral genome analysis, which have led to substantially increased diagnostic yield compared with conventional histopathological evaluation (Dallas criteria). In addition, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) or endocardial voltage mapping may further increase the yield of EMB by identifying regions with inflammation for sampling in specific disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Limited data are available on the efficacy of therapy guided by immunohistochemical and molecular EMB analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>]. </p><p>In summary, the data suggest that the yield of therapeutically relevant information provided by EMB using histologic criteria (Dallas criteria) is low in the general heart failure (HF) population. Additional techniques such as immunohistochemistry and viral genome analysis can augment the diagnostic value of EMB in chronic unexplained cardiomyopathy, but limited data are available on therapy guided by such analysis. Therefore, patients with HF or cardiomyopathy should generally undergo a comprehensive evaluation, with EMB limited to those with specific indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The main value of EMB is in the diagnosis of certain uncommon myocardial disorders, such as giant cell myocarditis, that have unique prognoses and treatment and cannot be diagnosed by less invasive tests. Other special situations where EMB may provide unique information include disorders associated with hypereosinophilia, sarcoidosis, certain restrictive and infiltrative cardiomyopathies, and other types of myocarditis. </p><p>In patients with a strong indication for EMB, a repeat EMB procedure may be required if the first procedure is non-diagnostic. As an example, in a series of patients with giant cell myocarditis, the sensitivity of EMB increased from 68 percent after a single EMB procedure (with multiple samples) to 93 percent after two or three EMB procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Given the limited available evidence, recommendations in the 2016 American Heart Association Scientific statement on the Management of Specific Cardiomyopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and the 2007 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/European</span> Society of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC/ESC)</span> scientific statement regarding the use of EMB were based mainly on expert opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The clinical scenarios below have been adopted with modifications from these statements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6475226\"><span class=\"h2\">EMB recommended</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6474546\"><span class=\"h3\">Fulminant HF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EMB is recommended in patients with unexplained new-onset HF of less than two weeks&rsquo; duration associated with a normal-sized or dilated left ventricle with hemodynamic compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/9,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21</a>]. In this setting, EMB may help establish prognosis and guide therapy. Since the cause of fulminant HF, such as giant cell myocarditis, may be missed on initial right ventricular EMB, if the results of the first EMB are inconclusive or discordant with clinical findings, then we suggest a re-biopsy or left ventricular EMB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Patients with lymphocytic myocarditis have an early fulminant course but an excellent prognosis. Necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis may also present with a fulminant course but has a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Giant cell myocarditis (GCM) has traditionally had a poor prognosis but combined immunosuppressive therapy has been associated with improved outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. When mechanical circulatory support is anticipated, a diagnosis of GCM may lead to use of a biventricular device because of the likelihood of progressive right ventricular failure and to an early heart transplant listing.

Although the sensitivity of EMB in cardiac sarcoidosis is low (eg, 20 percent), EMB may help distinguish sarcoidosis from GCM, which has diagnostic and therapeutic implications. However, the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis can be made without EMB if clinical features are suggestive and non-caseating granulomas are identified elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58910 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac sarcoidosis and GCM have similar rates of ventricular arrhythmias and heart block but sarcoidosis is associated with a more chronic course and better prognosis. Sarcoidosis may respond to glucocorticoid therapy, whereas combination immunotherapies have been used to treat GCM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;, section on 'Giant cell myocarditis'</a>.)</p><p>Support for EMB in patients with chronic (&gt;6 months) dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) unresponsive to conventional therapy comes from a randomized trial of 85 patients with EMB evidence of virus-negative myocarditis (inflammation present by immunohistology and viral genomes absent by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The patients were randomly assigned to a regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or to placebo.

This scenario is suggestive of hypersensitivity myocarditis (HSM), which is associated with a wide range of presentations. However, drug hypersensitivity may manifest as HSM, GCM, granulomatous myocarditis, or necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis. EMB is reasonable when drug hypersensitivity is suspected, as it may help distinguish HSM from GCM and necrotizing myocarditis, both of which are associated with poor prognosis. Early diagnosis of HSM may lead to withdrawal of offending medications and administration of high-dose glucocorticoids.

Although EMB is considered to be the most sensitive and specific method for evaluating anthracycline cardiotoxicity, it is reserved for situations in which the cause of cardiac dysfunction is uncertain, selected cases in which administration of greater than the usual upper limit of an agent is being considered, or clinical studies of toxicity of newer agents and regimens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, monitoring, and diagnosis of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Restrictive cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EMB is suggested in selected patients with HF associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy if other work-up is inconclusive. </p><p>Patients with HF symptoms associated with preserved systolic function should undergo evaluation to determine whether restriction or constrictive pericarditis is present. Potentially reversible causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy, such as amyloidosis or hemochromatosis, may be suggested by associated clinical features and noninvasive imaging. Distinctive features of these disorders may be noted on echocardiographic or CMR. If other evaluation is inconclusive, EMB may reveal a specific infiltrative disorder (eg, amyloidosis) or storage disease (eg, hemochromatosis) or myocardial fibrosis and myocyte hypertrophy consistent with idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiating constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Selected cardiac tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EMB is suggested for diagnosis of select cardiac tumors. Due to the risk of embolization, EMB should not be performed if features are suggestive of myxoma.</p><p>Cardiac tumors are generally identified and characterized by noninvasive imaging (eg, echocardiography, CMR, and computed tomography). Initial evaluation includes distinguishing tumor from cardiac structures, artifact, and thrombus. Surgical resection allows definite diagnosis from examination of the operative specimen. Occasionally, EMB-directed tissue diagnosis obviates the need for surgical resection (eg, lymphoma). </p><p>The diagnostic yield and potential risks of EMB in this setting are not well defined because data are limited. In selected cases, EMB is suggested for diagnosis of a cardiac tumor. EMB is reasonable if the potential benefit from the procedure outweighs the potential risk with the following conditions: (1) artifact or normal variants have been excluded as potential causes for a tumor-like appearance, (2) the diagnosis cannot be established by noninvasive imaging, (3) it is unclear if surgical resection is indicated, (4) tissue diagnosis can be expected to influence the course of therapy, (4) the chances of successful EMB are believed to be reasonably high, and (5) the procedure is performed by an experienced operator. Guidance with transthoracic, transesophageal, or intracardiac echocardiography is advised; selection of imaging modality depends on tumor location and characteristics. Since myxomas can embolize with manipulation, we recommend against EMB if the tumor has features typical of a myxoma.

(See <a href=\"#H5047341\" class=\"local\">'ARVC'</a> below.)</p><p>A retrospective study found that early EMB in 40 children presenting with DCM and acute HF identified 14 individuals with myocarditis. Ten individuals with myocarditis responded to medical therapy and could be managed without heart transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Most myocarditis in children is presumed to be viral; various viruses have differing histopathologic findings and may be identified by PCR. Such identification may have prognostic value. Data are limited, so the assessment of EMB as reasonable in this setting is based upon expert opinion.

Although an expert panel on myocarditis suggested broadening the indications for EMB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], the therapeutic impact of wider use of EMB is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Recent onset DCM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EMB is not generally indicated in patients with unexplained new onset HF of two weeks to three months&rsquo; duration associated with a DCM, without new ventricular arrhythmias or Mobitz type II second-degree AV block, or third-degree AV block, that responds to usual care within one to two weeks.</p><p>The utility of EMB in this setting is uncertain since many patients with this presentation improve with standard HF therapy. The prevalence of a pathologic diagnosis of lymphocytic myocarditis using exclusively the histologic criteria (Dallas criteria) has varied widely (0 to 63 percent) in this setting. Of note, the risk of death or heart transplantation in lymphocytic myocarditis with two weeks or more of symptoms and lack of viral prodrome is greater than in fulminant lymphocytic myocarditis described above in Clinical scenario 1. </p><p>EMB is not recommended for the routine evaluation of patients with recent onset DCM that is responsive to usual care. EMB in this setting is under investigation in certain specialized tertiary referral centers where immunohistochemistry and viral PCR are frequently performed to determine etiology and guide therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/13-15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;, section on 'Lymphocytic myocarditis'</a>.)</p><p>DCM has been associated with a wide range of viruses including enteroviruses, adenoviruses, parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus 6, HIV, and hepatitis C. EMB with combined histology (Dallas criteria), immunohistochemical, and molecular techniques of viral genome analysis is the gold standard to achieve etiopathogenetic diagnosis of viral versus autoreactive (virus-negative) inflammatory heart muscle disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/13-15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15,19</a>]. However, the efficacy of etiology-directed therapy in this setting is uncertain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic DCM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EMB is not generally indicated in patients with unexplained HF of more than three months&rsquo; duration associated with a DCM without new ventricular arrhythmias or Mobitz type II second-degree AV block, or third-degree AV block, that responds to usual care within one to two weeks.</p><p>Limited data are available on the efficacy of treatment guided by EMB analysis in patients with chronic DCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>]. Some patients with symptomatic HF after six months of optimal therapy may show improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction after immunosuppressive therapy, but more data are needed. The use of EMB to guide risk stratification and therapy in patients with chronic DCM is under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/13-15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15,19</a>].

When noninvasive testing is nondiagnostic, EMB can be useful. Treatment of iron overload can reverse ventricular dysfunction.

Some patients with unexplained arrhythmias (supraventricular or ventricular) have myocarditis, and myocarditis may present as unexplained life-threatening arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, the yield of EMB is low using Dallas criteria.

We recommend against performing EMB in this setting; this recommendation is consistent with the 2007 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC/ESC</span> scientific statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions regarding use of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) should include consideration of the complications associated with the procedure.</p><p>The risks of EMB include myocardial perforation with pericardial tamponade, arrhythmias, heart block, pneumothorax, arterial puncture, pulmonary embolization, nerve block or injury, hematoma, damage to the tricuspid valve, creation of arteriovenous fistula, and deep venous thrombosis. Reported complication rates range from less than 1 to as high as 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p>The overall safety of EMB was validated in a series of nearly 6800 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The incidence of complications was 1.2 percent, with perforation occurring in 0.42 percent and death in 0.03 percent. The risk of myocardial perforation rises with the severity of left ventricular (LV) dilatation. Myocardial perforation can usually be managed conservatively with careful clinical and echocardiographic monitoring. Pericardiocentesis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thoracotomy is required in selected cases, and death is rare.</p><p>A single-center experience of right ventricular (RV) EMB via the femoral venous approach to evaluate unexplained LV dysfunction also demonstrated low complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The modified Cordis bioptome used is significantly more flexible and has smaller jaws than the standard Stanford-Caves bioptome. Retrospective study of 1919 patients undergoing 2505 EMB procedures and prospective study of 496 patients undergoing 543 EMB procedures revealed no patient deaths and no complications requiring emergency cardiac surgery. Major complications such as cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis or complete atrioventricular block requiring permanent pacing were very rare (0.12 percent total in the retrospective study and none in the prospective study). Minor complications such as pericardial effusion, conduction abnormalities, or arrhythmias occurred in 0.20 percent in the retrospective study and 5.5 percent in the prospective study.</p><p>In a study of 755 patients undergoing LV, RV, or biventricular EMB, LV EMB and RV EMB resulted in similar major complication rates (0.64 versus 0.82 percent, respectively) and similar minor complication rates (0.64 to 2.89 percent versus 2.24 to 5.10 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endomyocardial-biopsy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>A complication that is primarily seen in cardiac transplant recipients who undergo repeated surveillance biopsies is development of tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR). The TR is usually well tolerated but valve repair or replacement is occasionally required.
