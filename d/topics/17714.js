GVHD occurs when immune cells transplanted from a non-identical donor (the graft) recognize the transplant recipient (the host) as foreign, thereby initiating an immune reaction that causes disease in the transplant recipient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>GVHD has been classically divided into acute and chronic variants based upon the time of onset using a cutoff of 100 days. However, this conventional division has been challenged by the recognition that signs of acute and chronic GVHD may occur outside of these designated periods. This observation has led to the increased use of clinical findings, rather than a set time period, to differentiate between acute and chronic GVHD. The widely accepted National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria for the diagnosis of GVHD include an overlap syndrome in which diagnostic or distinctive features of chronic GVHD and acute GVHD appear together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Clinical manifestations of chronic GVHD include skin involvement resembling lichen planus or the cutaneous manifestations of scleroderma; dry oral mucosa with ulcerations and sclerosis of the gastrointestinal tract; and a rising serum bilirubin concentration. In contrast, patients with acute GVHD commonly demonstrate a classic maculopapular rash; abdominal cramps with diarrhea; and a rising serum bilirubin concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical and histological manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Chronic GVHD is the single major factor determining long-term quality of life following HCT. Because of the profound immunosuppression observed with this disorder, recurrent infections occur in almost all affected patients. These complications account for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic GVHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quality of life following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Chronic graft-versus-host disease'</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will discuss the treatment of chronic GVHD.

However, each institution must have guidelines for the prevention and management of GVHD in order to be acknowledged by international accrediting organizations.</p><p>Multiple different regimens (eg, glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>) have been used in an attempt to prevent the development of chronic GVHD; most have been ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>]. Two potential exceptions are the use of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) as part of the preparative regimen and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in the post-transplant period. ATG is commonly incorporated into the prophylactic regimen for patients with an unrelated donor or haploidentical donor undergoing either myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning.

The addition of ATG significantly reduced the overall incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, without an increase in relapse or non-relapse mortality, and without compromising overall survival. However, addition of ATG did not significantly reduce the incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD or death within 100 days, the primary endpoints of the study. A subsequent report of this study demonstrated a lower incidence and severity of chronic GVHD without increasing the risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

After a median follow-up of 24 months, the addition of antilymphocyte globulin resulted in a lower cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (32 versus 69 percent) and a higher percentage of patients able to discontinue cyclosporine (91 versus 39 percent). Rates of acute GVHD, relapse-free survival, and overall survival at two years were similar between the two groups.

Prophylaxis of acute GVHD centers on immunosuppression of the donor cells, either pharmacologically or via T cell depletion. There is no agreed upon standard regimen, and clinical practice varies by institution. Commonly employed regimens include the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> plus a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil plus a calcineurin inhibitor.

Most treatment options are based on the immunosuppression of donor T cells, which are responsible for the clinical manifestations of GVHD. However, the same cells are likely responsible for an immunologic effect on the tumor. As such, treatment must aim to balance the benefit of reducing GVHD with the potential harm of decreasing a GVT effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease#H4622221\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Balancing GVHD and GVT effect'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The severity of chronic GVHD is determined by an assessment of the degree of organ involvement. Mild disease involves two or fewer <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/sites</span> with no clinically significant functional impairment.

All patients with chronic GVHD requiring systemic therapy should be encouraged to enroll on clinical trials. (See <a href=\"#H192886523\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below.)</p><p>For those who are not eligible for a clinical trial or who do not wish to participate in one, we offer the following guidance. While there is no agreed upon standard approach to the treatment of GVHD, corticosteroids remain the mainstay of initial treatment. Patients who develop chronic GVHD while receiving systemic glucocorticoids are treated with additional agents, such as those used for resistant disease. (See <a href=\"#H192886511\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of resistant disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Each institution must have guidelines for the management of GVHD in order to be acknowledged by the international accrediting organizations for transplant centers (Joint Accreditation Committee for ISCT Europe and EBMT [JACIE] and Foundation for the Accreditation of Cell Therapy [FACT]). Guidelines for the treatment of chronic GVHD have been proposed by the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; the British Committee for Standards in Hematology and the British Society for Bone Marrow Transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]; and the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and European LeukemiaNet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Patients may require extended courses of corticosteroids with treatment durations of two to three years and in some instances lifelong use of the lowest acceptable dose. The goal is to use the minimum amount of corticosteroid necessary to control symptoms. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> is usually started at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Prednisone is tapered further once symptoms are fully resolved. If symptoms progress at two weeks or improvement is not apparent by four to six weeks, therapy is escalated.

The thinning of the skin may also make it prone to ulceration, which combined with the sclerosis may impair healing. Emollients (ointments and creams) are frequently used, and a sauna suite may be especially helpful for those with very dry skin. Topical steroids, when used sparingly, are also helpful, as is topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>. Attention to areas of skin breakdown is very important to ensure that these sites do not become secondarily infected with microbes. Patients should be encouraged to use sun protection and to have an annual skin examination by a dermatologist with a low threshold for biopsying suspicious lesions.

Topical fluorides should be offered to prevent caries. Infection with herpes simplex virus, human papilloma virus, Candida, and other fungal organisms should be ruled out before initiating therapy. Topical steroids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a>) can be helpful in areas that have ulceration or leukoplakia due to GVHD. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-saliva-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Artificial saliva</a> has also been used but, in our experience, most patients prefer to carry a bottle of water and drink frequently. Patients with persistent or new oral lesions that occur greater than three months after HCT should be evaluated for secondary cancer involving the oral cavity. Stretching exercises may increase the range of motion of the mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Eyes</strong> &ndash; Dry eyes are very irritating, resulting in photophobia and significant pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Sunglasses can be helpful. For patients who produce tears, options include tear duct plugs and duct closure with laser treatment. The former tend to fall out frequently while the latter may be more permanent. Preservative-free <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> are often used for hydration, with steroids and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion for infections (eg, infectious keratitis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vagina</strong> &ndash; Vaginal dryness can be a common problem, especially in the setting of estrogen insufficiency. Sexual function should be addressed with specific questions aimed towards resolving issues. Vaginal stenosis is common and may require dilators. Early consultation with a gynecologist is warranted as early intervention with topical steroids and estrogen can minimize progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/30,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> &ndash; Patients may have difficulty swallowing and esophageal strictures can occur. Mechanical dilation (eg, Bougienage) may be used to break apart the strictures. Patients with diarrhea should have a standard evaluation including cultures, testing for Clostridium difficile toxin, cytomegalovirus cultures, and endoscopy. Occasionally, patients may have persistent diarrhea (steatorrhea) due to pancreatic insufficiency from chronic GVHD. Pancreatic replacement is beneficial in this setting.

Patients with chronic GVHD require screening for glucocorticoid-induced myopathy and sclerotic changes in the skin and fascia that can limit joint mobility. Physical and occupational therapy should be considered for patients with a decreased ability to perform activities of daily living. Repeated evaluation may be needed by a physical therapist to assess muscular weakness and range of motion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endocrine</strong> &ndash; Patients with chronic GVHD should be evaluated for accelerated bone loss.

Therefore, close attention should be paid to potential infections. Those with functional asplenia should be on penicillin for prophylaxis against encapsulated organisms.

The frequency of these assessments depends upon the comfort of the physician and patient and on the severity of disease. In general, we expect patients to have stable or improving disease within two weeks of therapy. For those with progression at two weeks or lack of response by four to six weeks, we consider the disease resistant and switch therapy.</p><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease have proposed comprehensive diagnostic, staging, and response criteria for chronic GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These measures are practical for use both by transplantation and non-transplantation medical providers, adaptable for use in adults and children, and focus on the most important chronic GVHD manifestations. </p><p>Based on these criteria, a proposed set of measures to be considered for use in clinical trials, as well as forms for data collection, have been provided and are available on the <a href=\"http://www.asbmt.org/&amp;token=uGGGJzyXPE4G4L0UBsgY9tbu+hmHQYad6RXLIhlZydg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=3550\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ASBMT website</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Measures should be made at three-month intervals and whenever major changes are made in treatment. Provisional definitions of complete response, partial response, and progression are proposed for each organ system and for overall outcomes. These response criteria have been validated in a prospective chronic GVHD observational trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192886511\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF RESISTANT DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192887995\"><span class=\"h2\">Adding a calcineurin inhibitor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily) is our initial treatment of choice for patients requiring systemic therapy for chronic GVHD. Additional therapy is warranted for patients with progression after two weeks of prednisone or lack of response by four to six weeks. The ideal therapy in this situation is not known, and patients should be encouraged to participate in a clinical trial. For those unable or unwilling to participate in a trial, we suggest the addition of a calcineurin inhibitor (eg, cyclosporin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>). (See <a href=\"#H192886523\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below.)</p><p>The calcineurin inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> have similar mechanisms of action, expected clinical effectiveness, and toxic effects, including hypomagnesemia, hyperkalemia, hypertension, and nephrotoxicity. Serious side effects include transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy and neurotoxic effects that can lead to premature discontinuation. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are nephrotoxic. As a result, other nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided, if possible, so that the agent can be delivered at the target doses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One option in this setting is the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every other day) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> twice daily alternating every other day with prednisone).

One possibility is that the agent simply replaces the more hydrophobic detergent and toxic bile acids. A more intriguing mode of action may be altered expression of HLA class I antigens on hepatocytes, thereby diminishing the immune attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192892168\"><span class=\"h3\">Interleukin-2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a T cell derived cytokine that plays a central role in immune responses. IL-2 is also important for the development and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Interest in the use of IL-2 in the management of GVHD was initially based upon mouse studies that suggested that Treg cells could control GVHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Regulatory T cells'</a>.)</p><p>In a phase I dose escalation study, 28 patients with glucocorticoid refractory chronic GVHD were treated with eight weeks of daily low-dose subcutaneous IL-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. At enrollment, patients were on a median of three concurrent agents for the management of GVHD. They had a median of three areas of GVHD involvement. The maximum tolerated dose of IL-2 was 1x10<sup>6</sup> international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span>. Higher doses produced persistent constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, and arthralgia). Severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4/5)</span> toxicities included thrombotic microangiopathy (two patients), infection (three patients), and myocardial infarction (two patients). None of the patients experienced a relapse of the underlying malignancy. Of the 23 patients who could be evaluated for response, 12 had a partial response and 11 had stable disease. Prolonged responses were seen in a subset of patients who chose to continue IL-2 for an extended period, many of whom were able to taper glucocorticoid dose.</p><p>A phase 2 trial of the same regimen in 35 adults with glucocorticoid refractory chronic GVHD reported clinical responses in 20 of 33 evaluable patients (61 percent, none complete) by week 12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Ten patients had stable disease and three had progressive disease. Following a mandatory four-week hiatus, 35 patients elected to resume injections and extended IL-2 therapy was continued long-term, allowing for glucocorticoid taper in some. Adverse events resulted in dose reduction in five patients and early withdrawal in two. The use of low-dose IL-2 was associated with an increase in regulatory T cells. &#160;</p><p>These results suggest that IL-2 administration is safe and may produce responses in chronic refractory GVHD.
