Patients admitted to tertiary palliative care units are likely to present with more frequent and severe symptoms compared with those admitted to community hospices or acute care hospital beds, although the frequency of symptoms is high in all groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79614\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79614 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Effective treatment will successfully alleviate, and may even eliminate, the majority of symptoms (pain, dyspnea, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> fatigue, etc) that arise in terminally ill patients.</p><p>Palliative care is an interdisciplinary medical specialty that focuses on preventing and relieving unnecessary suffering by supporting the best possible quality of life for patients and their families facing serious <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> life-threatening illness.&nbsp;The primary tenets of palliative care are symptom management; establishing goals of care that are in keeping with the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences; consistent and sustained communication between the patient and all those involved in his or her care; psychosocial, spiritual, and practical support both to patients and their family; and coordination across sites of care. Palliative care aims to relieve suffering in all stages of disease and is not limited to end of life care. Within an integrated model of medical care, palliative care is provided at the same time as curative or life-prolonging treatments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Referral to palliative care at an earlier stage of an advanced, serious or life-threatening illness may reduce the symptom burden of patients and prepare family caregivers for the last stages of life. In a seminal study of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, early palliative care consultation led to modest improvements in quality of life and mood, longer median survival, and less intravenous chemotherapy administered within 60 days before death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

However, the principles are equally applicable to patients with other advanced life-limiting diseases, such as heart failure, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), end-stage renal disease, and neuromuscular diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Symptom control issues in the terminal phase of illness that are unique to patients with heart failure and end-stage renal disease are discussed separately.

In addition, terminally ill patients are often frail and tolerate lower doses of drugs compared with other medically or psychiatrically ill patients.</p><p>The high frequency of autonomic nervous system failure increases the risk of some side effects from opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and phenothiazines, including constipation, dry mouth, nausea, urinary retention, and postural hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The presence of impaired cognition and use of opioids and other psychoactive drugs are all risk factors for delirium or sedation, both of which limit the ability of patients to function and interact with family and friends.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1779497\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Terminally ill patients often present with multiple symptoms and are frequently severely fatigued, distressed, and demoralized. Thus, symptom assessment should be simplified. A number of tools have been developed that allow for repeated assessment and graphically display the intensity of different symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These tools utilize descriptions of intensity using numbers, words, colors, fingers of the hand, or circles of gradually increasing size, and appear to be reliable. As an example, the revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) is a visual analogue scale that has been validated and utilized in multiple palliative care settings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65702\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65702 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-symptom-assessment-in-palliative-care#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to symptom assessment in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Assessment and rating instruments for symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Periodic symptom reassessment is valuable for identifying or modifying treatment goals, monitoring the response to specific symptomatic interventions, and communicating between members of the health care team.</p><p>Some symptoms have prognostic significance. Poor performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 3</a>), a measure of a patient&rsquo;s functional status, has been associated with a short survival in cancer patients. Other symptoms, such as weight loss, dyspnea, fatigue, and pain, have been also associated with poor prognosis in patients with advanced cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In addition, certain clinical signs, such as pulselessness of the radial artery, respiration with mandibular movement, decreased urine output, Cheyne-Stokes breathing, and the &ldquo;death rattle,&rdquo; strongly indicate imminent death within three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These signs, when present, provide health care providers with information that should be thoughtfully communicated to family members. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-symptom-assessment-in-palliative-care#H192146909\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to symptom assessment in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Performance status, symptoms, and prognosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life#H104832532\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: The last hours and days of life&quot;, section on 'Diagnosing dying'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of communication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open and regular communication with both the patient and family is essential to achieve adequate symptom palliation. They may have severe emotional, spiritual, and sometimes, financial distress. Information regarding findings, medications, and expected changes may need to be repeated several times by health care professionals. The use of graphs, question-prompt lists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], written material, or audiocassettes of consults can increase recall and satisfaction with information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Written materials such as brochures may improve communication between health care providers and patients, as well as their families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Written materials and audiotapes can also be used to inform family members who cannot be present for face-to-face discussions.</p><p>Breaking bad news can be difficult for physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Often, clinicians have the perception that disclosing prognostic information will result in depression, loss of hope, and even decreased survival, which is unfounded. Patients who have had end of life discussions do not have higher rates of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], loss of hope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], or decreased survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Open, honest, and empathetic communication is critical to providing palliative care, and guidelines have been developed to assist clinicians with this important task [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Benefits of more open and honest communication between cancer patients and health care providers include improved patient understanding and a more realistic estimate of survival, allowing patients to choose end of life care consistent with their own wishes and preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Family conferences can facilitate communication between patients and their caregivers. Results of prospective cohort trials in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting have shown that end of life family conferences are associated with improvement in family satisfaction, reduction in length of stay, and increased access to palliative care, without an increase in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Similar studies in other settings are lacking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=communication-in-the-icu-holding-a-family-meeting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Communication in the ICU: Holding a family meeting&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Health care providers need to take into consideration the information needs of both patients and their caregivers before engaging in discussions of end of life issues. Systematic interviews reveal that caregivers have distinct information needs concerning prognosis and other end of life issues, which often differ from those of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, preferences for information may change over time. As an example, one study found that patients with terminal cancer asked fewer questions about their diagnosis and, in general, were less involved with decision-making as their disease progressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Even if they have completed an advance directive, patients with a serious life-threatening illness often face challenging treatment choices, and high-quality discussions about what is important to them promote good decision-making and patient-centered care. Understanding the patient&rsquo;s values, preferences, and care goals in the context of a serious illness allows the clinician to align the care provided with what is most important to the patient. Discussing goals of care is a unique skill that should be separated conceptually from talking about prognosis or delivering bad news. While discussions about goals of care may involve some of the same principles as other difficult communication tasks, these discussions demand a different framework. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1780314\"><span class=\"h1\">FATIGUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue (asthenia, weakness) is the most common symptom in palliative care; it is also one of the most underdiagnosed and undertreated. Untreated or undertreated fatigue significantly affects the quality of life of patients receiving palliative care, and appropriate assessment and management of fatigue is essential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Overview of fatigue, weakness, and asthenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fatigue is typically a multidimensional symptom, often with multiple contributing causes. The major contributors to fatigue in patients with advanced cancer are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F86222\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86222 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Anemia is a particularly important contributor in patients undergoing cancer treatment. However, the importance of anemia is diminished towards the end of life for cancer patients and for others with nonmalignant serious <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> life threatening illnesses, in whom other contributing factors, such as psychological symptoms, including anxiety and depression, as well as pain, cachexia, side effects of medications, physical inactivity, and infection, may play a greater role. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia#H4310459\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Overview of fatigue, weakness, and asthenia&quot;, section on 'Causes and pathophysiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer-related fatigue: Prevalence, screening and clinical assessment&quot;, section on 'Main contributory factors'</a>.)</p><p>The assessment of fatigue in palliative care patients can be complex given its subjective and multidimensional nature. As such, there is a trend towards multidimensional assessment (ie, asking about different aspects of fatigue, such as muscular weakness or tiredness associated with a sleep disturbance) rather than asking a single question, &ldquo;Are you tired?&rdquo; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-symptom-assessment-in-palliative-care#H88107081\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to symptom assessment in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Fatigue'</a>.)</p><p>A comprehensive history and physical examination is indicated to identify potentially reversible etiologies. Review of all medications, including prescriptions, over the counter medications, and <span class=\"nowrap\">alternative/complementary</span> therapies, is particularly important to identify side effects and potential drug-drug interactions that may be contributing to fatigue. Simply altering the dose or dosing interval may substantially improve fatigue. Management of fatigue includes aggressive treatment of reversible causes, if any are identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F86231\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86231 \">table 5</a>). If a specific cause cannot be identified, symptomatic management is appropriate. All patients should be counseled as to coping strategies that conserve energy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73183\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73183 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53415\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53415 \">table 7</a>).</p><p>In the setting of palliative care, there are limited data to support one pharmacologic approach to fatigue over any other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For patients who are in the terminal phase of their illness who have a high symptom burden that includes fatigue, a two-week trial of a glucocorticoid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 20 to 40 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 4 to 8 mg every morning) is reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The role of psychostimulants is not well defined, particularly for patients with serious <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> life-threatening illnesses other than cancer. However, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> (eg, starting with 5 mg every morning and increasing, as needed, to 5 mg in the morning and at noon, 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg at noon, then 10 mg in the morning and at noon) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> is reasonable for patients with opioid-related sedation. Overall, studies have found that psychostimulants provide no significant improvement in cancer-related fatigue compared with placebo, but for patients with severe fatigue who do not respond to or who have a contraindication to a glucocorticoid, a brief trial may be warranted. Ginseng has also been shown to have the potential to improve cancer-related fatigue, although the results of studies have been mixed.

Pain affects approximately 80 percent of cancer patients before death. Fortunately, good or excellent pain control can be achieved in most cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-general-principles-and-risk-management-for-patients-receiving-opioids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain assessment and management in the last weeks of life&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In many cases, the constellation of symptoms and signs can suggest a specific cancer pain syndrome, such as metastatic bone involvement or a brachial plexopathy. The identification of such a syndrome may help to elucidate the etiology of the pain, direct the diagnostic evaluation, clarify the prognosis for the pain or the disease itself, and guide therapeutic intervention. If no etiology for the underlying pain syndrome is evident, clinicians should consider other patient-related factors, such as delirium, somatization, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Prior to prescribing opioids, screening for aberrant drug-taking behavior using tools such as the CAGE alcoholism screening questionnaire, the Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP), or the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) should be conducted in order for clinicians to avoid unnecessary opioid toxicity and appropriate psychosocial support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The term constipation has varied meanings for different people. For some, it may mean that stools are too hard or too small, or that defecation is too difficult or infrequent. The first three complaints are difficult to quantify in clinical practice; the last can be measured and compared with the general population.

The vast majority of cancer patients who die in acute care hospitals receive hydration until death, while most patients who die in hospice or at home receive no fluids. This is at least partly related to reimbursement issues.

The first step in treating depression is to relieve uncontrolled symptoms, particularly pain. For patients with major depression, supportive psychotherapy should be initiated, and sometimes, it is sufficient to treat the condition. However, most experts recommend an approach that combines supportive psychotherapy with patient and family education and judicious use of antidepressant medication. In general, clinicians should have a low threshold for pharmacologic treatment, even if the diagnosis is in question, because treatments for depression have become easier to use and tend to have fewer side effects than older medications. In terminal care, psychostimulants have a rapid onset of antidepressant action and are preferred by some clinicians over other agents, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that may take weeks to work.
