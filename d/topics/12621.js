There are four major types of EB, based upon the ultrastructural level of tissue cleavage in the skin: EB simplex, junctional EB, dystrophic EB, and Kindler syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76897\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76897 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Severity is determined by the level of blistering and type of mutation and is highly variable among subtypes of EB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F77709%7EDERM%2F67202%7EDERM%2F55262\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77709 graphicRef67202 graphicRef55262 \">table 2A-C</a>). </p><p>There is no targeted therapy for EB, although this is an active area of investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The management of patients with EB is largely supportive and includes wound care and prevention and treatment of complications. </p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the management of EB. The pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, and diagnosis of EB are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, classification, and clinical features of epidermolysis bullosa&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10204934\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70257089\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no specific therapy for most forms of epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Treatment is largely supportive and includes wound care, control of infection, nutritional support, and prevention and treatment of complications. </p><p>The management of patients with EB involves a multidisciplinary team usually composed of a dermatologist, an EB nurse with specialized expertise in wound care, primary care provider, occupational therapist, nutritionist, and social worker. Specialists, including gastroenterology, ophthalmology, nephrology, hematology, endocrinology, cardiology, pain management, psychiatry, genetics, plastic surgery, and specialized dentistry, are consulted as needed. This multidisciplinary approach is emphasized by the 2014 multicenter consensus recommendations for skin care in inherited epidermolysis bullosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Care plans for EB patients should be individualized according to age, severity, symptoms, complications, and patient priorities. We typically see patients with severe forms of EB, such as severe, generalized recessive dystrophic EB or junctional EB, at three- to six-month intervals; they often require inpatient multidisciplinary care. Patients with less severe forms of EB, such as localized EB simplex or mild dominant dystrophic EB, can be seen once a year in specialized outpatient clinics. </p><p>The burden for families with children with severe forms of EB is enormous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Support groups in the community, such as the <a href=\"http://www.debra.org/&amp;token=c8zehlRlllChWb7EVG9Nq75I4NnHKEzJpurIEqoL7cE=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15453\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association</a>, are important for families of children with this chronic, debilitating disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70257120\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory and imaging monitoring is an important aspect of management of patients with epidermolysis bullosa. Patients with EB require regular monitoring for complications and sequelae. The laboratory and imaging tests and the frequency of these tests vary depending upon the type of EB and the presence of complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87123\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87123 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56675661\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF NEONATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early management of neonates with EB should be undertaken in a neonatal or pediatric unit with the expertise, staffing, and resources necessary to manage extensive erosions or potential complications related to widespread skin sloughing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Expert nursing care is key to successful treatment of neonates with EB. Coordination of a multidisciplinary team involved in in-hospital management is essential and includes training parents and nonspecialist nurses at other centers and organizing the child's return home. They should not have heel prick tests performed at birth, as this carries the risk of degloving of the heel. Blood should be taken by venipuncture instead. </p><p>Newborns presenting with skin lesions suspicious of EB should be handled with extreme care. They should be placed on a thick foam pad and the pad should be used for transporting the infant (eg, from the bed to the caregiver's arms). Heat may induce blisters in some neonates with EB; the risks and benefits of using an incubator must be determined individually. </p><p>If suction is necessary, a soft catheter should be chosen and minimal suction pressure exerted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In newborns with severe dystrophic EB, over-zealous suction can strip the mucosa, resulting in scarring and earlier development of pharyngeal strictures.</p><p>It is preferable to delay bathing until lesions present at birth have healed. The erosions can be cleaned by gentle irrigation with warm sterile normal saline and covered with nonadherent dressings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Dressings are changed on one limb at a time to prevent self-inflicted trauma from kicking the bare skin on the opposite limb if the infant is agitated during the change. (See <a href=\"#H12936348\" class=\"local\">'Wound dressing'</a> below.)</p><p>Disposable diapers can be used but should be lined with a soft material to reduce trauma from the elastic edges. Erosions on the diaper area can be protected by liberal application of a mixture of white soft paraffin and liquid paraffin in equal parts or petrolatum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Specialized, nonadherent dressings (eg, Mepilex Transfer, Mepilex Lite) are also available for this purpose. More information is provided by <a href=\"http://www.debra.org/&amp;token=c8zehlRlllChWb7EVG9Nq75I4NnHKEzJpurIEqoL7cE=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15453\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">the patient support group website</a>. Clothing helps to prevent self-inflicted skin damage from kicking or rubbing. Clothes should be turned inside out to prevent skin damage from the seams.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13245661\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN AND WOUND CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12936341\"><span class=\"h2\">Bathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bathing is painful for patients with severe forms of EB and open wounds. In our clinical experience, pain is greatly reduced by bathing with salt water that approximates isotonic saline for bathing. For neonates, warmed bags of normal saline may be used in small baby bathtubs. Normal saline baths can also be prepared by dissolving approximately one kg (two pounds) of pool salt in a full tub (approximately 40 gallons [160 L]) of warm water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Pool salt is less expensive than table salt and available commercially. In one retrospective observational study including 21 patients (11 with recessive dystrophic EB), saltwater baths significantly reduced pain and pain medication use in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Reduction of body odor and skin exudate were additional beneficial effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12936348\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound dressing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonstick or nonadherent silicone dressings and foam dressings that absorb exudates are ideal as primary dressings for EB wounds. They can be covered with absorbent padding and left in place for several days. Using expensive nonstick dressings as a secondary layer is unnecessary, costly, and offers no additional benefit. Removal of adherent dressings can be facilitated by soaking in the bath, which is the easiest way to painlessly remove them. The recommended dressings for specific subtypes of EB are listed in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87148%7EDERM%2F87149%7EDERM%2F87150\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87148 graphicRef87149 graphicRef87150 \">table 4A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The frequency of change depends upon the patient's preference, time availability, amount of exudate, and presence of infection. Wounds with bacterial colonization or frank infection may require more frequent changes and specific types of dressings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87151\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87151 \">table 5</a>).

Wounds that are &quot;critically colonized&quot; (ie, active multiplication of organisms without invasion) or frankly infected fail to heal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. In addition to nonhealing, clinical signs of critical colonization include increased exudate, red, friable tissue, debris, and smell. Wounds that are frankly infected present with increased size and depth, <span class=\"nowrap\">erythema/edema</span> of surrounding skin, and increased exudate and smell. Systemic signs (eg, lymphadenopathy, fever, malaise) also may be present. </p><p>In critically colonized wounds, the bacterial load can be reduced with topical agents, including diluted bleach baths or compresses, topical antiseptics, and topical antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Bacterial cultures of critically colonized wounds are not routinely performed. If required, cultures should be obtained before starting topical antimicrobial treatments. </p><p>Bleach baths are prepared by diluting 100 mL of bleach in an adult-sized bath tub. Patients are soaked in the bath for 10 minutes and then rinsed with lukewarm water.</p><p>Topical antiseptic agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>, benzalkonium chloride, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver sulfadiazine</a>. However, prolonged use of silver preparations over large wounds may induce systemic silver toxicity (argyria) and a slate-gray metallic skin discoloration.

One month after grafting, epidermal regeneration was stable and complete. During a follow-up period of 21 months, the regenerated epidermis adhered firmly to the underlying dermis, even after induced mechanical stress, and did not form blisters.
