An alternative approach in this setting, particularly in patients with primary lack of responsiveness rather than drug intolerance or secondary failure due to loss of efficacy, is switching to another biologic agent with a different mechanism of action, rather than a second TNF inhibitor. In patients who have not been treated previously with &quot;triple therapy&quot; (the nonbiologic DMARD regimen of MTX, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> [HCQ], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> [SSZ]), this combination is another alternative that may be used, potentially concurrently with a TNF inhibitor in patients for whom the TNF inhibitor was judged to be partially effective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who do not respond adequately to the therapies above, including MTX and trials of one or two TNF inhibitors, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tofacitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tofacitinib</a>, an antirheumatic kinase inhibitor, in place of the TNF inhibitor (see <a href=\"#H99597930\" class=\"local\">'Resistant to two TNF inhibitors'</a> below).

Immediate switching to a second TNF inhibitor without a washout period appears safe and effective in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-biologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The available agents are similarly effective, and the specific agents, dosing, safety, and additional discussion of efficacy are presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-nonbiologic-dmard-therapy#H7011196\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to initial nonbiologic DMARD therapy&quot;, section on 'MTX plus TNF inhibitor'</a>). An inadequate response to one anti-TNF agent does not predict resistance to other agents in this class, although inefficacy and discontinuation rates increase with successive switches.

The FDA definition of a serious adverse event includes an adverse event associated with the use of a medical product that resulted in a life-threatening event, hospitalization, prolongation of a hospitalization, disability or permanent damage, a congenital anomaly or birth defect in a child of a parent using the medication, or an adverse event requiring intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.</p><p>Limited randomized trials, several large registry-based studies, and case series have demonstrated the benefit of switching from one biologic DMARD to another, if inefficacy or toxicity limits the use of a given agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-biologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/15-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-25</a>]. This is true both with switches from one to another TNF inhibitor and switches between classes of biologic agent.</p><p>The best data illustrating that switching to a second TNF inhibitor is effective after discontinuation of a first are from a randomized trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=golimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">golimumab</a> as the second agent, although there is less clinical experience with golimumab than with several of the other TNF inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-biologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In this trial, 461 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite prior use of at least one TNF inhibitor were randomly assigned to golimumab or placebo while continuing stable doses of baseline nonbiologic DMARDs (MTX, SSZ, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HCQ), glucocorticoids, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The prior TNF inhibitor could have been discontinued due to either ineffectiveness (58 percent) or other factors unrelated to effectiveness, including intolerance or inaccessibility (53 percent); some discontinued the first TNF inhibitor for multiple reasons. Among those who had discontinued the first TNF inhibitor due to lack of effectiveness, patients in the combined golimumab group (who received either 50 or 100 mg every four weeks) were significantly more likely to achieve an ACR (American College of Rheumatology)20 or higher response at week 14 (39 versus 18 percent). Patients who discontinued the first drug for reasons other than ineffectiveness were also more likely to achieve at least an ACR20 response with golimumab (34 versus 20 percent). There was no increase in serious adverse events in patients on golimumab compared with those on placebo. The results of this trial are consistent with findings from observational studies of other TNF inhibitors.</p><p>The relative benefits of switching to a second or a third TNF inhibitor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> [ETN], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>) were examined in a prospective observational study of 373 patients in the South Swedish Arthritis Treatment Group register [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-biologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. After three months of treatment, patients receiving their first compared with their second anti-TNF agent and patients receiving their second compared with their third anti-TNF agent were more likely to achieve an ACR20 (61 versus 51 versus 35 percent, respectively) or ACR50 response (37 versus 27 versus 18 percent, respectively). European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) overall response rates in the three groups were 76 versus 71 versus 58 percent.</p><p>One randomized trial has compared the use of a second TNF inhibitor with the use of any one of three other non-TNF-targeted biologic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-biologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], although no randomized trials have been performed to directly compare different pairs of individual biologic agents in patients who have had an inadequate response to a TNF inhibitor. In this trial, involving 300 patients with active RA resistant to an initial TNF inhibitor, patients were randomly assigned to receive either a non-TNF-targeted agent (non-TNF; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>) or a different TNF inhibitor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, certolizumab, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>). The choice of agent within the group of drugs to which the patient was randomized was made by the individual clinician caring for each patient. At week 24, a good or moderate EULAR response was significantly more frequent in the patients who received a non-TNF biologic (69 versus 52 percent, odds ratio [OR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.27-3.37). Limitations of the trial included lack of blinding, controls for co-interventions, and common or specified followup protocols; and a risk of bias in the outcome assessments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-biologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Results of indirect comparisons of different agents in this setting and observational studies are inconsistent. Indirect comparisons based upon data from the small number of available trials have not shown significant differences in benefit between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=golimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">golimumab</a> and biologic DMARDs from other classes (with which there are less experience in this setting), including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-biologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].
