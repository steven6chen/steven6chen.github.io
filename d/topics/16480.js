According to a 2015 national survey in the United States, approximately 8 percent of individuals age 12 or over had a diagnosable SUD in the past year, including about 6 percent with an alcohol use disorder and 3 percent with an illicit drug use disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Illicit drug use and nonmedical use of medications alone or in combination with alcohol are associated with a substantial proportion of emergency department visits in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A thorough substance use assessment includes a detailed inventory of the type, amount, frequency, and consequences of the patient's substance use, their perception of their use and readiness to change, an assessment of co-occurring psychiatric disorders, a medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests, the presence of substance use disorder in the patient's family, and review of social factors that may contribute to substance use or facilitate treatment.</p><p>The clinical assessment of substance use disorders is reviewed here. Screening for substance use is reviewed separately. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of SUDs specific to individual classes of substances are also reviewed separately.

The identification of comorbid medical conditions is a critical part in developing a treatment plan as they may impede recovery from substance use disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2997906588\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although laboratory tests of biologic samples (eg, urine, blood, sweat, hair, saliva, breath) have limited utility in making a substance use disorder diagnosis specifically, they can be used to detect recent drug use, and patients are more likely to answer questions related to use more honestly if an objective measure has been used. However, laboratory tests do not provide information on the frequency or intensity of use. For this reason, they may be more useful for monitoring abstinence repeatedly over time than for one-time assessment.</p><p>Basic biologic screens for addictive drugs used across the United States test for five drugs: amphetamine, cocaine, cannabis, some opioids, and phencyclidine. Many basic drug screens used in Australia, New Zealand, and much of the European Union and Asia omit phencyclidine but include tests for benzodiazepines and a wider range of opioids. Other drugs that may be tested for include barbiturates, methamphetamine, and synthetic opioids. Many widely used substances are not detected by routine addictive drug screening tests used in many locales, including alcohol (which can be detected by measuring ethyl glucuronide), synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones (&quot;bath salts&quot;); synthetic opioids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>; plant-derived substances such as hallucinogenic mushrooms; and other synthesized substances such as lysergic acid diethylamide. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testing-for-drugs-of-abuse-doa\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testing for drugs of abuse (DOA)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Urine drug screens are the most widely used type of test as they are inexpensive, easy to administer, and noninvasive. They can identify when there is a detectable concentration of the substance, but have limited utility to detect use other than recent. A table describes the period of detection for urine screens for common drug classes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58181\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58181 \">table 1</a>). For instance, the window of detection for amphetamines and cocaine is generally two to three days, while moderate to heavy marijuana use can be detected for up to one month. Blood toxicology tests, while accurate for detecting recent use, are used less frequently as they are more costly, less immediate, and more invasive than urine tests. Blood and breadth testing (the latter providing immediate results) can inform the extent of intoxication or at least the amount used, and can be useful with injured, cognitively impaired and unconscious patients.</p><p>Several laboratory tests have been used to help identify excessive substance use <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic damage and to monitor response to treatment over time.

(See <a href=\"#H561606501\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For each substance &ndash; principally, <span class=\"nowrap\">tobacco/nicotine,</span> alcohol, prescription medications and illicit drugs (opioids, stimulants, cannabis, <span class=\"nowrap\">sedative/hypnotics)</span> &ndash; the patient should be asked a few questions that determine ever used, pattern of use, last use, recent frequency (eg, once or twice a week, daily), and an indication of quantity to gather enough information to determine whether or not to assess for a substance use disorder for that particular substance. (See <a href=\"#H2509711790\" class=\"local\">'Type, frequency, and amount'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The co-occurrence of mental health and substance use disorders is well documented. A comprehensive mental health history and evaluation should identify past and current concurrent psychiatric disorders. A mental status exam typically would be unremarkable except in cases of current intoxication or withdrawal, when the patient is actively psychotic, and when chronic substance use has resulted in impaired cognitive function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dementia. (See <a href=\"#H1358701324\" class=\"local\">'Mental health'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance use can be associated with compromised functioning in virtually every system of the body. Medical conditions may develop as a result of the toxicity of the substance, route of administration, and high risk behaviors in which the patient engages (eg, needle sharing, unprotected sexual encounters, poor hygiene). (See <a href=\"#H1535317242\" class=\"local\">'General medical'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although laboratory tests of biologic samples (eg, urine, blood, sweat, hair, saliva, breath) have limited utility in making a substance use disorder diagnosis specifically, they can be used to detect recent drug use and patients are more likely to answer questions related to use more honestly if an objective measure has been used. (See <a href=\"#H2997906588\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A family history of substance use disorder (SUD) has been shown to be a risk factor, with genetic and environmental components, for the development of an SUD. Family environments in which a parent or primary caregiver has an SUD are associated with higher rates of physical and sexual abuse and trauma, poor parenting skills, and poor quality parent-child interactions, all of which are risk factors for SUDs. (See <a href=\"#H3654243859\" class=\"local\">'Family history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals who have SUD often have disrupted familial and social relationships, unfulfilled responsibilities at school or work, problems related to finances, the legal system, raising children, violence, and engaging in high risk behaviors. They often to engage in activities that were once enjoyable. (See <a href=\"#H1436783100\" class=\"local\">'Social history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To diagnose SUDs in routine clinical practice, a clinical interview is generally used to identify which DSM-5 diagnostic criteria are and are not met. Structured diagnostic instruments, developed to facilitate reliable and valid diagnoses for research, along with semistructured tools can be relatively lengthy and require training to administer; nonetheless, they can be useful in clinical practice in some specialized settings. (See <a href=\"#H4135196361\" class=\"local\">'DSM-5 diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3880104019\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Michael F Weaver, MD, and Margaret A E Jarvis, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Methodological summary and definitions. 2016. http://www.samhsa.gov/data/ (Accessed on March 06, 2017).</li><li class=\"breakAll\">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2011: National Estimates of Drug-Related Emergency Department Visits, HHS Publication No. (SMA) 13-4760, DAWN Series D-39, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Rockville 2013.</li><li class=\"breakAll\">Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality.
