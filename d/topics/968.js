A systematic review that included five randomized clinical trials comparing frenotomy with usual care, intensive lactation consultation, or sham surgery found that frenotomy is associated with improvements in breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, the available clinical trials were small and short-term with inconsistent methodology, and hence the quality of the evidence is low. Four of the clinical trials reported improvements in breastfeeding using either maternally reported or observer ratings, whereas two trials found no improvement with observer ratings. Breastfeeding-associated pain scores were assessed in three trials; one reported immediate improvement in nipple pain scores among mothers of frenotomized infants, whereas the other two trials found no difference in nipple pain between the frenotomy and sham groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Articulation issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Formal speech evaluation should be obtained in children who have ankyloglossia and difficulty pronouncing sibilants and lingual sounds (eg, &quot;t,&quot; &quot;d,&quot; &quot;z,&quot; &quot;s,&quot; &quot;th,&quot; &quot;n,&quot; &quot;l&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Speech therapy may improve articulation problems in some children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the English language, even the sounds that require the most amount of tongue movement, such as &quot;l&quot; and &quot;th,&quot; can be produced with minimal distortion, with the tongue tip pressed down instead of up towards the alveolar ridge (&quot;l&quot;), or protruding out (&quot;th&quot;). Similarly, other sounds that require tongue elevation, such as &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot; can also be produced effectively with the tongue tip down [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Consequently, ankyloglossia should not have a dramatic impact on speech function in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

Often, children are referred to the otolaryngologist after a full speech assessment and a trial of therapy with a request for surgical division of the frenulum. Most otolaryngologists request input from a speech pathologist before surgery to assess the need for surgery and to document the functional nature of the procedure for third-party payers.

Dividing a tongue-tie in infancy has some appeal, since it almost always can be accomplished without general anesthesia.

Pressure with a gauze sponge for a few minutes controls any capillary ooze. Some surgeons prefer division of the frenulum with a carbon dioxide or diode laser which permits bloodless incision; however, this adds additional cost to the procedure and offers no advantage in surgical results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The infant may feed immediately after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Potential adverse effects of frenotomy include bleeding, infection, ulceration, pain, damage to the tongue and submandibular ducts, and recurrence. Most studies report little discomfort and few adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8,29,42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,29,42-45</a>].</p><p>Postoperative &quot;tongue exercises&quot; (eg, massaging or stretching of the tongue and floor of mouth) are used at some centers; however, the advantage of such manipulations has not been demonstrated in any clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Frenuloplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frenuloplasty is release of ankyloglossia with plastic repair. It is reserved for ankyloglossia that is not relieved by simple division of the frenulum, posterior tongue-ties, and revision cases.</p><p>Frenuloplasty requires general anesthesia, sometimes by mask, but more commonly with oro- or nasotracheal intubation. In this procedure, the tongue is elevated with forceps, and the frenulum is divided in the sagittal plane as in frenotomy. Submucosal dissection continues into the genioglossus muscle in the midline until a full release is achieved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F53120\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53120 \">picture 6</a>). Bipolar electrosurgical scissors or monopolar cautery is preferred for dissection and hemostasis since the tongue musculature is vascular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Good illumination and magnification with loupes or an operating microscope permit division of the frenulum without injury to the nearby submandibular ducts. Midline dissection decreases the risks of injury to the lingual nerves.</p><p>Frenuloplasty dissection produces an elliptical tissue defect on the floor of the mouth. If left open, scarring and recurrent tethering of the tongue may result. The wound is usually closed with multiple simple absorbable sutures in the coronal plane to achieve a double V-Y advancement. Single or multiple Z-plasties have been advocated to prevent scar contracture. There are no comparative trials demonstrating an advantage to these more complicated repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=z-plasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Z-plasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following surgery, a normal diet can be resumed as tolerated. In older children undergoing frenuloplasty for articulation problems, continued speech therapy and specific tongue exercises are commonly used postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2061899607\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
