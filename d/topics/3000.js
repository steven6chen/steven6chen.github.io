If a person continually adjusts insulin doses, food intake, and exercise, it is often impossible to identify patterns that can be corrected. In this woman, keeping a three-day food record can determine if there are major problems with dietary inconsistency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60634 \">figure 1</a>). As can be seen, the woman's total carbohydrate intake and its distribution are markedly different each day. This variability prevents the attainment of strict glycemic control with an intensive insulin regimen.</p><p>You can attempt to correct the dietary inconsistency by advising her to consult a nutritionist or to attend a diet workshop, which can be set up for 6 to 10 patients at a time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cases-illustrating-problems-with-insulin-therapy-for-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At these workshops, approximately 10 to 12 meals are laid out, including breakfasts, fast food lunches, fancy evening meals, and snacks. Patients are asked to estimate how many grams of carbohydrate are in each meal. Their (and clinicians') estimates are often remarkably <strong>inaccurate</strong>, but can improve with training. Once this has been achieved, it is then possible to develop a Consistent Carbohydrate Profile for each patient. The patient can quote this profile to you at every clinic visit and, more importantly, it becomes part of their conscious behavior at meal times. Rather than forcing a patient to eat the same amount of carbohydrate at the same meal every day with a fixed dose of insulin, some patients can be taught to calculate a carbohydrate:insulin ratio. As an example, this patient may need 1 unit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> to cover 15 g of carbohydrate. Although she typically eats 90 g of carbohydrate for breakfast (and so takes 6 units of regular insulin), if she ate only 30 g on one morning, she would reduce her regular insulin dose to 2 units. She might then use an insulin algorithm to adjust this basic dose based on her blood glucose concentration (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">BEDTIME HYPERGLYCEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 27-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes is treated with the following regimen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before breakfast &ndash; 8 units <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-aspart-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin aspart</a> and 20 units <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-detemir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin detemir</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before evening meal &ndash; 4 units aspart</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before bedtime &ndash; 12 units detemir</p><p/><p>Her blood glucose values (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and, in parentheses, <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> are as follows:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Day &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Before &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Before &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Before &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Before<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;breakfast &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; lunch &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; evening meal &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; bedtime</p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;86 (4.8) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 104 (5.8) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;96 (5.3) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;320 (17.8)<br/>2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;146 (8.1) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 123 (6.8) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;105 (5.8) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 296 (16.4)<br/>3 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;111 (6.2) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;97 (5.4) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 92 (5.1) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;341 (18.9)</p></div></div><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation and approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main problem with her current level of glycemic control is hyperglycemia before bedtime.

It is also prudent to consider some other aspects of her lifestyle. As an example, she may be eating her evening meal very late, so that there is not much time between the meal and her bedtime test. Furthermore, the evening meal may be her biggest meal of the day. It would therefore be helpful to review her food record to see how she distributes her food and what type of food she is eating.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MORNING HYPERGLYCEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 24-year-old insurance salesman with type 1 diabetes for two years feels stressed and tired at work and has early morning headaches.

In addition, his insulin regimen is not ideal: he is taking too little <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a>, and he is taking NPH insulin too early in the evening. As an example, his high blood glucose values at 1:30 PM suggest that he needs to take regular insulin before lunch.</p><p>The triad of reasonable blood glucose values before bedtime, very high fasting values before breakfast, and a history of tiredness and early morning headache suggest a problem with the NPH insulin dose that he is taking before his evening meal. The action of the NPH insulin may be maximal in the late evening and middle of the night (causing both normoglycemia at bedtime and <strong>nocturnal hypoglycemia</strong>) and then dissipating in the early morning (causing <strong>hyperglycemia</strong> before breakfast) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cases-illustrating-problems-with-insulin-therapy-for-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The hypothesis that nocturnal hypoglycemia leads to fatigue and decreased well-being was tested in a study of 10 patients with type 1 diabetes who were evaluated on the morning after experimentally-induced nocturnal hypoglycemia (for one hour at 41 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.3 mM]) and on a control night when hypoglycemia was avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cases-illustrating-problems-with-insulin-therapy-for-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Symptoms of well-being and fatigue were significantly worse after the night of hypoglycemia, although higher cerebral function was unchanged.</p><p>The presence of nocturnal hypoglycemia followed by early morning hyperglycemia can be confirmed by measuring blood glucose at 3 AM. One solution is to move his evening dose of NPH insulin from before the evening meal to before bedtime. Another approach might be to switch from NPH insulin to an insulin with a longer, flatter profile (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> or detemir). In addition, other aspects of his lifestyle should also be evaluated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>He may not be eating enough carbohydrate in his evening meal or late night snack.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, the type of food he is eating may be inadequate to maintain his blood glucose concentration through the night. A bedtime snack that is low in protein, fat, and fiber may be entirely digested and absorbed within two or three hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of his exercise patterns in the evening may also be helpful. Vigorous exercise at that time makes it more likely that his blood glucose concentration will fall to low values during the night.</p><p/><p>The following changes in his insulin regimen lead to marked improvement in his glycemic control:</p><p>8 units <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glulisine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glulisine</a> and 30 units <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> before breakfast</p><p>6 units glulisine before lunch</p><p>8 units glulisine before the evening meal</p><p>Three months later his blood glucose values (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and, in parentheses, <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> are:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Day &#160; &#160;Before &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Before &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Before &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Before &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 AM<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; breakfast &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; lunch &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; snack &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; evening meal &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;bedtime</p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 141 (7.7) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;110 (6.2) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 161 (8.9) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;82 (4.6) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 140 (7.8) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;92 (5.1)<br/>2 &#160; &#160; &#160; 121 (6.7) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;163 (9.1) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 134 (7.4) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;96 (5.3) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 93 (5.2)<br/>3 &#160; &#160; &#160; 150 (8.3) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;153 (8.5) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 110 (6.2) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 107 (5.9) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;144 (8.0) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;104 (5.9)</p></div></div><p>His A1C value is now 7.8 percent.

In this situation, it is important to take a more detailed history of exactly what his day-to-day life is like and exactly how and where he is giving his insulin injections. Some days he is up at 7 AM, and on other days he does not get up until 1 PM. The timing of his &quot;morning&quot; dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> therefore varies by six hours from day to day. He has been rotating his glargine and lispro shots from his arm, leg, buttock, or abdomen just like he was told to do when he was first diagnosed at age nine. One day he went for a three-hour bike ride just after giving his morning glargine insulin in his thigh. He was severely hypoglycemic two hours into the ride. He sometimes forgets to check his blood glucose or take his lispro before he eats so then takes a dose of lispro immediately after the meal based on how much carbohydrate he thinks he just ate. He then checks his blood glucose one to two hours later and gives himself a &quot;correction dose&quot; of lispro at that time if his blood glucose is too high.</p><p>Chaotic blood glucose patterns usually indicate a chaotic lifestyle. You can attempt to help the patient reduce sources of variability. Is there a consistent time of day for him to give his glargine insulin in the afternoon or evening so that it is given at more or less the same time every day? Ask him not to exercise a leg or arm within two hours of giving an insulin injection into that limb. Try giving the glargine insulin in the buttock or thigh and lispro into the abdomen. Help him come up with strategies to remind him to check his blood glucose levels before his meals and to take the dose of lispro insulin based on the blood glucose and the estimated amount of carbohydrate he is about to eat.</p><p>Some patients like this will do better when using a continuous glucose monitor to show them in close to real time what their blood glucose levels are doing. He might also do better using an insulin pump, but neither of these technologies will magically make things better for him unless he can address some of the causes of extreme day-to-day variability in his lifestyle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284559309\"><span class=\"h2\">Some consistency in glucose pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 32-year-old executive has a busy office job that is unpredictable in terms of physical activity, time of meals, or the length of the workday.

The individual values are also fairly consistent (from 147 to 191 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [8.2 to 10.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> apart from one high value (246 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [13.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> on day 5, which can probably be explained by her late-night pizza the preceding day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cases-illustrating-problems-with-insulin-therapy-for-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].<br/><br/>This patient should benefit from increasing her NPH insulin dose before the evening meal, since this is the insulin that is working during the night. However, her two 3 AM values are in the ideal range. There is therefore a risk that increasing her evening NPH insulin dose will induce nocturnal hypoglycemia. This risk can be minimized by increasing her evening NPH insulin in small increments and continuing to measure blood glucose both at 3 AM and before breakfast. Another approach is to have her take her evening dose of NPH insulin at bedtime, instead of before the evening meal. She could also be switched to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-detemir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin detemir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before lunch &ndash; Her before-lunch blood glucose values are consistent and average 106 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. This is very good control, suggesting that her morning dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> and her breakfast and mid-morning snacks are appropriate and consistent from day to day and that her exercise and work schedule for the morning are relatively constant. However, she may be in danger of hypoglycemia before lunch once her before breakfast glucose values are lowered as recommended above. It might therefore be wise to slightly decrease her morning regular insulin dose as the evening NPH insulin dose is increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before evening meal &ndash; Her before evening meal blood glucose values are too low, with an average value of 78 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and two hypoglycemic episodes during the week. These findings suggest that she may be taking too much NPH insulin before breakfast, since this is the insulin that is acting during the afternoon. Another possible explanation might be that her lunch is too early or too light, or that she doesn't eat an adequate mid-afternoon snack. There is inadequate information to identify the primary problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before bedtime &ndash; Her before bedtime blood glucose values average 138 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. While this average is close to ideal, the individual values vary widely from 57 to 301 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.2 to 16.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. This suggests that some variable aspect of her lifestyle is creating the fluctuations in the bedtime glucose values. Possible problems include variation in the time or content of her evening meal or in evening exercise. As an example, the blood glucose value of 301 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (16.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> before bedtime on day 2 may have resulted from dietary overcompensation for her hypoglycemic episode before the evening meal.</p><p/><p>In summary, this patient's record keeping is better than most. Nevertheless, it is not sufficient to permit assessment of her problems before the evening meal and before bedtime. It would be helpful to know the exact times when her blood glucose was measured and exactly when she eats and the content of each meal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">LATE AFTERNOON HYPOGLYCEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 42-year-old garage mechanic is treated with the following insulin regimen: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before breakfast &ndash; 8 units <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-lispro-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin lispro</a> and 16 units <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before lunch &ndash; 4 units lispro</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before evening meal &ndash; 10 units lispro and 22 units glargine</p><p/><p>He uses an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F83953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83953 \">table 2</a>) to adjust pre-meal doses of lispro insulin.</p><p>Blood glucose values (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or, in parentheses, <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> for one week are shown below.
