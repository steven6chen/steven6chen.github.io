Inherited bleeding disorders include abnormalities of coagulation factors and platelet function; the most common of these disorders is von Willebrand disease. However, when the term &quot;hemophilia&quot; is used, it most often refers to the following two disorders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B, also called Christmas disease)</p><p/><p>Patients with hemophilia, particularly those with severe disease, develop bleeding episodes that are treated with replacement of the missing factor (ie, factor VIII or factor IX concentrates). A complication of hemophilia treatment is the development of an inhibitor, which usually occurs shortly after replacement therapy has been initiated. The inhibitors are antibodies (primarily IgG) directed against the specific deficient factor.</p><p>Development of inhibitors is typically assessed in relationship to the number of exposure days (ie, days on which the patient has received one or more doses of replacement factor).</p><p>This topic reviews the pathophysiology risk factors for inhibitor development in hemophilia A and B, as well as our approach to inhibitor eradication by immune tolerance induction.</p><p>The treatment of bleeding in patients with inhibitors is discussed in detail separately, as are general recommendations about hemophilia management, factor prophylaxis, diagnosis, and genetics.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management, including patients with inhibitors</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b#H3225624639\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B&quot;, section on 'Inhibitors'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Routine management including factor prophylaxis</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemophilia A and B: Routine management including prophylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management of age-related comorbidities</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-and-age-related-comorbidities-in-people-with-hemophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications and age-related comorbidities in people with hemophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetics</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hemophilia-a-and-b\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hemophilia A and B&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Acquired inhibitors of factor VIII, factor IX, and other coagulation factors are also discussed separately.

Many of the principles that apply to factor VIII inhibitors also apply to factor IX inhibitors. However, the development of inhibitors in factor IX deficiency may be associated with some specific manifestations including anaphylaxis and nephrotic syndrome (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Inhibitors in hemophilia B'</a> below).</p><p>Inhibitors in both hemophilia A and B are more likely to form in patients with severe disease.

Such patients show an increase in antibody titer after each exposure; this response begins within 2 to 3 days, peaks at 7 to 21 days, and may persist for years in the absence of re-exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

They primarily occur early in treatment (eg, within the first 50 exposure days) in young children, and are much less common in patients with moderate and mild hemophilia A (3 to 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,10</a>].</p><p>These relationships were illustrated in a study in which 95 children who were not previously exposed to factor VIII were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viii-recombinant-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human factor VIII</a>; the median follow-up was 1.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Findings included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor VIII inhibitors developed in 20 percent of patients after a median of nine days of exposure (which represented 15 months from initial treatment).

These inhibitors are termed &quot;transient&quot;, and are more likely to occur in patients with a low inhibitor titer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall risk in patients with severe disease was estimated at 36 percent after 18 days of exposure, a value similar to 38 percent after 25 days of exposure in another recombinant factor VIII trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>Lower rates of inhibitor development have been reported in studies that included previously treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In a metaanalysis of 4323 previously treated patients, the rate of inhibitor development was 3 per 1000 person-years, with no clear association between inhibitor development and other putative risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These data suggest that the likelihood of inhibitor development declines with increasing exposure days but is never completely eliminated. Aging is associated with changes in the immune system that may affect the incidence of inhibitor development in some older patients. (See <a href=\"#H3518476844\" class=\"local\">'Age'</a> below and <a href=\"#H847653\" class=\"local\">'Immunologic factors'</a> below.)</p><p>The age-adjusted incidence of new factor VIII inhibitors was analyzed in all UK patients with severe hemophilia A between 1990 and 2009. A total of 315 new inhibitors were reported in 2528 patients (12 percent) followed for a median of 12 years. The incidences of new inhibitors were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zero to 5 years: <span class=\"nowrap\">64/1000</span> patient-years at risk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5 to 9 years: 9.<span class=\"nowrap\">4/1000</span> patient-years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10 to 59 years: 5.<span class=\"nowrap\">3/1000</span> patient-years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>60 or more years: 10.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/1000</span> patient-years</p><p/><p>These results are of interest for two reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They indicate a bimodal risk of factor VIII inhibitor development, in early childhood and in old age. The reason for the latter is poorly understood, apparently resulting from a breakdown of immune tolerance with increasing age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older patients with factor VIII deficiency may need closer monitoring for the development of inhibitors, which may become important if they need surgery or treatment with <span class=\"nowrap\">antithrombotics/anticoagulants</span> for age-related disease.

Factor VIII consists of a heavy chain with A1 and A2 domains, a connecting region with a B1 domain that is not required for clotting, and a light chain with A3, C1, and C2 domains. Most antibodies are directed against A2 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C2 domains, although other epitopes may also be involved, whether treated with plasma or recombinant factor VIII [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>].</p><p>Not all antibodies to factor VIII are pathologic, and not all pathologic antibodies are similar in their spectrum. Patients with congenital hemophilia who form inhibitors often produce multiple antibodies that bind distinct epitopes of the infused factor VIII, some of which block its function and dramatically reduce its efficacy in treating bleeding. In contrast, patients with acquired hemophilia are more likely to have a single antibody, often directed against a single domain of factor VIII [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Individuals in the general population (ie, without hemophilia) may also produce antibodies to factor VIII that do not affect factor VIII function.</p><p>Increased understanding of the function of these epitopes helps explain why antibodies in patients with hemophilia A interfere with factor VIII function. The role of the different domains is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-factor-viii-and-factor-ix\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of factor VIII and factor IX&quot;</a>.) Summarized briefly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The C2 domain binds to the procoagulant phospholipid phosphatidylserine on activated platelets and endothelial cells and to von Willebrand factor. An overlap exists in the epitope for both binding functions.

Patients were followed for up to 50 exposure days or three years after randomization, whichever came first. The primary outcome was development of any inhibitor with a titer of at least 0.4 Bethesda units (centrally performed Nijmegen method); secondary outcomes included development of high-titer inhibitors (peak titer &ge;5 Bethesda units). Inhibitors developed in 47 of 126 individuals who received recombinant factor VIII (37 percent) and 29 of 125 individuals who received plasma-derived factor VIII (23 percent; hazard ratio [HR] for recombinant products 1.87). The results remained essentially the same when the results were analyzed after removing data on second generation products, which had been previously suggested to have an increased risk of inhibitor development. High titer inhibitors were also more frequent in recombinant factor VIII arm (24 versus 16 percent). There were two deaths, both in the plasma-derived factor VIII arm (one from bleeding and one motor vehicle accident), and nine episodes of severe bleeding (six in the recombinant factor VIII arm and five in the plasma-derived factor VIII arm).</p><p>The mechanism of increased risk of inhibitors with certain recombinant products is unknown. The plasma derived products studied in the SIPPET trial contained von Willebrand factor (VWF) and other plasma proteins. Plasma derived products also are likely to differ in post-translational modifications from recombinant products used in the SIPPET study, which were manufactured from non-human cell lines.

The RODIN study found a higher risk of inhibitor formation with second generation full-length recombinant products compared with third generation recombinant products (adjusted HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.08-2.37); however, the implications of this finding were less clear due to lack of randomization and small numbers of patients. In a 2012 observational study of 111 patients with hemophilia A who developed inhibitors found that compared with those who received <span class=\"nowrap\">low/intermediate</span> purity factor VIII products, those who received high purity plasma derived products had an increased risk of inhibitor development (adjusted HR 2.0; 95% CI 1.1-4.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Some observational studies published before the SIPPET trial found no difference between recombinant and plasma-derived products; however, these results may have been subject to confounding factors that were eliminated in the randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>All inhibitors in the SIPPET trial occurred before 39 exposure days, and all high-titer inhibitors occurred before 34 exposure days. Thus, for individuals with hemophilia A who are receiving a recombinant factor VIII product and have not developed an inhibitor and are past the high-risk exposure period, switching to a VWF-containing plasma derived product does not appear necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868410569\"><span class=\"h4\">Switching products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple studies that address the role of switching products in inhibitor development; none of these support an increased risk of inhibitor development due to switching products in previously treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. As, an example, in an observational study in which all Irish patients with hemophilia A (113 individuals) were switched from one recombinant factor VIII product to another, only one developed a new inhibitor; this was a one-year-old boy who had only received three doses of the previous product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>If antibodies form in multiply exposed patients who have been changed to a new product, product-related factors might be responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/46,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,50,51</a>]. In this case consideration should be given to the use of the prior product if the patient has had many exposure days in the past, although change to the prior product may not always result in inhibitor disappearance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1507328595\"><span class=\"h4\">Dose intensity or schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose intensity or schedule of the product is another potential risk factor for inhibitor development.

Inhibitors developed in 5.3, 6.7, and 13.3 percent of individuals after 38, 50, and 100 exposure days, respectively. However, product dose <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> number of exposure days could also be a surrogate for immunologic factors such as the degree of tissue injury.

However, after adjustment for treatment intensity, this association largely disappeared. Patients who were first treated for surgical procedures rather than for bleeding or prophylaxis (relative risk 3.7; 95% CI 2.0-7.1) and patients who received factor VIII on at least five consecutive days at the start of treatment (RR 3.3; 95% CI 2.1-5.3) were at increased inhibitor risk, as were those who had a positive family history of inhibitor development.

Rather, in two subgroup analyses of 25 children who remained inhibitor-free up to the age of 35 months, those who started prophylaxis had a significantly lower risk of developing inhibitors than those treated on demand (adjusted OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case-control study involving 36 subjects with mild or moderate hemophilia A and an inhibitor, and 62 controls with mild to moderate hemophilia A without an inhibitor, treatment with factor VIII for six or more consecutive days during the prior year was significantly associated with inhibitor development in those &ge;30 years of age (OR 12.6; 95% CI 2.8-58) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H847653\" class=\"local\">'Immunologic factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Ascertainment bias may also explain these results: patients with totally absent factor VIII levels (eg, those with large deletions) may have more severe disease than those with other &quot;severe&quot; mutations, and therefore be more disposed to early bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment. Modifying genes that influence overall hemostasis may affect predilection for early versus late bleeding, thereby confounding the interpretation of age versus risk for inhibitor development. Additionally, variability in bleeding among individuals with &lt;1 percent activity could be related to difficulty in accurate measurement of levels in the very low range as well as to other modifying individual host factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1359628122\"><span class=\"h3\">Race</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Race is also a factor in inhibitor development. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Malmo International Brother Study of patients with hemophilia A and B, the incidences of inhibitors in whites, blacks, and a heterogenous group consisting of Hispanic, Asian, and Asian Indian individuals were 27, 56, and 50 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cross sectional analysis of 5651 males with severe hemophilia A, the prevalences of high-titer inhibitors in whites, blacks, and Hispanics were 16, 25, and 27 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p>A partial explanation for this difference may be the use of purified or recombinant factor VIII products that differ from the patient's own factor VIII protein at one or two residues representing common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the factor VIII gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. SNPs are genetic differences that vary by population and do not affect normal factor VIII function.

A large clinical investigation is ongoing by these investigators to verify whether these interpretations are borne out in a larger cohort of African Americans and Africans; in this ongoing study, the immune response to factor VIII is being individually assessed using advanced immunologic measurements.</p><p>For patients with severe hemophilia who have a null mutation, the presence or lack of a specific haplotype in the infused factor VIII should not matter, since the patient should not have had circulating factor VIII in utero to induce tolerance to factor VIII. The possibility that the &quot;null&quot; mutation encodes for a truncated molecule capable of inducing partial prenatal immune tolerance may explain the discordancy between whites and non-whites in this cohort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H847653\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunologic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Development of inhibitors is an immune phenomenon, and some data have suggested that immunologic factors may contribute to inhibitor development. As an example, the Hemophilia Inhibitor Genetics Study (HIGS) evaluated genes involved in immune regulation among 104 sibling pairs with hemophilia A who were discordant in inhibitor status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. As siblings, these individuals had the same factor VIII mutation. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) demonstrated variations in 13 immune <span class=\"nowrap\">response/immune</span> modifier genes that correlated with inhibitor development. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;, section on 'Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)'</a>.)</p><p>Another immunologic factor that could play a role in the development of inhibitors is the degree of tissue injury or damage present at the time of factor infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. More severe injury is likely to accompany major bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery. Investigators used the dose of factor VIII as a surrogate for more severe injury, and analyzed the rate of inhibitor development relative to the factor VIII dose intensity in a subset of previously unexposed children given factor VIII in the RODIN study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. High intensity factor treatment was associated with an increased risk of inhibitor development (adjusted HR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-3.0), while prophylactic therapy was associated with a lower risk (adjusted HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.35-1.1). While these findings suggest a potential biologic mechanism, they have not resulted in a change in our management of patients with severe bleeding.</p><p>Additional immunologic factors that may play a role in inhibitor development include HLA class II antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Polymorphisms of immune response genes, such as the interleukin-10 gene and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) gene, which have been associated with autoantibody production in other disorders, may also be associated with inhibitor development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>]. Similarly, polymorphisms within the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA) gene locus appear to be potential modulators of the immune response to replacement therapy in patients with hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/64,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,68</a>].</p><p>Age-associated changes in immune function may also affect inhibitor development.

Similar incidences were noted in a validation cohort of 64 patients. One point to note is that this score requires that the patient be treated, a disadvantage when trying to predict the risk of inhibitor development in any particular patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations (factor VIII inhibitors)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of factor VIII antibodies in patients with hemophilia A depend in part upon the severity of the disease. In general, the inhibitor does not lead to a marked increase in the frequency of bleeding events. However, a patient receiving prophylactic factor infusions who develops an inhibitor may experience new breakthrough bleeding or may not have spontaneous resolution of bleeding as expected based on prior experience. Patients with inhibitors may have more difficulty in achieving hemostasis and tend to have more musculoskeletal complications; in this setting, the bleeding frequency may increase due to the presence of acute and chronic synovitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Inhibitors make the treatment of bleeding episodes more difficult. Thus, an inhibitor should be suspected when any bleeding episode is refractory to usual therapy, particularly in patients with severe hemophilia.</p><p>On the other hand, bleeding episodes may be induced in patients with mild to moderate disease if the inhibitor causes a fall in factor VIII levels, converting the patient to a more severe phenotype. One series identified factor VIII inhibitors in 26 patients with mild or moderate hemophilia A; most of the inhibitors developed after a period of intensive replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Spontaneous bleeding occurred in 22, with a bleeding pattern similar to that of acquired hemophilia in 17. The inhibitor persisted in 10 patients for a median of eight years. It disappeared after a median of nine months in the remaining patients, either spontaneously or after immune tolerance induction. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Immune tolerance induction (factor VIII inhibitors)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and screening (factor VIII inhibitors)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factor VIII inhibitor activity generally is measured by the Bethesda assay, which both establishes the diagnosis of a factor VIII inhibitor and quantifies the antibody titer. In this Bethesda assay, serial dilutions of patient plasma are incubated with pooled normal plasma at 37&ordm;C for two hours; residual factor VIII activity then is measured using a clotting assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The reciprocal of the dilution of patient plasma that results in residual 50 percent factor VIII activity is the titer of the inhibitor in Bethesda units (BU). The higher the inhibitor titer, the greater the dilution required to demonstrate residual factor VIII activity. In some cases, pharmacokinetic studies may be performed to determine the response to infusion and the half-life of the infused product.</p><p>We use the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay if available, because it appears to have improved specificity and reliability, especially with lower titer inhibitors, by enhancing the intrinsic buffering effect following serial dilution in the assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Initial, limited information has been presented on an immunoassay for anti-factor VIII antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>There is no standardized algorithm for the timing of inhibitor screening and experts vary in their screening protocol. A reasonable approach includes testing for the development of an inhibitor at least annually, and more frequently in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately once every 10 exposure days (ie, days in which the patient has received one or more infusions of factor VIII) for the first 50 exposure days in severely deficient patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least annually in a patient beyond the first 50 exposure days or a patient who has fewer than 10 exposure days per year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a patient has a poor clinical response to usual replacement therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a patient develops increased severity or frequency of bleeding.</p><p/><p>An elevated inhibitor titer should be confirmed promptly with a second sample, especially if the first sample was drawn through a heparinized line.</p><p>In some cases, testing to determine the presence of a lupus anticoagulant (LA) is indicated, as these can confound the diagnosis of low-titer inhibitors. No single test is optimal to eliminate the possibility of a LA in these circumstances, and the full spectrum of assays performed at the local institution should be performed. If testing reveals a LA, pharmacokinetic studies and serial testing over time may help elucidate whether a specific factor VIII inhibitor is also present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome#H60490098\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;, section on 'Antiphospholipid antibody testing'</a>.)</p><p>This approach is consistent with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) expert meeting report, which emphasized that inhibitor screening is important for timely and effective management of patients with hemophilia and reported that inhibitors are likely to be under-reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>In the United States, development of a new inhibitor should be reported to the US Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/index.cfm?action=reporting.home&amp;token=HKkZOQQqv3WSNQrw2/pEDgTI0Y4kEwWpBQJYCFcfj2ugrYra/utFlFQ4GOqXnLCSqI/cryhUXtth4VGlQVfj8kWxOwvJuG2DNmEIoDy1AFg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1308\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MedWatch adverse event reporting system.</a></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment (factor VIII inhibitors)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comprehensive Hemophilia Treatment Centers provide expertise for these specialized patients and should be consulted for the development of any treatment plan in a hemophilic patient with an inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The two components to therapy are treatment of active bleeding and inhibitor ablation via immune tolerance induction. Advances in these areas have led to an improvement in outcome among patients with hemophilia A and inhibitors.

Although less successful overall, ITI should still be considered and used in appropriate patients in these groups. Initiating ITI at a low initial titer, preferably &lt;10 BU, must be balanced against the risk of waiting too long and allowing inhibitors to become memory responses. If the decision to wait to start ITI until a titer of &lt;10 BU is achieved, then the titer should be followed regularly to identify a continued fall or plateau.</p><p>Many ITI responders have an initial rise in antibody titers caused by the anamnestic response, followed by a progressive reduction to a low or undetectable titer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/3,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,81</a>].

The associated reduction in the Bethesda assay to undetectable levels appeared to involve the production of antiidiotypic antibodies that neutralized the inhibitory capacity of the factor VIII antibodies. In another report, tolerant patients had circulating antibodies against factor VIII that, compared with the original inhibitor, differed in specificity, lacked coagulation inhibitory activity, and did not enhance the rate of elimination of factor VIII [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4518078\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications and timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally pursue ITI in individuals with severe hemophilia A and a factor VIII inhibitor with a titer &gt;5 Bethesda units that is present on repeated measurements at least two weeks apart.

If venous access is not an issue, we favor high-dose ITI regimens (eg, at least 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/kg</span> daily) to elicit a response as rapidly as possible. We generally use the product the patient has been receiving when the inhibitor developed, but we may change to a concentrate with intact von Willebrand factor (VWF) if the titer does not decline. The presence of VWF as a carrier protein for factor VIII has been hypothesized to mitigate the effects of neutralizing antibodies, and results from the SIPPET trial demonstrated that plasma-derived factor VIII products were associated with a lower frequency of inhibitor development. (See <a href=\"#H15593804\" class=\"local\">'Replacement product'</a> above.)</p><p>We generally reserve immunosuppressive agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> for patients with titers that do not decline with a VWF-containing concentrate.

Patients assigned to the low-dose arm received 50 international units (IU) of factor VIII per <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/day</span> for three days per week, and those assigned to the high-dose arm received 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/kg/day</span> for seven days a week. The study was closed early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board because patients in the low-dose arm experienced significantly higher frequency of bleeding events than those in the high-dose arm (86 versus 63 percent). Despite this difference in clinical bleeding, the rate of successful ITI was similar (41 percent in the low-dose arm versus 39 percent in the high-dose arm). The median time for inhibitor decline was also similar between the two arms (5.5 months). There were no differences in other adverse events (eg, central line infections, allergic reactions).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter survey of 158 patients from an international registry, 68 percent had complete tolerance, 7 percent partial tolerance, and 25 percent did not respond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Success was most likely with higher doses (&ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per day) and low levels of inhibitor (&lt;10 Bethesda units) at the start of therapy, even though most patients were high responders. Once achieved, tolerance was long-lasting, as only 1 of 107 responders relapsed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on 188 courses of ITI were obtained via questionnaire by the North American Immune Tolerance Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Outcome parameters noted to be predictive of ITI success for hemophilia A included historical peak inhibitor titers pre-ITT and during ITT. As an example, ITT was successful in 83 versus 40 percent of patients with hemophilia A when the pre-ITT titer was &lt;10 or &ge;10 BU, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 86 patients recruited as part of the Italian ITI registry (the PROFIT study), factor VIII mutations known to be associated with a high risk of factor VIII inhibitor formation (large deletions, inversions, nonsense and splice site mutations) were found in 81 percent, while lower risk mutations (small <span class=\"nowrap\">insertions/deletions,</span> nonsense mutations) were found in 19 percent. Although ITI was not performed in a uniform manner or at a uniform time after inhibitor development, the low-risk mutation group showed a higher ITI success rate than those with high-risk mutations (81 versus 41 percent success) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].

We generally reserve rituximab for individuals with inhibitors that do not respond to ITI using a VWF-containing regimen. The rationale for this includes the limited available data regarding this agent in ITI and the potential risks of rituximab such as infusion reactions, infections, and hepatitis B reactivation. These are discussed in more detail separately.

Some evidence indicates that, as in hemophilia A, inhibitors primarily form in patients with gene deletions, major derangements, or nonsense mutations and who have little or no endogenous factor IX, suggesting that the absence of self factor IX prevents the induction of tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>]. The lower incidence of inhibitors in hemophilia B may be related to a lower frequency of patients with such severe gene defects because the risk of inhibitors in patients with missense mutations is extremely low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>].</p><p>As an example, only 2 percent of patients in the International hemophilia B database have developed inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia/abstract/103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104</a>]. Among these, 23 percent of those with gross deletions and 30 percent of the complete deletion entries have developed inhibitors.

The diagnosis should be confirmed in the laboratory with a Bethesda assay for factor IX. The majority of patients with factor IX deficiency and inhibitors are high responders (ie, titer of &gt;5 Bethesda units, increasing titer upon re-exposure to factor IX, and persistence of inhibitor years after exposure to factor IX).

For factor VIII inhibitors, the severity of factor deficiency is a major predisposing factor; the type of replacement product used also appears to be a factor in inhibitor development as discussed above. Development of an inhibitor does not lead to a marked increase in the frequency of bleeding events except when an individual with moderate or mild factor VIII deficiency is converted to a more severe state due to inhibitor development; however, bleeding episodes may be more difficult to control, and the overall number of bleeding episodes may increase over time due to development of musculoskeletal complications.
