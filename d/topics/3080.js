The most common causes of acute scrotal pain in children and adolescents include testicular torsion, torsion of the appendix testis, and epididymitis. In one review of 238 consecutive boys, ages 0 to 19 years, who presented with acute scrotal pain to a children's hospital over a two-year period, 16 percent had testicular torsion, 46 percent had torsion of the appendix testis, and 35 percent had epididymitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTICULAR TORSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testicular torsion is the most dramatic and potentially serious of the acute processes affecting the scrotal contents because it may result in the loss of the testicle. Normal testicular anatomy is depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75672\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75672 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Intravaginal torsion results from inadequate fixation of the testis to the tunica vaginalis through the gubernaculum testis. The most common abnormality associated with testicular torsion is known as the &quot;bell clapper&quot; deformity: The testicle lacks the normal attachment to the tunica vaginalis (permitting increased mobility) and rests transverse within the scrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55518 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The bell clapper deformity may be bilateral and predisposes to testicular torsion.</p><p>If fixation of the lower pole of the testis to the tunica vaginalis is insufficiently broad-based or absent, the testis may torse (twist) on the spermatic cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77468\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77468 \">figure 3</a>). The twisting of the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis causes venous compression and subsequent edema of the testicle and cord with ultimate ischemia of the testicle caused by arterial occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Neonatal testicular torsion, which is extravaginal, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-testicular-torsion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal testicular torsion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Testicular torsion has two peak incidences: a small one in the neonatal period and a large one during puberty, but it can occur at any age. The incidence is estimated to be 1 in 4000 in males younger than 25 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Approximately 65 percent of cases occur in boys between the ages of 12 and 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The increased incidence during adolescence is thought to be secondary to the increasing weight of the testes during pubertal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients classically present with an abrupt onset of severe testicular or scrotal pain, usually of less than 12 hours' duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,9</a>]; however, inguinal or lower abdominal pain may be the presenting complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Nearly 90 percent of patients may have associated nausea and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The pain can be isolated to the scrotum or may radiate to the lower abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. The pain is constant unless the testicle is torsing and detorsing. A typical presentation, particularly in children, is for the patient to awaken with scrotal pain in the middle of the night or in the morning. Many boys report a previous episode of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,5,7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,7,13</a>]. However, one study reported only 8 percent of the patients with torsion had a history of pain in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>On physical examination, the scrotum may be edematous, indurated and erythematous and the affected testis usually is tender, swollen, and slightly elevated because of shortening of the cord from twisting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F112360\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112360 \">picture 1</a>). The testis may be lying horizontally, displacing the epididymis from its normal posterolateral position. A reactive hydrocele may also be present.</p><p>The cremasteric reflex (elevation of the testis in response to stroking of the upper inner thigh) is absent in nearly all cases of torsion, but it also may be absent in boys without torsion, particularly if they are younger than six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,9,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,14-17</a>].</p><p>Prehn reported that elevation of the scrotal contents relieves the pain in patients with epididymitis and aggravates or has no effect on the pain in patients with testicular torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, Prehn sign is not a reliable distinguishing feature between torsion and other diagnoses in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Intermittent torsion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent testicular torsion, characterized by the sudden onset of acute and intermittent sharp testicular pain and scrotal swelling, with rapid resolution (within seconds to a few minutes) and long intervals without symptoms, should be considered in all boys with a history of such scrotal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swelling without other identifiable causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>In one review of 50 patients with intermittent testicular torsion, 26 percent reported nausea or vomiting, and 21 percent reported that the pain awakened them from sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Physical findings of intermittent testicular torsion may include horizontal or very mobile testes, anterior epididymis, or bulkiness of the spermatic cord from partial twisting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. These findings are usually present to varying degrees on physical examination. However, the clinical and radiographic evaluations of some boys with intermittent torsion may be normal, highlighting the importance of immediate follow-up for recurrent or worsening pain.</p><p>All boys suspected to have intermittent testicular torsion should have an ultrasound that includes imaging of the spermatic cord. Although the testes may have normal architecture and flow, in some cases views of the cord show a whirlpool sign or a pseudomass. Boys with intermittent complaints, normal physical examination, and an unremarkable ultrasound of the testis spermatic cord at the time of presentation should have a follow-up evaluation within seven days unless pain recurs sooner. Ultrasound for intermittent torsion is at best 75 percent sensitive, and the diagnosis of this condition remains clinical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of testicular torsion can be made clinically. Thus, when clinical findings indicate a high likelihood for testicular torsion (eg, acute onset of severe testicular pain in association with nausea or vomiting, absent cremasteric reflex, and testicular changes on physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F112360\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112360 \">picture 1</a>)), the clinician should promptly consult a surgeon with pediatric urologic expertise to evaluate the patient and make a decision regarding operative exploration and repair. </p><p>Observational studies suggest that clinical findings can reliably identify testicular torsion. For example, in a retrospective study of 79 boys with an acute scrotum (10 percent with testicular torsion), the absence of ipsilateral cremasteric reflex, skin changes, and the presence of nausea and or vomiting were most consistently predictive of torsion based upon adjusted analysis of 22 factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>In a<em> </em>prospective study of 338 children with an acute scrotum evaluated at a single institution, the following clinical scoring system for testicular torsion was derived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nausea or vomiting</strong> &ndash; 1 point</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Testicular swelling</strong> &ndash; 2 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hard testis on palpation</strong> &ndash; 2 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High riding testis</strong> &ndash; 1 point</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absent cremasteric reflex</strong> &ndash; 1 point</p><p/><p>A score &ge;5 diagnosed testicular torsion with a sensitivity of 76 percent, specificity of 100 percent, and a positive predictive value of 100 percent (prevalence 15 percent). A score &le;2 excluded testicular torsion with a sensitivity of 100 percent, a specificity of 82 percent, and a negative predictive value of 100 percent. A retrospective validation of this score in 116 children seen for acute scrotum at a different institution found similar results. </p><p>Taken together, these studies support the practice of early surgical consultation for children in whom testicular torsion is strongly suspected based upon history and physical examination rather than performing imaging. Although the scoring system described above had a high negative predictive value for testicular torsion, further validation is needed before it is routinely used to exclude testicular torsion without a confirmatory ultrasound. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1892094\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A color Doppler ultrasound of the scrotum is typically undertaken in patients with equivocal clinical findings when the performance of imaging will not significantly delay treatment. Demonstration of decreased testicular perfusion or twisting of the spermatic cord is consistent with testicular torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Decreased testicular perfusion also can be seen in some patients with a large hydrocele, abscess, hematoma, or scrotal hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Negative scans (ie, normal or increased testicular flow) may occur rarely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19</a>], usually with spontaneous detorsion and partial or intermittent torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The Doppler ultrasound can discern testicular and epididymal size, scrotal fluid, scrotal wall thickening, enlarged appendix testis, twisting of the spermatic cord, and arterial flow in the testis and epididymis. The reported sensitivity and specificity of Doppler ultrasound in the detection of testicular torsion range from 69 to 100 percent and 77 to 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25-30</a>]. The usefulness of Doppler ultrasound is limited in small prepubertal testes with lower blood flow.</p><p>The nuclear scan measures testicular perfusion. The reported sensitivity and specificity of scintigraphy are 100 percent and 97 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30</a>]. However, a nuclear scan takes several hours to perform and is typically not available quickly enough to permit timely operative detorsion and orchiopexy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of testicular torsion, whether made clinically or radiographically, requires immediate consultation with a urologist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64809\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64809 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The treatment for a torsed testicle that remains viable involves surgical detorsion and fixation (orchiopexy) of both testes. Orchiectomy is performed if the testicle is nonviable. The viability of a torsed testicle is dependent upon the duration and completeness of torsion. Typical rates of viability according to duration of torsion have been described as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detorsion within 4 to 6 hours &ndash; 100 percent viability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detorsion after 12 hours &ndash; 20 percent viability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detorsion after 24 hours &ndash; 0 percent viability</p><p/><p>Surgery never should be delayed on the assumption of nonviability based upon a clinical estimate of duration of torsion. Some patients with a prolonged period of symptoms may have had intermittent torsion or a partial torsion and testicles that are salvageable.</p><p>The contralateral hemiscrotum typically is explored during surgery because the bell clapper deformity usually is bilateral. Exploration permits fixation of the contralateral testis to prevent future torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,5,13,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,13,31</a>].</p><p>Some authors report decreased fertility after unilateral testicular torsion when the testis is left in situ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>], possibly because of immune-mediated damage to the contralateral testis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36,37</a>]. However, no evidence of decreased fertility or anti-sperm antibodies was found in one study of prepubertal boys with testicular torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and the fertility issue remains controversial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Manual detorsion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that children and adolescents with testicular torsion based upon clinical findings or documented on ultrasound undergo an attempt at manual detorsion prior to surgery if emergency operative care is not rapidly available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F112358\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112358 \">figure 4</a>). Manual detorsion of the torsed testicle can restore blood flow while the patient awaits surgical correction and increases the probability of testicular salvage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,39-41</a>]. As an example, in an observational study of 133 patients (median age 16 years) with testicular torsion, successful manual detorsion (72 patients) was associated with a testicular salvage rate of 97 percent compared with 75 percent salvage in patients in whom detorsion was not attempted or was not successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

It measures about 0.3 cm. The appendix epididymis is a vestigial remnant of the Wolffian duct that is located at the head of the epididymis. The pedunculated shape of these appendages predisposes them to torsion, which can produce scrotal pain that ranges from mild to severe. Torsion of the appendix testis or appendix epididymis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67439\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67439 \">figure 5</a>) occurs most commonly in boys between 7 and 12 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pain of torsion of the appendix testis or appendix epididymis is of sudden onset, like the pain of testicular torsion. </p><p>Physical examination of boys with torsion of the appendix testis or epididymis typically demonstrates a nontender testicle and a tender localized mass that is palpable, usually at the superior or inferior pole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].
