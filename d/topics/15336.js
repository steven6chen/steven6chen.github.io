Most ruptures occur in women who have had a previous transmyometrial surgical incision, typically for cesarean delivery. Rupture of the unscarred uterus is rare, but the incidence is increasing. It is associated with higher major maternal and neonatal morbidity than cases of rupture of the scarred uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review issues related to rupture of the unscarred uterus. Rupture of the scarred uterus is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-rupture-after-previous-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine rupture after previous cesarean delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24771926\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rupture of the unscarred pregnant uterus is a rare event, estimated to occur in <span class=\"nowrap\">1/5700</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/20,000</span> pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. In a study of uterine ruptures in The Netherlands, the incidence of rupture in unscarred and scarred uteri was 0.7 and 5.1 per 10,000 deliveries, respectively; ruptures of unscarred uteri accounted for 13 percent of all ruptures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A study from the United States reported rupture of the unscarred uterus in 4.54 per 100,000 deliveries, or about 1 in 22,000 deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence of rupture in both scarred and unscarred uteri has increased in recent decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Rupture of the unscarred uterus occurs more frequently in resource-limited countries where prompt access to cesarean and instrument-assisted vaginal delivery is not widely available for management of obstructed labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Higher parity and frequency of contracted pelvises may also play a role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24771933\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rupture of an unscarred uterus may be caused by trauma or congenital or acquired weakness of the myometrium. Sources of trauma include motor vehicle accidents and obstetric maneuvers (eg, internal or external version). The myometrium may be inherently weak because of a congenital disorder, such as Ehlers-Danlos type IV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>], or it may become weakened from protracted labor or use of strong uterotonic drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>), which place prolonged stress on the myometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Overdistension of the uterine cavity, whether absolute or relative to the size of the cavity, may be the major physical factor provoking rupture when the myometrium is weakened for any reason.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122632318\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for rupture of the unscarred uterus include high parity (mean parity 3.6 in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]), exposure to uterotonic drugs, uterine anomalies, advancing maternal age, dystocia, macrosomia, multiple gestation, abnormal placentation (eg, placenta accreta, increta, or percreta), and possibly short interpregnancy interval or prior cerclage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/1,17-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17-24</a>]. The presence of several risk factors probably compounds the risk of rupture. In one case report, for example, a grand multiparous woman who experienced rupture of an unscarred uterus at 19 weeks of gestation also had placenta increta and used cocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In another case report, rupture occurred in a woman with a multiple gestation and abnormal placentation, who had used glucocorticoids chronically for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9520951\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of uterotonic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of uterotonic drugs has been a consistent risk factor for rupture of the unscarred uterus. As such, medical induction or augmentation of labor with these drugs is a potentially modifiable risk factor for uterine rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/1,16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,20</a>]. Compared with patients with rupture of the scarred uterus, patients with rupture of the unscarred uterus are more likely to have experienced induction of labor (50 percent versus 18 percent) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> augmentation (80 versus 37 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The safety of uterotonic drugs has improved with development of equipment for accurate drug delivery, timely recognition and appropriate treatment of excessive uterine activity, and better understanding of the indications for beginning and discontinuing these drugs. Nevertheless, rupture of the unscarred uterus has been reported even with low-dose and, presumably judicious, use of uterotonic drugs, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> in the second and third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/16,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,27-29</a>].</p><p>When medical or obstetric induction of labor is indicated, it is prudent to consider whether the patient has other risk factors for rupture of the unscarred uterus. The method of induction in these patients should be individualized, taking into account clinical factors, the likelihood of vaginal delivery, and patient desires. For example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> use has not been associated with rupture of the unscarred uterus in grand multiparous patients in several small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. However, if multiple risk factors are present, such as high parity combined with macrosomia or twins, and vaginal delivery is appropriate, some obstetricians may choose to avoid prostaglandins for cervical ripening and use mechanical methods when cervical ripening is needed. Rupture of the unscarred uterus appears to be a rare event with either the use of mechanical or medical methods of ripening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a meta-analysis of randomized trials of high- versus low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> for induction of labor at term, high-dose oxytocin was associated with a non-statistical increase in the risk of uterine rupture (relative risk 3.10, 95% CI 0.50-19.3; three trials, 1429 women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. There were only five ruptures in the induced cohort. Two occurred in women with prior cesareans (each with two prior cesareans) undergoing oxytocin induction. Three of the ruptures occurred in women with high parity from a single trial included in the meta-analysis. The use of low-dose oxytocin would seem prudent in the grand multiparous population, while a high-dose oxytocin protocol may be reasonable in a low-parity patient. The key factor is closely monitoring the progress of labor and fetal heart rate pattern, with timely intervention for protracted or arrested labor (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal and abnormal labor progression&quot;</a>). Alternatively, the high-parity patient without a history of uterine surgery who requests cesarean delivery to avoid the risk of rupture of the unscarred uterus should be carefully counseled regarding the low risk of rupture and the attendant risks of cesarean in this setting. </p><p>Use of low- and high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> protocols are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin#H7537379\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of labor with oxytocin&quot;, section on 'Oxytocin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24772045\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of rupture can vary depending on the uterine site and the type of labor analgesia so a high index of suspicion is needed. For example, rupture involving the posterior uterus or parametrium in a patient with epidural anesthesia may result in prominent vital sign changes, but minimal patient discomfort or vaginal bleeding. Rupture involving the cervix and upper vaginal wall may present with heavy vaginal bleeding. Rupture involving the bladder may present with the abrupt onset of hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/1,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122632546\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrapartum</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122632444\"><span class=\"h3\">Fetal heart rate changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bradycardia is the most common clinical manifestation of uterine rupture. Bradycardia is sometimes preceded by variable or late decelerations. However, no fetal heart rate pattern is pathognomonic of rupture, and fetal heart rate changes alone are not useful for detecting or excluding rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8210517\"><span class=\"h3\">Loss of station</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A loss of station can be observed if all or part of the fetus passes through the rupture and into the peritoneal cavity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122632457\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal pain with/without hemodynamic changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constant abdominal pain accompanied by signs of intra-abdominal hemorrhage (eg, hypotension, tachycardia, increasing abdominal girth) are consummate signs and symptoms of uterine rupture. However, the degree, character, and location of pain are often variable, and the signs and symptoms of intra-abdominal bleeding can be subtle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/2,3,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,20</a>]. Furthermore, rupture-related pain may be partially or completely masked by neuraxial analgesia for management of labor pain. The acute onset of pain after previously effective neuraxial anesthesia may be a sign of uterine rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122632500\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine tenderness, cessation of contractions, change in uterine shape</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rupture may be accompanied by uterine tenderness, cessation of uterine contractions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a change in uterine shape from extrusion of all or part of the fetus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> amniotic sac. Over 90 percent of uterine ruptures occur in the anterior lower uterine segment, but the corpus, cervix, vaginal wall, posterior uterus, or parametrium may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Intuitively, loss of integrity of the uterine wall should be associated with a reduction in intrauterine pressure, but case series where an intrauterine pressure catheter was in place at the time of rupture have generally not observed pressure changes significantly different from laboring patients without rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. An increase in baseline intrauterine pressure was seen in 4 of 39 patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122632637\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginal bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal bleeding may be modest, despite major intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

In the rare stable patient with a subacute presentation (eg, no or mild abdominal pain, no or light vaginal bleeding, category I or II fetal heart rate tracing), ultrasound imaging of the abdomen may identify a defect in the uterine wall or another pathology accounting for the patient's symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/2,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,39</a>]. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (ie, &quot;FAST&quot; ultrasound) may detect large quantities of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity.</p><p>Laboratory testing is guided by the clinical setting (eg, estimated blood loss, suspected coagulopathy). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122632589\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of uterine rupture is typically made at laparotomy by visualization of complete disruption of all uterine layers with active bleeding and hemoperitoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A high index of suspicion is needed preoperatively in patients with an unscarred uterus since rupture is rare and unexpected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A preoperative provisional diagnosis of rupture is not critical since urgent delivery is often indicated because of fetal heart rate abnormalities.

In contrast to uterine rupture, abruption is associated with increased uterine activity, and the uterus may be tetanic. Abruption can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation, whereas coagulopathy associated with rupture is due to loss of hemostatic factors because of massive hemorrhage.

Likewise, the choice of a midline versus Pfannenstiel incision depends on whether the obstetrician believes the incision-to-delivery time is critical. Intra-abdominal bleeding would not be suspected preoperatively in this setting, so choosing an incision that provides the best exposure of the upper abdomen would not be a consideration unless uterine rupture is suspected because of other clinical findings (eg, loss of station, abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, cessation of contractions, excessive vaginal bleeding); however, this is rare.</p><p>The fetus is delivered using conventional maneuvers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20245559\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine repair versus hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The uterus must be removed or repaired after rupture. Additional surgical goals are to control hemorrhage, identify damage to other organs (eg, urinary tract), and minimize early postsurgical morbidity.</p><p>The decision to perform hysterectomy is based on a combination of factors, including the patient's desire for future pregnancy, the extent of uterine damage from the rupture, the patient's intraoperative hemodynamic and anesthetic stability, and the skill of the surgeon for repairing a complicated rupture. A long and difficult repair of an extensive laceration is not in the woman's best interests if she is hemodynamically unstable or the repair is at high risk of failure in a subsequent pregnancy.

Compared with controls, primary uterine&nbsp;rupture&nbsp;cases had greater composite maternal morbidity (65 versus 20 percent), greater mean blood loss (2644 versus 981 mL), a higher rate of blood transfusion (68 versus 17 percent), and a higher frequency of peripartum hysterectomy (35 versus 2.4 percent). Primary uterine&nbsp;rupture&nbsp;cases had a higher rate of vaginal delivery in the pregnancy with rupture (45 versus 9 percent) and those who delivered vaginally were more likely to ultimately undergo hysterectomy than those delivered by cesarean (63 versus 9 percent). Rates of major composite adverse neonatal neurologic outcomes and death were also higher in cases than in controls (40 versus 12 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4106183\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY AFTER UTERINE RUPTURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8207915\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of recurrent rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on future pregnancies after repair of a ruptured uterus are derived from small case series largely comprised of women who have undergone repair of a ruptured scarred uterus. The risk of recurrent rupture in these publications ranges from 22 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. The risk of recurrence appears to be highest when the uterine fundus was involved in the rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Given the small numbers of rupture of the unscarred uterus, extrapolation of these data to inform management choices in subsequent pregnancies following rupture of the scarred uterus seems reasonable.</p><p>A short interpregnancy interval following cesarean delivery appears to be associated with a higher risk of uterine rupture in women who attempt a trial of labor after a previous low transverse cesarean delivery. Extrapolating from these data, we suggest an interpregnancy interval of at least 18 months for women who desire pregnancy following repair of rupture of the unscarred uterus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications#H1915438\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpregnancy interval and obstetrical complications&quot;, section on 'Trial of labor after cesarean delivery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8208052\"><span class=\"h2\">Predicting recurrent rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scar thickness and integrity may be assessed by ultrasound examination in future pregnancies. An intact, thick scar is reassuring of the integrity of the repair and a thin scar or a defect is worrisome for recurrent rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, the quantitative risk of rupture associated with scar thickness has not been determined, and there are no data for normal myometrial thickness at sites other than the lower uterine segment. Furthermore, women with normal lower uterine segment thickness antepartum have gone on to rupture their uterus when in labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Whether the use of imaging improves outcome needs to be validated, but the authors believe it is prudent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8207921\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent rupture can occur as early as the second trimester and is difficult to predict [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Most obstetricians attempt to reduce the risk of recurrent rupture by recommending cesarean delivery and scheduling the delivery before the onset of labor. There is no consensus on the optimum timing of delivery. </p><p>If the prior rupture involved the fundus, one reasonable approach is to plan repeat cesarean at 36+0 weeks without amniocentesis, but the risks and benefits need to considered on a case-by-case basis. In general, morbidity in late preterm infants is low and considered acceptable when compared with the potential maternal and fetal consequences of recurrent rupture in labor. A course of antenatal corticosteroids is administered 48 hours before the cesarean if not previously administered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery#H2439085123\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;, section on '34+0 or more weeks'</a>.)</p><p>Another reasonable approach is to evaluate fetal pulmonary maturity by amniocentesis at 34 or 35 weeks and perform cesarean delivery upon confirmation of maturity. If test results are not consistent with pulmonary maturity, some obstetricians would give a course of antenatal corticosteroids and deliver the fetus 48 hours later, others would repeat testing in one week, and others would delay delivery until 37+0 weeks. &#160;</p><p>Since the risk of recurrent rupture is lower with a prior lower uterine segment rupture, it is reasonable to delay cesarean delivery until 37+0 weeks of gestation in these cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24772138\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the rarity of rupture of the unscarred uterus, prevention strategies are limited to good obstetrical practice. Fundal pressure in the second stage of labor should be avoided because it can rupture the uterus and is not an effective approach to dystocia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Similarly, procedures that involve uterine manipulation, such as external cephalic version for malpresentation in a woman with a significant uterine anomaly, should be performed gently or not at all (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-cephalic-version#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External cephalic version&quot;, section on 'Risks'</a>). Judicious use of uterotonic agents for induction and augmentation of labor and appropriate use of cesarean delivery for management of protraction or arrest should reduce the risk of rupture of the unscarred normal uterus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of labor with oxytocin&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal and abnormal labor progression&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24772155\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rupture of the unscarred pregnant uterus is a rare event, occurring in <span class=\"nowrap\">1/5700</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/20,000</span> pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H24771926\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rupture of an unscarred uterus may be caused by trauma or congenital or acquired weakness of the myometrium. Contributing factors include dystocia resulting in prolonged labor, exposure to uterotonic drugs, placenta accreta, multiparity, multiple gestations, and advanced maternal age. (See <a href=\"#H122632318\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abnormal fetal heart rate pattern, particularly bradycardia, is the most common clinical manifestation of uterine rupture. Other potential findings include loss of station, abdominal pain with or without hemodynamic instability, uterine tenderness, cessation of contractions, change in uterine shape, vaginal bleeding, and hematuria. Postpartum, abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding unresponsive to uterotonic drugs are signs of rupture. (See <a href=\"#H24772045\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose intrapartum rupture in patients with an unscarred uterus since it is a rare and unexpected event. The diagnosis of uterine rupture is typically made at laparotomy by visualization of complete disruption of all uterine layers with active bleeding. A preoperative provisional diagnosis of rupture is not critical since urgent delivery is often indicated in these patients because of fetal heart rate abnormalities. However, symptoms may be subtle in some cases. (See <a href=\"#H122632589\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24772045\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients, an abnormal fetal heart rate pattern is the dominant factor impacting the decision to perform a cesarean delivery, whether or not uterine rupture is suspected. The choice of anesthesia and type of incision depends on the urgency of the clinical situation and whether upper abdominal pathology is suspected preoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H20245495\" class=\"local\">'Initial approach to intrapartum uterine rupture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive surgical management includes hysterectomy. Depending on patient fertility desires, extent of uterine damage, hemodynamic stability, and the surgeon's skills, uterine repair may be possible. (See <a href=\"#H24772109\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to perform hysterectomy or repair the defect is based on a combination of factors, including the patient's desire for future pregnancy, the extent of uterine damage from the rupture, the patient's intraoperative hemodynamic and anesthetic stability, and the skill of the surgeon for repairing a complicated rupture. (See <a href=\"#H20245559\" class=\"local\">'Uterine repair versus hysterectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the defect is repaired, a reasonable approach is a two- or three-layer closure with an absorbable suture, similar to repair of any hysterotomy. If the laceration extends to the bladder or there is any suspicion of ureteral injury from the laceration or its repair, we suggest an intraoperative consultation with an experienced urologic surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H20245559\" class=\"local\">'Uterine repair versus hysterectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine rupture can lead to multiple adverse and interrelated maternal outcomes, including sequelae of severe hemorrhage, bladder laceration, hysterectomy, and death. Perinatal complications include death or serious morbidity from prolonged intrauterine hypoxia. Uterine rupture can lead to multiple adverse outcomes, including severe hemorrhage, bladder laceration, hysterectomy, and infant death or morbidity from prematurity of hypoxemia. (See <a href=\"#H8207663\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an increased probability of recurrent rupture in a future pregnancy. The risk is related to the site of rupture, with the highest risk likely associated with fundal rupture. We suggest an interpregnancy interval of at least 18 months for women who desire pregnancy following repair of rupture of the unscarred uterus. (See <a href=\"#H4106183\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy after uterine rupture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In future pregnancies, cesarean delivery should be scheduled before labor. We suggest delivery at 36<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</sup></span> to 37<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</sup></span> weeks without confirmation of fetal lung maturity, as this balances neonatal risks of late preterm delivery and complications of scar rupture with the onset of labor. However, other approaches, such as amniocentesis at 34 to 35 weeks with corticosteroid administration if pulmonary immaturity and delivery 48 hours later, are also reasonable.
