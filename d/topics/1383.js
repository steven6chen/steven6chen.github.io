In the United States, the DSM-5 terminology is &ldquo;autism spectrum disorder&rdquo; with particular specifiers for severity and associated conditions (eg, &ldquo;without significant language or intellectual impairment&rdquo;). The autism subgroup addressed in this topic review is included in the DSM-5 as &ldquo;autism spectrum disorder of Level 1 severity without intellectual impairment&rdquo;.

It requires a multidisciplinary approach that makes use of the child's strengths (eg, verbal cognitive ability, formal language skills) to address his or her weaknesses (eg, nonverbal and social problem-solving skills, pragmatic language skills) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As an example, adherence to rules and routines may be exploited to develop positive habits (eg, using verbal algorithms to handle social interactions: &quot;Look, listen, think, and then respond&quot; when engaged in conversation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>].</p><p>The types of interventions that may be used in the management of Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> are described below. These interventions are typically carried out by mental health professionals, developmental pediatricians, and special education personnel. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral and educational interventions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H461586075\" class=\"local\">'Educational plan'</a> below.)</p><p>Effective intervention programs reduce the core symptoms of ASD (symptom reduction) and address the educational and adaptive needs of the child or student to perform as successfully as possible in the world (skills-building). Symptom reduction applies equally to the core symptoms of ASD and any comorbid psychiatric conditions. Skills-building includes all of the skills that children and youth require to function successfully at school, at home, and in the community.</p><p>Approaches may be behaviorally based (eg, based on the principles of Applied Behavioral Analysis that are adult-directed); developmentally based (eg, building skills based on the &ldquo;next steps&rdquo; that the child or student is ready to master); child-centered (eg, based on the child&rsquo;s interests, preferences, or needs); or based on the specific demands and opportunities of the child or student&rsquo;s natural environment (natural learning opportunities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].

There is empirical support from small randomized trials and systematic reviews that demonstrates the effectiveness of a range of programs for children with ASD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-behavioral-and-educational-interventions#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Behavioral and educational interventions&quot;, section on 'Effectiveness'</a>.)</p><p>However, there is no single, comprehensive treatment program for individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span>. Also, no single set of methods or strategies has been identified as being more successful or less successful than any other, though the literature is clear that intervention is better than no intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Although an evidence base for the effectiveness of interventions is emerging, research on effective interventions for students with ASD is limited by numerous methodological limitations. These include inadequate description of the study population or the selection of study subjects; lack of randomization; &quot;type&quot; of ASD being treated (eg, with or without intellectual impairment); lack of experimental design; small study samples. In addition, targets for intervention and outcome measures vary across studies. As examples, studies may use special education placement or IQ as an outcome measure; may use core symptoms such as communication and social skills as an outcome measure; or may target improvements in comorbid symptoms or <span class=\"nowrap\">adaptive/academic</span> progress as outcomes. Treatment consistency and generalization of skills across settings are not always addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141771159\"><span class=\"h1\">FAMILY EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Practitioners can help families make decisions about interventions for their child. They can help families understand the limitations of current evidence and encourage families to request or find programs that have at least some evidence for support. The programs should be multifaceted, including targets such as behavioral regulation, language and communication skills, social skills, and appropriate teaching training and support. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral and educational interventions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H461586075\" class=\"local\">'Educational plan'</a> below.)</p><p>When possible, programs should be described in a manual to ensure consistent or standardized delivery of the intervention. However, treatment consistency and standardization must be balanced with the specific needs of the child (ie, the specific symptoms to be targeted for symptom reduction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the specific skills to be targeted as important to develop for that child) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Generalization of skills is an important aspect of programming. All of the adults in the child&rsquo;s life should be aware of the symptoms that need to be reduced, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the skills that need to be developed. These needs must be addressed across settings by all of the adults involved in the child&rsquo;s care and education, so as to ensure generalization of skills. </p><p>Parents must be aware that not all teachers or paraprofessionals have the training they need to provide quality interventions to students with autism, regardless of the resources that may be available to them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, some teachers may not value research-based interventions over other types of interventions.

Overarousal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anxiety must be addressed, if present, before other interventions can be implemented. The goal is to allow the child to interact with the environment in a more adaptive manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Behavioral and educational interventions for anxiety are discussed here. Psychopharmacologic interventions for anxiety are discussed below.

These therapies may involve graded and systematic stimulation with specific sensory stimuli, which can attenuate the student's over-responsiveness to the stimuli. Other activities, which typically are motor based (eg, swinging, jumping on a trampoline), may be used to calm the child. These activities may need to be offered throughout the day so that the child can participate in learning. The efficacy of sensory integration therapy has not been objectively demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. However, use in individual cases may be warranted if empirical benefit is demonstrated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Teaching a vocabulary for emotions</strong> &ndash; Individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> commonly require specific teaching in the identification of emotions (in self and others) and may also require specific teaching in the use of strategies to help regulate emotions. Once individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> learn to label feelings, they can be taught to use emotion-regulation strategies (eg, sensory or other strategies to regulate feelings; breathing to help refocus on the task at hand). Emotional self-regulation skills can be taught at school or in clinic settings, by occupational therapists (sensory strategies), guidance counselors, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychologists. During the teenage years, mental health services are commonly needed to address anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive-behavioral techniques for emotions </strong>&ndash; The role of formal cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in the treatment of anxiety in individuals with autism spectrum disorder is not yet clear. In CBT for anxiety in children without autism spectrum disorder, the child is taught about anxiety and how to restructure his or her thoughts about the anxiety. The child also is exposed to situations that provoke anxiety and taught how to tolerate those situations more successfully. Such techniques can also be used in children with autism spectrum disorder, though they may need to be embedded into the child&rsquo;s education in communication skills, social skills, and goal-setting skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Parent involvement for emotions</strong> &ndash; Parent involvement in treatment for anxiety, as well as for other aspects of autism, is critical to the child&rsquo;s success.

Executive dysfunctions may be especially evident in individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> have difficulty &quot;seeing the big picture&quot;, which affects social interactions and a wide range of adaptive functions. They tend to over-focus on their preferred topics and interests to the exclusion of completion of other tasks (eg, homework, activities of daily living, social interactions etc). This difficulty with &ldquo;staying focused&rdquo; and &ldquo;seeing the bigger picture&rdquo; is often similar to the type of difficulty seen in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). </p><p>Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> and executive dysfunctions may have problems at school because of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty generalizing knowledge to areas outside the classroom</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty separating relevant from irrelevant information</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A concrete and literal thinking style</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty with problem-solving and organizational skills, affecting homework completion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty multitasking (eg, writing and listening at the same time, which affects the ability to take notes)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty organizing larger tasks such as essays or book reports</p><p/><p>Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> typically do better when they are provided with an environment that is structured, organized, and organizing. Environmental supports such as a clearly established schedule (preferably including a visual schedule) allow the child to anticipate and understand activities, schedules, and expectations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25</a>]. Children with ASD may need extra prompts and reminders to stay on task and to complete tasks. Task lists, organizers, visual schedules, and clearly defined behavioral and learning expectations are important strategies to reduce confusion and its attendant frustration and behavior disturbances, to increase on-task behavior, and to improve learning. These supports consist of strategies that are similar to those used for children with ADHD.

Although they may need instruction in using correct grammar, speech and language therapy for children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> focuses on the use of language in social settings and the nuances of ambiguous language. For example, they need explicit guidance about how the meaning of language can change with the nonverbal components of communication such as changes in tone of voice, or changes in facial expressions and gestures. They also need instruction in how to adapt language (eg, narratives, responses during conversations) to suit the needs of the listener <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the social situation.</p><p>Strategies that may enhance understanding for children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding the use of abstract terms, metaphors, idioms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing instruction that is concrete and explicit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asking the student to repeat what was said</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing frequent interpretations of social events or interactions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using visual supports</p><p/><p>In addition, children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> can be taught about ambiguities in language and can be taught to ask for clarification when they are not sure about what was said (self-advocacy). This facilitates their comprehension during conversations with unfamiliar peers or adults who may not know about their language differences. </p><p>In their expressive communication, children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> can be taught how to adjust their communication to the listener, eg, by changing their tone or voice, or by adjusting the content of their statements in response to the type of listener (eg, nonfamiliar adults, younger or older peers, etc).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H593764402\"><span class=\"h4\">Reading and writing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even with normal intelligence, most children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> require academic support for reading and writing, particularly during the middle and high school years. Some school teams do not recognize the pragmatic language, reading, and writing impairments of children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> and do not provide the necessary support. This may occur because children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> without intellectual impairment usually are verbal and appear knowledgeable. They often perform in the normal range during formal testing situations, in which the child is asked to respond to discrete questions and complete well-defined tasks in a highly structured setting. Parents can advocate for their children by providing examples of the child&rsquo;s difficulty in real-time classroom situations (described in the paragraphs that follow) to school professionals.</p><p>Reading can be challenging for children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD,</span> particularly after they reach grade three or four (ie, age eight or nine years) and when they are required to read passages of text not related to their preferred interest. Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> are likely to focus on irrelevant details in the text. They have a limited capacity to see the &quot;big picture&quot; and to answer comprehension questions that require inference or reasoning skills. </p><p>Organizing the child's approach to reading is an important intervention. Reading comprehension improves when children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> are provided with a systematic method for analyzing text (eg, identifying the topic sentence for each paragraph, summarizing the supporting statements in each paragraph, etc).</p><p>Writing also can be challenging for children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span>. They may write long passages of text that are focused on details and are tangential. Writing instruction includes spelling instruction; instruction in writing sentences; and instruction in writing compositions. Graphic organizers (eg, charts and written algorithms) are useful in helping the student to follow a writing format that includes a main idea with correctly placed supporting details. The current research base suggests that individuals with autism benefit from explicit writing instruction, but specific evidence-based practices are not yet available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Social skills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Social-skills deficits in children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> include impairments in the use of nonverbal behaviors (eg, eye contact, facial expression), failure to develop appropriate peer relationships, and a lack of social or emotional reciprocity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90039\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90039 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Social-skills training programs are designed to teach children the skills to help them to navigate the social environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Social skills intervention programs have measurable benefits, but heterogeneity in the training programs make it difficult to know which components of the program are the most effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. For example, social skills training programs can focus on different goals (eg, building relationships, recognizing and addressing bullying, improving conversational skills, paying attention to nonverbal aspects of social interactions, teaching emotion-regulation skills). Social skills groups are also carried out differently. For example, they may include formal psychotherapeutic techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or they may include parents or peers in the program. </p><p>Although social-skills training is associated with measurable improvements in explicitly taught skills, subsequent performance in real-time social interactions may not reflect the skills acquired in the training setting. Videotaping and role-playing can help to mimic real-life situations, but monitoring by adults outside of formal learning settings is often necessary to assure social success. As such, it is helpful for parents, teachers, and other professionals to reinforce the lessons learned during social skills training sessions by reminding the <span class=\"nowrap\">child/student</span> of social skills lessons and applying them to everyday social interactions at home, at school, and in the community. In a randomized trial that included 60 children with ASD, training that included peers was more effective than isolated social skills instruction in increasing inclusion of children with ASD in playground and classroom activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Social-skills training may include the following areas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic social skills (social conventions). Basic social-skills training teaches social conventions, such as greetings, taking turns, sharing toys or conversational topics, understanding the rules of certain environments, knowing how to speak to unfamiliar adults, etc.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversational skills. Conversational skills are best taught in a group setting. Strategies may include the provision of scripts to help open conversations or manage routine situations in the community (eg, making purchases at the grocery store) or teaching an explicit linear sequence for conversation (&quot;Look, listen, think, and then respond&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social cognition. Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> can be taught to pay attention to the verbal and nonverbal language of social interactions by using linear sequences. They can be asked to identify the words, facial expressions, or gestures and to think about the different meanings that may be intended. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Real-time social participation. Individuals with Asperger syndrome can show successful social reasoning in controlled situations, but do not always access or do not use social reasoning in real-time situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Adults can help children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> in real-life social situations by providing a game plan before the event or situation. The event can be planned out in advance with a picture or list so the child can know what to expect. Once at the event, the child can be taught to use a nonverbal signal to indicate that he or she needs help or to stop what they are doing and respond to the adult when the adult thinks that help is needed. A few scripts can be memorized to initiate social interactions or to help with difficult or confusing situations (eg, &quot;I'm confused, can you please say that another way?&quot;). <br/><br/>Adult supervision is necessary to teach the individual with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> about teasing and bullying (eg, how to differentiate peers who are being friendly versus peers who are not). Adult supervisors can step in and mediate situations that the individual with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> is not able to recognize or manage on his or her own. Adult guidance and supervision is also necessary in the use of the Internet, given the special nature of social interactions that occur via screen-based activities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-advocacy. As they become more familiar with their own differences, individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> can help others understand their limitations. As examples, they can be taught to ask others to repeat statements when they are unsure of what they are being told, or explain to peers that they do not always remember to let others talk or give a peer a turn; they can ask their peers for feedback should this occur.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Adaptive function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adaptive function needs to be assessed throughout the child's school career. Although performance in strictly academic domains may be normal or above average, many individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> perform poorly when asked to complete tasks at home or in the community. They may not be able to order food or behave appropriately in a restaurant, make purchases in a grocery store, manage their personal care, manage household tasks, etc. Academic success is less meaningful if the <span class=\"nowrap\">child/student</span> remains dependent upon adults to manage other, more routine tasks of the day and if the <span class=\"nowrap\">child/student</span> is unable to use knowledge in context.</p><p>Adaptive-skills or life-skills training can form part of the child's social-skills training but may also need to be addressed as a separate component of the child&rsquo;s individualized education program at school or may need to be addressed explicitly at home. Adaptive skills can be taught through scheduling, practicing, and rehearsing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Specific target areas can be identified from scores on adaptive behavior scales (eg, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised, etc). In a systematic review of interventions focused on building adaptive skills, the authors concluded that adaptive skills can improve with behavioral interventions in students with high-functioning autism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461586015\"><span class=\"h3\">Motor skills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Students with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> are often clumsier than their peers and may need accommodations for physical education classes.</p><p>Weaknesses in fine motor skills can affect handwriting, and participation in art classes, industrial art classes, etc. Supports and interventions for fine motor weaknesses include handwriting supports (eg, the use of a keyboard) and adaptive physical education.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461586075\"><span class=\"h2\">Educational plan</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H593764490\"><span class=\"h3\">Essential elements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The education plan is individualized according to the needs of the student. Educational difficulties for children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> may be related to core symptoms, executive dysfunctions, <span class=\"nowrap\">motor/coordination</span> difficulties, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limited adaptive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,34</a>]. Obsessive and restricted range of interests and executive dysfunctions can interfere with social and academic <span class=\"nowrap\">tasks/activities</span>. Limited or atypical social skills can affect classroom participation, as well as performance in the language arts, social sciences, etc. Impairments in pragmatic language can affect reading and writing at the text level. Motor weaknesses may affect handwriting or participation in physical education or recreational activities. </p><p>The education plan should include a formulation of individualized goals and objectives, strategies and supports, and assessment of progress in each of the relevant areas. Specific supports and interventions for core symptoms, executive dysfunctions, motor skills, and adaptive function are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Language and communication skills'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Social skills'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Executive dysfunctions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H461586015\" class=\"local\">'Motor skills'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Adaptive function'</a> above.)</p><p>During the early school years, academic support typically centers on the student's need for organization and structure. After grade four (ie, age nine), academic support also may be necessary for impairments in reading comprehension and written language skills, as well as continued organizational support may be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Executive dysfunctions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H593764402\" class=\"local\">'Reading and writing'</a> above.)</p><p>A complete discussion of the educational interventions for children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> is beyond the scope of this review.

Psychopharmacologic agents do not treat Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> itself and should be initiated only after appropriate educational and behavioral interventions are in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. It is important to address other general health measures, such as regular eating habits, quality nutrition, and adequate sleep before offering a psychopharmacological treatment. Physical exercise may also have positive effects on behavioral regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The principles for the psychopharmacologic management of individuals with Asperger syndrome are the same as the principles for the autism spectrum as a whole, and for individuals with other psychiatric conditions. Medications should be used to target specific symptoms, and symptoms should be measured over time (preferably using rating scales) to monitor efficacy. Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> should have periodic trials off of medication. As the child gains greater understanding and self-confidence, medication may become unnecessary.</p><p>Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> may not respond to psychopharmacologic agents the same way as children with other developmental or psychiatric conditions. Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> are more sensitive to medication effects and more likely to have adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, given their weaknesses identifying and communicating about their emotions and behaviors, it can be difficult to determine the predominant target symptom (eg, anxiety, depression, impulsivity, anger), and, therefore, it can also be difficult to identify the best psychopharmacologic agent.</p><p>Although psychopharmacotherapy for children and adolescents with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> is ideally prescribed by specialists familiar with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> (eg, developmental pediatricians, child psychiatrists, etc), access to such specialists is not always available. Primary care clinicians who undertake the prescription of psychotropic agents to individuals on the autism spectrum should do so in consultation with a developmental pediatrician, a child psychiatrist, or another mental health professional who is familiar with this population to understand target symptoms correctly and to choose an appropriate medication. Medications should be started at lower doses, doses should be increased more slowly, and patients should be monitored for side effects more closely than for patients without Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span>.</p><p>There are few studies on psychopharmacologic interventions in children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome. Most of the information about the psychopharmacologic treatment for Asperger syndrome is extrapolated from studies on autism in general <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> from studies on conditions comorbid with Asperger syndrome, such as anxiety or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies of pharmacotherapy in children with autism generally are small, retrospective, and open label. They typically do not include exposure to behavioral or educational interventions as a first step [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. That being said, there are well-designed randomized controlled trials that demonstrate the beneficial effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a> in the treatment of disruptive behaviors, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylphenidate</a> in the treatment of disruptive behaviors and <span class=\"nowrap\">hyperactivity/inattention</span> in children with autism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-44</a>].</p><p>The psychopharmacologic approaches described below are targeted to specific symptoms and comorbid conditions. No pharmacologic treatments target core social perception or the pragmatic language deficits of Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Anxiety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anxiety may present as fearfulness of certain situations or in response to certain triggers. It can also present as obsessive-compulsive behaviors, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disruptive behaviors and difficulty managing anger.</p><p>Anxiety in children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> is treated with the same therapies that are used to treat anxiety in other children. Pharmacotherapy is one arm of a multimodal approach that may include individual therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and behavioral <span class=\"nowrap\">interventions/incentives;</span> accommodations to address sensory sensitivities; and special education services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The components of the multimodal therapy may vary from patient to patient.</p><p>The role of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in the treatment of anxiety in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. There are no randomized trials that specifically assess the efficacy of SSRI in individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span>. However, in a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in children without ASD, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) were more effective than placebo in reducing core symptoms of anxiety in children and adolescents (58 versus 31 percent, relative risk of response 1.9, 95% CI 1.6-2.26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In addition, in a randomized crossover trial, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoxetine</a> was beneficial in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood and adolescent autism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Given the beneficial effects of SSRI in the treatment of anxiety in children without ASD it is reasonable to try SSRI for children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> who have anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. SSRIs also may be warranted in the treatment of repetitive behaviors, which may be related to anxiety. A lack of controlled, blinded, randomized trials in children with autism prevents firm conclusions about the use of SSRIs in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The choice of SSRI depends mostly on personal preference and familiarity.</p><p>Individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> may respond to very low doses of these agents, but typical pediatric dosing may be necessary. It is important to &quot;start low and go slow&quot;. As a general guideline, the following doses are used in the clinic of the author of this topic:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Fluoxetine</a> is initiated at 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for preschool and early-school-age children, and up to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for teenagers. The dose is titrated upward over the course of several weeks until symptoms improve, using a total dose of 5 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Sertraline</a> is initiated at 12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for preschool and early-school-age children, and 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for teenagers. The dose is titrated upward to a total daily dose of 50 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> over the course of several weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperactivity and inattention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> can be hyperactive, inattentive, and disorganized. These behaviors may be related to comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but may also be due to overarousal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anxiety. If the behaviors do not improve with environmental or behavioral interventions, they may respond to stimulant medications, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atomoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atomoxetine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a>. They may respond to an SSRI if the hyperactivity or inattention is due to anxiety. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Anxiety'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stimulant medications</strong> &ndash; The response rate to stimulants is lower in ASD than it is in ADHD without ASD. In a well-designed randomized trial, effect sizes ranged from 0.29 to 0.54, depending upon dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. This contrasts with effect sizes of 0.73 to 0.96 in children with ADHD without ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Children with ASD also have a higher rate of adverse reactions (eg, irritability, anxiety, and aggression) to stimulant therapy than children without ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Despite the lower response rate and increased risk of adverse effects, a trial of stimulants may be warranted if symptoms of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity do not respond to environmental and behavioral interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].<br/><br/>The use of stimulants and other medications for symptoms of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity is discussed separately. The same treatment strategies used in the treatment of ADHD apply to individuals with Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD</span> who have symptoms of ADHD (ie, use a stimulant medication before using a second-line agent). However, &quot;start low and go slow&quot; is a useful adage to keep in mind. As an example, a preschool or early-school-age child could be started with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylphenidate</a> at 2.5 mg or 5 mg once or twice daily to assess tolerance before titrating upward to assess therapeutic effect. A teenager could be started with methylphenidate 10 mg once or twice daily before titrating upward. In the author&rsquo;s clinic, families are typically asked to use the first dose of the medication on a weekend day so that they can monitor for side effects. If well tolerated and if effective, the child can subsequently be sent to school on medications.

These behaviors may occur in response to anxiety and frustration, often related to rigid thinking patterns and difficulty with social cognition (ie, cognitive features of Asperger <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/ASD,</span> as opposed to strictly emotional ones). If present, these should be the first targets of management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Disruptive behaviors can also be due to anxiety disorders, mood disorders, or impulse control problems. The behavioral and psychopharmacologic agent of choice to treat the behavior depends upon the postulated cause of the disruptive behavior.</p><p>Pharmacotherapy may be indicated if nonpharmacologic therapies are unsuccessful. Pharmacologic interventions may initially be targeted toward anxiety or impulse control. Treatments for anxiety and impulse control problems may not be effective for managing disruptive behaviors, however, at which point treatment with an atypical antipsychotic agent may be warranted. We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a>, an atypical antipsychotic, for disruptive behaviors unresponsive to interventions for anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impulse control problems, or when the disruptive behaviors are believed to be due to anger dysregulation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p>Randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews indicate a positive response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a> in individuals with autism and disruptive behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39-42,58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42,58-60</a>].

Different atypical antipsychotic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clozapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">olanzapine</a>) and different classes of drugs (eg, alpha-2 agonists, anticonvulsant mood stabilizers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a>, SSRI, and beta blockers) have been used to treat disruptive behaviors in children and adolescents with ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,54</a>]. However, there is less clinical experience with these agents, and they are not as well studied as risperidone. Risperidone is the most commonly used antipsychotic for the treatment of disruptive behaviors in children with ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Given its beneficial effects in children with ASD, it is a reasonable therapy for children with Asperger syndrome.</p><p>Adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a> include weight gain, increased appetite, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, and drooling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. Less common but more concerning side effects associated with antipsychotic medications include dystonic reactions, tardive dyskinesia, akathisia (subjective sense of restlessness, often accompanied by voluntary movements of the limbs or trunk), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39,40,42,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40,42,66</a>].</p><p>Children who are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a> should be monitored for adverse effects with routine office visits and periodic blood tests. A consensus statement from the American Psychiatric Association, the American Diabetes Association, and others includes a baseline assessment of weight, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and fasting lipid profile for adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asperger-syndrome-a-specific-autism-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The author's clinic also monitors complete blood count, liver function tests, and an electrocardiogram at baseline, and reassesses weight, blood pressure, fasting glucose, fasting lipid profile, and liver function tests at three months and every three to six months thereafter, depending upon drug dose changes or the discovery of metabolic abnormalities.</p><p>Switching to another antipsychotic agent is commonly recommended if there is excessive weight gain or other adverse effects. </p><p>Discontinuation of medication may be warranted depending upon symptom severity. This is especially true if the individual has been treated for a long interval (ie, a year or more) and would benefit from a trial off medications to reassess efficacy and need for treatment. Withdrawal of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a> and other antipsychotics is often accompanied by a period of behavioral dysregulation.
