However, evidence over the past 20 years indicates that this view is incorrect.</p><p>It is now recognized that insomnia is often an independent disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Insomnia may occur in the absence of coexisting conditions and, when coexisting conditions exist, may persist despite successful treatment of the coexisting condition. Treatment directed at the insomnia and the comorbidity may be necessary. Since insomnia can precipitate, exacerbate, or prolong comorbid conditions, treatment of insomnia may improve comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p>Treatment of insomnia is described in this topic review. The definition, types, epidemiology, clinical features, consequences, and diagnostic evaluation of insomnia are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of insomnia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of insomnia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with insomnia should receive therapy for any medical condition, psychiatric illness, substance abuse, or sleep disorder that may be precipitating or exacerbating the insomnia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50646 \">table 1</a>). They should also receive basic behavioral counseling about sleep hygiene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F71116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71116 \">table 2</a>) and stimulus control (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77189 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>For patients who continue to have insomnia that is sufficiently burdensome to warrant other interventions, treatment options include behavioral therapy, medication, or both:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral therapies beyond sleep hygiene and stimulus control include relaxation, sleep restriction therapy, cognitive therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These therapies are not available in all medical centers. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approved medications used to treat insomnia include benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine sedatives, melatonin agonists, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suvorexant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">suvorexant</a>, an orexin antagonist. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination therapy involves initially prescribing both CBT-I and a medication (usually for six to eight weeks), then tapering the medication off or to an as-needed schedule while continuing CBT-I (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Combination therapy'</a> below). The use of medication prior to the initiation of behavioral therapy appears to be less effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>The choice of treatment should be individualized according to the patient's values and preferences, the availability of advanced behavioral therapies, the severity and impact of the insomnia, and the potential benefits versus the risks, costs, and inconveniences. For most patients, we suggest CBT-I rather than medication as initial therapy, recognizing that both approaches are effective in short-term studies, but that medications have a higher risk of side effects and have been inadequately evaluated for use for longer than a year. However, access to behavioral therapy may be limited in some regions and for some patients groups. A preference for CBT-I or other behavioral therapies over medication as initial therapy has been endorsed in clinical practice guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], the British Association for Psychopharmacology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], the American College of Physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>], and the European Sleep Research Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4162716458\" class=\"local\">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment decisions must also factor in the potential health risks of untreated chronic insomnia, which include decreased quality of life, increased risk for psychiatric comorbidities and substance abuse, decreased performance, and the association between chronic insomnia and risk of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-insomnia-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Consequences'</a>.)</p><p>In clinical practice, initial treatment typically involves sleep hygiene instruction and stimulus control procedures. If follow-up indicates that further treatment is needed, then more formal CBT-I alone or in combination with a medication may be used for six weeks. For patients who respond to therapy (ie, report both improved sleep at night and improvement of daytime deficits), the medication can be tapered or used as needed while continuing the CBT-I. Patients whose symptoms recur after discontinuation of therapy may require re-evaluation for referral for polysomnography or additional CBT-I, with or without pharmacologic therapy. An exception to this approach is patients who have short-term insomnia due to a self-limited stressor; such patients may benefit from short-term medication alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BEHAVIORAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral therapies for insomnia include sleep hygiene education, stimulus control, relaxation, sleep restriction therapy, cognitive therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients whose insomnia has been successfully treated by behavioral therapy are likely to report decreased daytime symptoms and improvement of daytime function, quality of life, and comorbidities. Behavioral therapy is well tolerated and has a low risk of adverse effects, but it is not readily available in many places.</p><p>Behavioral therapy beyond an introduction to sleep hygiene and stimulus control is typically implemented over a series of approximately 6 to 10 sessions. The evidence suggests that the success of the therapy is related to the experience of the individual implementing it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep hygiene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep hygiene refers to actions that tend to improve and maintain good sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F71116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71116 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep as long as necessary to feel rested (usually seven to eight hours for adults) and then get out of bed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain a regular sleep schedule, particularly a regular wake-up time in the morning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try not to force sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid caffeinated beverages after lunch</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid alcohol near bedtime (eg, late afternoon and evening)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid smoking or other nicotine intake, particularly during the evening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjust the bedroom environment as needed to decrease stimuli (eg, reduce ambient light, turn off the television or radio)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid prolonged use of light-emitting screens (laptops, tablets, smartphones, ebooks) before bedtime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resolve concerns or worries before bedtime</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise regularly for at least 20 minutes, preferably more than four to five hours prior to bedtime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>] </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid daytime naps, especially if they are longer than 20 to 30 minutes or occur late in the day</p><p/><p>Sleep hygiene counseling alone has not been directly compared with no intervention or a sham intervention. However, numerous clinical trials have used sleep hygiene counseling alone as the control intervention and showed some improvement in sleep but less than that seen with pharmacotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Stimulus control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with insomnia may associate their bed and bedroom with the fear of not sleeping or other arousing events, rather than the more pleasurable anticipation of sleep. The longer one stays in bed trying to sleep, the stronger the association becomes. This perpetuates the difficulty falling asleep.</p><p>Stimulus control therapy is a strategy whose purpose is to disrupt this association by enhancing the likelihood of sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77189 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients should not go to bed until they are sleepy and should use the bed primarily for sleep (and not for reading, watching television, eating, or worrying). They should not spend more than 20 minutes in bed awake. If they are awake after 20 minutes, they should leave the bedroom and engage in a relaxing activity, such as reading or listening to soothing music. Patients should not engage in activities that stimulate them or reward them for being awake in the middle of the night, such as eating or watching television. In addition, they should not return to bed until they are tired and feel ready to sleep. If they return to bed and still cannot sleep within 20 minutes, the process should be repeated. An alarm should be set to wake the patient at the same time every morning, including weekends. Daytime naps are not allowed.</p><p>Patients may not improve immediately. However, accumulating sleepiness will facilitate sleep during successive nights.</p><p>Stimulus control therapy has improved sleep in randomized trials and its effects may be long lasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. One study suggested that stimulus control therapy is more effective among patients who are not already taking medications for insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Relaxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relaxation therapy may be implemented before each sleep period. There are two common techniques for relaxation therapy: progressive muscle relaxation and the relaxation response.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive relaxation is based upon the theory that an individual can learn to relax one muscle at a time until the entire body is relaxed. Beginning with the muscles in the face, the muscles are contracted gently for one to two seconds and then relaxed. This is repeated several times. The same technique is used for other muscle groups, usually in the following sequence: jaw and neck, upper arms, lower arms, fingers, chest, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, calves, and feet. This cycle is repeated for approximately 45 minutes, if necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relaxation response begins by lying or sitting comfortably. The eyes are closed and relaxation is allowed to spread throughout the body. A relaxed, abdominal breathing pattern is established. Thoughts are redirected away from everyday thoughts and toward a neutral mental focusing device, such as a peaceful word or image.</p><p/><p>One trial randomly assigned 57 patients with insomnia to receive progressive relaxation therapy or no therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Progressive relaxation therapy improved measures of sleep, but not daytime function. Another randomized trial similarly found improvement in sleep measures among patients who received relaxation therapy compared with a sham therapy, but the improvement was modest and smaller than that achieved with cognitive behavioral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Slow-paced breathing prior to sleep onset as a means of reducing vagal activity has been shown to improve sleep parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep restriction therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with insomnia stay in bed longer to try to make up for lost sleep. This causes a circadian shift and a reduction in the homeostatic drive that makes sleep onset the following night more difficult and results in the need to stay in bed even longer. Sleep restriction therapy counteracts this tendency by limiting the total time allowed in bed, including naps and other sleep periods outside of bed, in order to increase the drive to sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This consolidates sleep and improves sleep efficiency (the percentage of time in bed that the patient is asleep).</p><p>Sleep restriction therapy begins by decreasing the time spent in bed to the same amount of time that the patient reports sleeping (usually determined from sleep diaries or logs completed by the patient), but not less than five hours per night (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69303 \">table 4</a>). On a daily basis, the patient reports the amount of sleep obtained the previous night and the amount of time spent in bed. The clinician then computes the sleep efficiency, which is the reported time asleep divided by the reported time in bed. The time in bed is increased by 15 to 30 minutes once the sleep efficiency exceeds 85 percent. This process is repeated until the patient reports improved sleep without residual daytime sleepiness. However, total time in bed for some patients can remain at six hours or less for long periods of time. Naps are not permitted.</p><p>To improve compliance, the rationale for the therapy needs to be carefully explained to patients and some care needs to be used to determine and schedule the time in bed in a manner that maximizes the ability to sleep and is acceptable to the patient. Older patients tend to have more difficulty maintaining sleep even when restricted; therefore, they are given more lenient criteria.</p><p>A 2014 systematic review identified four randomized trials of sleep restriction therapy as a stand-alone therapy versus another intervention or control for chronic insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The weighted effect sizes for improvement in subjective sleep variables were medium to large and comparable to those achieved with cognitive behavioral interventions in other meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In the largest individual study, 179 older adults with primary insomnia were randomly assigned to six weeks of sleep restriction therapy, stimulus control therapy, a multicomponent behavioral intervention, or wait-list control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. All treatments resulted in significant improvements in diary-reported sleep outcomes compared with control, and there was no advantage to a multicomponent intervention over a single component intervention. Effect sizes were generally moderate to large and maintained at 3 and 12 months post-treatment.</p><p>Potential adverse effects of sleep restriction therapy include increased daytime sleepiness and decreased reaction times, as well as possible exacerbation of bipolar disorder. (See <a href=\"#H1050407327\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are awake at night commonly become concerned that they will perform poorly the next day if they do not obtain adequate sleep. This worry can exacerbate their difficulty falling asleep, creating a vicious cycle of wakefulness and concern. A person may begin to blame all negative events in their life on poor sleep. During cognitive therapy, a person works with a therapist to deal with anxiety and catastrophic thinking, while establishing realistic expectations related to insomnia and the need for sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a strategy that combines several of the previously described approaches over several weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A sample eight-session CBT-I program may include an introductory sleep education session, followed by two sessions that focus on stimulus control and sleep restriction. These may be followed by two sessions that focus on cognitive therapy and then a session on sleep hygiene. Finally, there may be a session that reviews and integrates the previous session and a session that addresses future problems, such as stress and relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Patients are encouraged to complete sleep logs as they learn and apply the various strategies. This allows improvement to be measured.</p><p>The advantage of the educational nature of CBT-I is that it provides patients with tools to apply in the future. Disadvantages of CBT-I include the duration of therapy and the relatively few clinicians who are skilled at all of its components. The benefit of CBT-I may be reduced when it is administered by less experienced clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>CBT-I has proven efficacious in moderate- to high-quality randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/1,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37,38</a>]. A 2015 meta-analysis identified 20 randomized trials of CBT-I for chronic insomnia in over 1100 participants; CBT-I approaches incorporated at least three of the following: cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Compared with inactive control conditions, CBT-I improved sleep on a variety of outcome measures, including sleep onset latency (improved by 19 minutes), wake time after sleep onset (decreased by 26 minutes), and sleep efficiency (improved by 10 percent). The benefits of CBT-I appeared to persist beyond the active treatment period. Separate meta-analyses of trials in patients with insomnia comorbid with medical, sleep, or psychiatric disorders have found similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p>Several randomized studies have suggested that alternative delivery methods such as telephone-based CBT-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>] and internet-based CBT-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/43-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-48</a>] may be effective treatment options that could overcome some of the access and economic barriers that exist for traditional CBT-I. As an example, one trial recruited 303 patients with chronic insomnia via the internet and randomly assigned them to receive a six-week interactive, fully automated web-based CBT-I program or a control condition (access to an educational website) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. At six weeks, patients assigned to CBT-I showed greater improvement in subjective sleep measures, including 41 percent who achieved remission of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index &lt;8). Remission rates also favored the intervention at one year (57 versus 27 percent), although subjective total sleep times were similar between groups.</p><p>Despite these results, larger studies are needed that directly compare alternative delivery methods with face-to-face CBT-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In a small trial comparing face-to-face and guided online CBT-I with a wait-list control in 90 patients with insomnia, both delivery methods performed significantly better than the wait-list control, but face-to-face CBT-I was associated with larger treatment effects and better depression and anxiety outcomes than online delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>CBT-I is particularly recommended for use in patients where medications are contraindicated or may be more likely to produce side effects, such as in older adults, pregnant women, or patients with renal, hepatic, or pulmonary disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5450296\"><span class=\"h2\">Other approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other behavioral therapies that may emerge as useful in the treatment of insomnia include mindfulness meditation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>] and exercise training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, a small randomized trial comparing tai chi with CBT-I in older adults found that CBT-I was associated with greater and more sustained improvement in sleep quality, fatigue, and depressive symptoms than tai chi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1050407327\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse effects of behavioral therapy have not been well described, but one area of caution relates to sleep restriction. Sleep restriction decreases sleep latency and increases sleep efficiency by causing sleep deprivation (ie, total sleep time is decreased, not increased). In one study, subjects reported increased sleepiness and had slower reaction times during a four-week treatment period that then returned to baseline three months later, when time in bed had increased to about seven hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. These effects are similar to those seen during chronic partial sleep deprivation and suggest that patients using this therapy should be carefully monitored and instructed to avoid hazardous activity and driving when time in bed has been significantly reduced. Sleep restriction should be used with caution in patients with underlying bipolar disorder, since sleep deprivation can trigger manic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3553718232\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of an agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications or classes of medications that are approved to treat insomnia include benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, melatonin agonists, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suvorexant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">suvorexant</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Although all of these agents or classes have been shown to be more effective than placebo at improving short-term sleep outcomes, the magnitude of effect is variable; most trials have been industry sponsored, raising concerns about publication bias; and confidence in the overall estimation of risk-to-benefit ratio is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The potential benefits of pharmacologic therapy on sleep quality and daytime function are balanced against the risk of side effects as well as physical and psychological addiction with long-term use. These risks may be increased in certain clinical settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy &ndash; Sedative-hypnotics may increase the risk of fetal malformations if used during the first trimester.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol consumption &ndash; Sedative-hypnotics should not be combined with alcohol because there is a risk of excessive sedation and respiratory suppression whenever central nervous system suppressants are combined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal or hepatic disease &ndash; Most sedative-hypnotic medications undergo hepatic and renal clearance.

This is a consequence of multiple comorbidities and central nervous system changes associated with aging.

Whether prescription of a hypnotic drug in patients with insomnia modifies the risk of suicidality is not conclusively known. Randomized trials in patients with insomnia have not found a difference in suicidality in patients treated with hypnotics compared with placebo.

The medication is then tapered off or to an as-needed schedule, while continuing the CBT-I.</p><p>Two trials from the same investigators illustrate the effects of combination therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first trial randomly assigned 78 patients with persistent insomnia to receive CBT-I alone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temazepam</a> alone, CBT-I plus temazepam, or placebo for eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. At the end of the treatment phase, all of the therapies had significantly decreased the wake time after sleep onset compared with placebo, although there were no significant differences when the treatment groups were compared with each other. Two years following the completion of treatment, only the CBT-I alone group had maintained its reduction in the wake time after initial sleep onset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second trial randomly assigned 160 patients with persistent insomnia to receive CBT-I plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a> or CBT-I alone for six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. Both groups had decreased sleep onset latency, decreased wake time after sleep onset, and increased sleep efficiency when compared with baseline after six weeks. However, there was no significant difference in the remission rate when the groups were compared with each other (44 versus 39 percent). The patients then underwent secondary randomization. Patients in the CBT-I alone group were randomly assigned to no treatment or maintenance CBT-I, while patients in the CBT-I plus zolpidem group were randomly assigned to either maintenance CBT-I or maintenance CBT-I plus as-needed zolpidem. The improvement of sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency was maintained in all groups at 6, 12, and 24 months, with slight advantage to maintenance CBT-I without continued use of zolpidem as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>].</p><p/><p>Taken together, the evidence indicates that CBT-I alone, drug therapy alone, and combination therapy all improve measures of insomnia (eg, wake time after sleep onset) within weeks of initiating the therapy. Continuing CBT-I alone after the completion of initial therapy appears to be the best option for maintaining improvement long-term. CBT-I also increases the likelihood that the medication can eventually be tapered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>].</p><p>If sleep restriction therapy is combined with hypnotic medication, clinicians should be aware that the combination of chronic partial sleep deprivation and medication hangover could significantly increase daytime sleepiness and behavioral risk. (See <a href=\"#H1050407327\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.) </p><p>The evidence is insufficient to justify combination therapy as routine initial management for insomnia patients. Many patients will improve with CBT-I alone, without pharmacologic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the treatment is successful, patients will report both improved sleep at night and improvement of daytime deficits. Discontinuation of the medication should be considered in any patient who is receiving pharmacologic therapy alone or combination therapy.</p><p>Patients who have little improvement during the initial trial of cognitive behavioral therapy, pharmacologic therapy, or combination therapy may have other causes of poor sleep. Adherence with the prescribed therapy should be confirmed and then additional diagnostic evaluation performed. Such patients often require referral to a sleep disorders center to be evaluated for sleep apnea or other underlying causes. Such an evaluation is indicated earlier (ie, prior to the failure of routine therapy) if there is clinical suspicion that sleep apnea or another etiology exists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of insomnia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other patients may respond initially to pharmacologic therapy but later relapse while still taking the same drug. In such cases, clinical re-evaluation is warranted to determine whether there are lifestyle changes or other new factors that may be exacerbating the insomnia. There are limited data on tolerance and cross-tolerance among various medications used to treat insomnia, but some amount of tolerance likely exists for the benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults/abstract/146-148\" class=\"abstract_t\">146-148</a>].</p><p>Treatment decisions in patients with possible tolerance must be individualized, taking into account factors such as side effects, duration of therapy, prior therapies, and availability of alternative options, such as behavioral therapy. If lifestyle changes and other exacerbating factors have been ruled out, we consider the following approaches:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient who complains of loss of efficacy from a short-acting nonbenzodiazepine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a>, we suggest a trial of a longer-acting drug, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eszopiclone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eszopiclone</a>, or switch to medication from a different class, such as low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients may benefit from a drug holiday, after which time they may again respond to the initial drug therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Institution of behavioral therapy can help transition some patients away from long-term use of a benzodiazepine or nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonist.

They should also receive general behavioral suggestions, particularly advice regarding sleep hygiene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F71116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71116 \">table 2</a>) and stimulus control (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77189 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who continue to have insomnia that is severe enough to require an intervention, we suggest cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the initial therapy rather than medication (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). An alternative type of behavioral therapy is reasonable if CBT-I is not available. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients whose insomnia continues to be severe enough to require an intervention despite CBT-I, we suggest the addition of a medication to CBT-I rather than changing to a strategy of medication alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require medication for sleep onset insomnia, we suggest a short-acting medication rather than a longer-acting agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3553718232\" class=\"local\">'Choice of an agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require medication for sleep maintenance insomnia, we suggest a longer-acting medication rather than a short-acting agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Alternatively, a formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a> has been approved for use in the middle of the night. Patients should be warned about the risk for daytime drowsiness, impaired driving, dizziness, and lightheadedness. (See <a href=\"#H3553718232\" class=\"local\">'Choice of an agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients given behavioral plus pharmacologic therapy should continue behavioral therapy for six to eight weeks. In patients who respond to therapy, the medication can be tapered while continuing the behavioral therapy. Patients whose symptoms recur may require evaluation in a sleep disorders center, prior to the institution of long-term therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term treatment with medication alone is not the optimal treatment strategy for patients with insomnia.
