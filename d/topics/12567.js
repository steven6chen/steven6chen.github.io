An ostomy can be created virtually anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. For diversion of the fecal stream, the most common ostomies involve the distal small intestine (eg, ileostomy) and large intestine (ie, colostomy).</p><p>Temporary or permanent fecal diversions may be needed to manage a variety of pathologic conditions, including congenital anomalies, colon obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease, traumatic disruption of the intestinal tract, or gastrointestinal malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Overall, the number of fecal diversions appears to be declining.</p><p>The principles of ostomy construction for the purpose of fecal diversion, including types, site selection, and creation is reviewed here. The routine care and management of common ostomy complications are reviewed separately.

As an example, patients who are at high risk for anastomotic leak (eg, malnourished, high dose steroids), who have an intestinal anastomosis &lt;5 to 7 cm from the anal verge (low anastomosis below the peritoneal reflection), or who are hemodynamically unstable (eg, trauma, sepsis) may benefit from a temporary ostomy until continuity of bowel can be restored safely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Fecal diversions are commonly classified according to the segment of the bowel used to create the ostomy (eg, sigmoid, colon, ileum) and the manner of surgical construction (eg, loop, end, reservoir).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H314988618\"><span class=\"h2\">Ileostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ileostomy (temporary or permanent) is performed when it is necessary to remove or bypass the entire colon and rectum, or to protect a distal colorectal, coloanal, or ileoanal anastomosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70992\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70992 \">picture 1</a>). An ileostomy can be constructed either as a diverting loop stoma or end-stoma, with or without a continent reservoir.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H314988754\"><span class=\"h3\">Diverting loop ileostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Temporary loop ileostomy is preferred over colostomy for protecting a distal colorectal anastomosis, or coloanal anastomosis following a sphincter-saving rectal resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. A loop of terminal ileum is brought out through the abdominal wall, opened, and sutured to the dermis and stabilized with a rod or bridge until the bowel granulates to the abdominal wall. (See <a href=\"#H398100146\" class=\"local\">'Loop ostomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Temporary diversion is generally reserved for patients considered high-risk for anastomotic breakdown, such as patients with previous irradiation of the pelvis, those on medications that impair wound healing such as steroids, immunosuppressive or biologic agents, or those with a low colorectal anastomosis (&lt;5 to 7 cm form anal verge) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. It is frequently used following ileoanal pouch procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70246 \">figure 1</a>). Although data are inconclusive on the effects of immunosuppressive medications on anastomotic healing, many surgeons still protect the primary anastomosis with a temporary diverting loop ostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].

An alternative approach is the continent ileal reservoir. (See <a href=\"#H314988881\" class=\"local\">'Continent ileostomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Brooke's technique, which involves eversion of the bowel to expose the mucosa followed by mucocutaneous suturing to create an end stoma, is the accepted approach for creation of an end-stoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72724\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72724 \">figure 2</a>). A Brooke ileostomy protrudes 2 to 3 cm above skin level, which promotes drainage of the effluent into the pouch and allows secure application of the stoma appliance. This reduces skin irritation by minimizing spillage of enzymatic effluent beneath the pouching system, and prevents the development of serositis and potential stricture. The afferent or proximal limb of a diverting loop ileostomy is also often created with a Brooke&rsquo;s everting stitch while the distal efferent limb is sutured directly to the skin. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H314988881\"><span class=\"h3\">Continent ileostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The continent (permanent) ileostomy is performed by surgeons who specialize in this type of procedure. The stoma and ileal reservoir are intubated by the patient on a regular basis to provide elimination of reservoir contents. Continent ileal reservoirs are associated with a fairly high reoperation rate, most commonly due to slippage of the continence mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As a result, they are limited to patients who desire a continent procedure and who are not candidates for an ileal-anal pouch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64517\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64517 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. A continent ileal reservoir is contraindicated in patients with Crohn disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications#H3285925\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine care of patients with an ileostomy or colostomy and management of ostomy complications&quot;, section on 'Nipple valve slippage'</a>.)</p><p>The continent ileal reservoir, originally performed by Nils Kock, involves the creation of an internal pouch fashioned from detubularized ileum and rendered continent by intussuscepting the segment of ileum connecting the reservoir to the abdominal stoma. The original procedure was modified by Barnett, who added an ileal &quot;collar&quot; (a segment of ileum looped around the intussuscepted segment of bowel and connecting to the reservoir) that improved continence (Barnett Continent Ileal Reservoir [BCIR]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66598\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66598 \">figure 4</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60235532\"><span class=\"h2\">Colostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A colostomy is performed when it is necessary to bypass or remove the distal colon, rectum, or anus, and it is either inadvisable or not feasible to restore gastrointestinal continuity. If the distal rectum and anorectal sphincter mechanism are removed, the colostomy is permanent; however, if the sphincter mechanism is preserved there is the potential for ostomy reversal. As with ileostomies, colostomies may be created in a loop or end fashion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60235538\"><span class=\"h3\">Temporary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A temporary &quot;diverting&quot; colostomy can be performed on an emergency basis to decompress an obstructed or perforated distal colon. A temporary colostomy may also be performed electively to facilitate healing of perianal sepsis (ie, fistulas or perineal wounds) or acute inflammatory process distal to the colostomy. Diverting colostomy may also be used to protect a low-lying colorectal anastomosis when delayed healing is anticipated (eg, postradiation) or risk of anastomotic complications are high. Still, the preferred type of ostomy for this purpose is a &ldquo;diverting&rdquo;<strong> loop ileo</strong>stomy given the relative ease of reversal compared with loop colostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/5,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20,21</a>].

In addition, a colostomy allows the dilated proximal bowel to regain normal caliber, which may facilitate subsequent intestinal anastomosis. </p><p>The most commonly performed decompressing colostomies are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transverse loop colostomy &ndash; A loop of transverse colon is brought out through the abdominal wall, opened, and sutured to the dermis and stabilized with a rod or bridge until the bowel granulates to the abdominal wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cecostomy &ndash; The anterior wall of the cecum is opened and sutured to an opening in the abdominal wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sigmoid loop colostomy &ndash; A sigmoid loop colostomy is similar to the transverse loop colostomy and useful for patients with a redundant sigmoid colon and an obstructive rectal or anal cancer.</p><p/><p>Decompressing colostomies are typically temporary. A staged approach to colon resection using a decompressing colostomy is often beneficial by reducing the risk of abdominal contamination and enabling definitive management of the underlying disease process to be performed electively rather than emergently. However, the need for an additional separate procedure to reverse the ostomy, and for some patients, problems related to self-care and maintenance of a secure pouching system are particular disadvantages to the creation of a colostomy and should not be overlooked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60235620\"><span class=\"h4\">Colostomy for fecal diversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loop ileostomy is a safer diversion with lower morbidity rates in situations where temporary diversion is required, such that diverting colostomy is being used less frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H314988754\" class=\"local\">'Diverting loop ileostomy'</a> above.)</p><p>Nevertheless, colostomy can be used to divert the fecal stream proximal to a fistulous tract (entero-vaginal,-vesicular or &ndash;urethra), an area of inflammation (proctitis or peri-anal sepsis), unresectable distal malignancy, or for protection of a distal anastomosis. In these settings, fecal diversion promotes quiescence of the disease process or healing of the anastomotic site. A colostomy can also be used in the setting of fecal incontinence in which patients who have failed conservative management or who are not candidates for other surgical intervention. </p><p>Approaches to temporary diverting colostomy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A loop colostomy is created by bringing a loop of colon up to the abdominal wall. The ostomy is created with a proximal end (afferent limb) that allows fecal diversion and a distal end that allows venting of the distal length of bowel (efferent limb), thereby minimizing the potential for perforation of the distal colon or rectum (in the setting of obstruction). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An end-loop colostomy is created by exteriorizing a loop of colon, dividing the colon with a linear stapler, allowing the distal end to recess into the subcutaneous space, and using the proximal end to create the stoma. These end-loop colostomies are generally created when there is concern for ischemia of the bowel segment due to a foreshortened mesentery; the loop allows for additional length over an end stoma. If one is concerned for persistent distal obstruction, the surgeon may mature the distal limb adjacent to the proximal limb as a mucous fistula.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A double barrel stoma is created by transecting the bowel and bringing each end up to the abdominal wall as separate stomas (eg, a proximal functional colostomy and a distal mucous fistula), usually adjacent one another.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Hartmann&rsquo;s procedure brings the proximal end of the transected bowel up to the abdominal wall as an end-colostomy, while the distal end is oversewn or stapled and left in the abdominal cavity as a nonfunctional stump (usually tagged with a suture to facilitate future identification). The distal end can also be secured in place adjacent the colostomy as a mucous fistula in the subcutaneous tissue, but not matured out to the skin. Creation of the mucus fistula is performed when there is a high likelihood of breakdown of the defunctionalized stump, which can lead to abdominal sepsis. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60235832\"><span class=\"h3\">Permanent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When permanent fecal diversion is required, a colostomy is often beneficial due to a decrease risk for dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities associated with permanent ileostomy, which is particularly beneficial in older patients. (See <a href=\"#H398098449\" class=\"local\">'End-ileostomy'</a> above.)</p><p>Clinical settings that may warrant construction of a permanent colostomy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal perineal resection for rectal cancer </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fecal incontinence related anal outlet dysfunction or perianal sepsis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total abdominal proctocolectomy for severe Crohn colitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total abdominal proctocolectomy for severe ulcerative colitis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21062994\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION AND COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative preparation prior to planned ostomy creation includes stoma site selection, emotional support, and patient education, as well as early planning for subsequent discharge, ongoing rehabilitation care for the patient and family, and outpatient follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Patients who require an ostomy for fecal diversion often experience physical, psychological, and emotional stress related to misconceptions and fears regarding social acceptance, sexuality, and economic burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. To allay these fears, preoperative education, counseling, and ostomy site selection should be undertaken, whenever possible, from a skilled ostomy nurse specialist (enterostomal therapy nurse, wound ostomy continence nurse). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21063003\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education and counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative counseling by an ostomy nurse specialist improves postoperative quality of life by helping patients psychologically adapt to the significant lifestyle changes associated with living with a stoma. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that involvement of an ostomy nurse specialist has a significant impact on long-term positive outcomes and reduced complication rates, as does involvement in ostomy support groups such as the United Ostomy Association of America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/19,26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26-30</a>].</p><p>In addition to improved overall quality of life, preoperative counseling is associated with decreased stoma-related postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31</a>], improved postoperative patient stoma proficiency, and earlier discharge from the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21063010\"><span class=\"h2\">Site selection and marking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In retrospective reviews, proper site selection is essential for minimizing postoperative complications and achieving a good postoperative quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/27,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,35,36</a>]. A poor site selection is more likely in patients undergoing emergency surgery compared with elective surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/31,35,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35,37,38</a>]. A multicenter retrospective review of 748 patients found that those who had preoperative stoma site markings were significantly less likely to develop later problems and complications compared with those without preoperative stoma site markings (23 versus 46 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Typically, the site is selected preoperatively with collaboration of the enterostomal nurse, the surgeon, and the patient. In the absence of an ostomy nurse specialist, such as with urgent or emergent surgery, particularly during off hours, preoperative stoma site selection and patient counseling by an experienced surgeon is also appropriate. Follow-up counseling with an ostomy nurse specialist in the postoperative period is particularly important and recommended since postoperative stomal complications are more common when constructed on an emergent basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/31,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,37-39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications#H60242904\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine care of patients with an ileostomy or colostomy and management of ostomy complications&quot;, section on 'Ostomy complications'</a>.)</p><p>Factors to consider preoperatively with respect to stoma placement include abdominal wall contour (sitting and standing), prior abdominal incisions, bony prominences, occupation, clothing style (belt line), disability, and any physical limitations. Suboptimal stoma placement increases the risk of complications and worsens quality of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications#H60242535\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine care of patients with an ileostomy or colostomy and management of ostomy complications&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>To optimize pouch adherence and independence in self-care, the following general principles should be followed when identifying the ostomy site:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ostomy should lie on either side of the abdominal midline, just lateral and inferior to the umbilicus. Often, a site is selected that overlays the rectus abdominis muscle, which can provide additional support and stability for the stoma. (See <a href=\"#H21063032\" class=\"local\">'Create the aperture'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient must be able to visualize the stoma and access it without difficulty. In obese patients, the stoma often must be located higher on the abdominal wall (above the umbilicus), where the stoma may be more visible to the patient and the abdominal wall is less thick. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ostomy placement ideally must be at least 5 cm from all folds, creases, previous incisions, belt line, umbilicus, and bony prominences because these can interfere with appliance adherence. This is particularly important in obese patients or those who have had prior abdominal surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of an emergent procedure without preoperative stoma site markings, a reasonable location is two-thirds the way along the line from the anterior superior iliac spine and the umbilicus. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H314989938\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF LAPAROSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laparoscopic approach is a safe and effective alternative to a laparotomy for creating loop ostomies, particularly loop ileostomy or loop sigmoid colostomy, since these do not typically require significant bowel mobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-45</a>]. Laparoscopy is our preferred approach when the principle indication for the procedure is the need for a defunctioning stoma (eg, relief of a bowel obstruction), provided the likelihood of adhesions is low (absence of multiple previous surgeries). </p><p>Advantages of the laparoscopic approach are that it provides an excellent view of the abdominal cavity and minimizes the risks and complications of an open procedure. A prospective study included 19 patients undergoing a laparoscopic approach for constructing a stoma and compared their results with historic controls of 23 patients undergoing a laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The laparoscopic approach was associated with significantly lower postoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> requirements (48 versus 90 mg), earlier time to return of bowel function (2.2 versus 3.6 days), earlier tolerance of solid diet (3.6 versus 5.5 days), and fewer postoperative complications (1 of 19 versus 4 of 23 patients). Conversion rates from a laparoscopy to a laparotomy range from 0 to 16 percent and are mainly related to adhesions from previous surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. </p><p>Several techniques have been described, varying in location and number of port sites. The author prefers a three-port technique for a loop or end ileostomy. Access to the peritoneal cavity is achieved using standard techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A 12 mm port is placed at the preselected stoma site. The entire abdominal cavity is examined visually. If feasibility is confirmed, two additional 5 mm ports are placed in the suprapubic and left iliac fossa, two fingerbreadths above and two fingerbreadths medial to the anterior superior iliac spine. If adhesions limit visibility and accessibility to the segment of bowel to be used for the ostomy, the procedure can be converted to a laparotomy. A similar approach is used for sigmoid loop or end colostomy, but the lateral working ports are positioned in a mirror image to those placed for a loop ileostomy. </p><p>Single port techniques have also been described. Abdominal access is obtained at the previously determined site and pneumoperitoneum is established. Once the anatomy has been confirmed, the selected loop of intestines is brought out through the aperture. Careful attention is taken to maintain the correct orientation, as confirming the orientation is quite difficult in single port surgery. As such, single incision surgery should be reserved for more advanced laparoscopists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891400\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Advanced access techniques'</a>.)</p><p>When creating an end or loop sigmoid ostomy laparoscopically, the bowel is mobilized in the lateral to medial direction, extending from the rectosigmoid to the middescending colon. Mobilization of the mesentery is generally not necessary, except in the presence of abdominal or pelvic adhesions. The aperture is created and matured to the skin as described below. Prior to maturing the stoma, the proper orientation of the bowel must be verified.

Large apertures increase the risk for parastomal hernia, while small apertures can result in ischemia, stricture, stomal outlet obstruction strictures, or stomal necrosis. The skin and fascial openings should be large enough to pull the selected intestine through the abdominal wall without occluding the mesenteric vessels and intestinal lumen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79596\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79596 \">figure 5</a>).

The circular portion of subcutaneous tissue is dissected using knife or electrocautery, and the anterior rectus fascia cleared. A 2 cm vertical or cruciate incision (&ldquo;plus sign&rdquo;) is made in the anterior rectus fascia. The author prefers a 2 cm vertical incision that minimizes fascial disruption and allows two finger breadths to pass snugly for both ileostomy and colostomy. Often, a colostomy will require a larger trephine to allow easy passage of the intestine through the abdominal wall, decrease tension, avoid ischemia, and minimize venous congestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68865\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68865 \">figure 6</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21063053\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic mesh</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-quality data regarding prophylactic placement of mesh at the time of permanent ostomy construction to reduce the risk of parastomal hernia formation remain limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. </p><p>Several systematic reviews evaluated the outcomes of randomized trials and concluded that prophylactic&nbsp;use of&nbsp;mesh&nbsp;at the time of stoma formation reduces hernia formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. The incidence of parastomal hernia was significantly lower when prophylactic mesh was used compared with no mesh (12.5 versus 53 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, a later multicenter, randomized trial compared prophylactic parastomal reinforcement using biologic mesh with controls and found similar incidences of parastomal hernias at two years (12.2 percent of the porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix group and 13.2 percent of controls). Of note, this study included a high percentage of ileostomies which historically have a low incidence of parastomal hernia herniation. </p><p>At this time, the data regarding the role of biologic mesh and reducing parastomal hernia remain unclear; however, placement of prosthetic or biologic mesh adjacent the bowel appears to be safe with overall low rates of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/48,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,51</a>]. More randomized trials are ongoing and due to be published in the next few years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60239205\"><span class=\"h3\">Location of mesh</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effectiveness of using mesh for reducing the risk of a parastomal hernia may depend upon the location of mesh placement, and possibly the type of mesh. Mesh is placed in a manner similar to the repair of parastomal hernia, but at the time of primary stoma formation. In order of preference, the mesh can be placed in a sublay, onlay, or intraperitoneal position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82341 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/47,52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,52-56</a>].

The sublay technique is the most frequently used and our preferred approach. In three randomized trials, ostomy creation using prophylactic mesh in the sublay position was compared with no mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/47,54,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,54,57</a>]. Prophylactic mesh significantly reduced the risk of a parastomal hernia (range 0 to 22 versus 44 to 81 percent). There were no differences in the incidence of complications between the groups (eg, stomal infection, necrosis, stenosis). </p><p>To place sublay mesh during ostomy creation, after creating the aperture in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, the rectus muscle is split in the direction of its fibers, and the posterior rectus sheath is incised. The plane is developed between the rectus muscle and the posterior rectus sheath (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72219 \">figure 8</a>). A circular opening is made in the center of a 6 by 6 cm biologic mesh, large enough to accommodate the circumference of the bowel used for the ostomy. The mesh is placed into the subfascial plane, and tacked into place using polydioxanone (eg, PDS) suture at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o&rsquo;clock positions, to prevent displacement of the mesh during extraction of the intestine. The bowel is guided through the mesh and the aperture. The bowel can be tacked to the mesh without added morbidity, but this has not been shown to provide any added benefit and is not performed by the author. The ostomy is then matured by everting the full-thickness bowel and securing to the skin without tension as described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H245374741\"><span class=\"h4\">Onlay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onlay technique places the mesh anterior to the rectus fascia, which avoids extensive dissection, and minimizes additional operative time.

Biologic mesh is also advocated for use in contaminated fields, and for patients with inflammatory bowel disease due to the high risk of reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. </p><p>Each type of mesh is safe and associated with low rates of complications, such as infection, erosion, fistula, and stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>]. Biologic mesh is a biocompatible alternative to synthetic prosthetic mesh and has comparable tensile strength; acellular dermal matrix (ADM), which becomes vascularized and remodeled into autologous tissue after implantation, may represent the best alternative to prosthetic mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/47,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,68</a>]. </p><p>The various types of mesh that are available for surgical reconstruction, including synthetic and biologic substitutes, are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

Alternatively, if a stapled anastomosis is not feasible then a hand-sewn anastomosis may be performed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60241044\"><span class=\"h2\">Ileostomy closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a loop ileostomy is performed, it is usually closed between eight weeks and three months following the initial procedure, once the anastomosis is well healed. </p><p>Closure is performed in a similar manner to loop colostomy as described above. The stoma is freed for the abdominal wall and extracted through the trephine.

Parastomal hernia and its management are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications#H60242904\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine care of patients with an ileostomy or colostomy and management of ostomy complications&quot;, section on 'Ostomy complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parastomal-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parastomal hernia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21064833\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ostomy is a purposeful anastomosis between a segment of the gastrointestinal tract and the skin of the anterior abdominal wall. Fecal diversions are commonly classified according to the segment of the bowel used to create the ostomy (eg, sigmoid, colon, ileum) and the manner of surgical construction (eg, loop, end, reservoir). Fecal diversion by creation of an ostomy (ileostomy, colostomy) is indicated when restoration of intestinal continuity is contraindicated, or not immediately feasible given the patient&rsquo;s clinical condition. (See <a href=\"#H60234724\" class=\"local\">'Fecal diversions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative evaluation includes counseling and site selection. Prior to elective procedures, preoperative siting of the stoma by an enterostomal nurse is preferred, rather than intraoperative site selection. In the absence of an enterostomal nurse, such as with urgent or emergent surgery, particularly during off hours, preoperative stoma site selection and patient counseling by an experienced surgeon is also appropriate, but we refer the patient for counseling with an ostomy nurse specialist in the postoperative period. (See <a href=\"#H21063010\" class=\"local\">'Site selection and marking'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21062994\" class=\"local\">'Preparation and counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stoma should be located to either side of the abdominal midline, just lateral and inferior to the umbilicus. The patient must be able to see the stoma and access it without difficulty. The ostomy placement must be at least 5 cm from all folds, creases, previous incisions, belt line, umbilicus, and bony prominences for optimal appliance adherence. (See <a href=\"#H21063010\" class=\"local\">'Site selection and marking'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing construction of a defunctioning stoma (eg, relief of a bowel obstruction) as the sole indication and who have not undergone multiple prior abdominal surgeries, we suggest a laparoscopic approach, rather than an open abdominal approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H314989938\" class=\"local\">'Role of laparoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients requiring temporary loop ostomy for the sole purpose of diversion, we use a diverting loop ileostomy, rather than a diverting loop colostomy. Reversal of a loop ileostomy is easier compared with loop colostomy. However, when permanent or immediate fecal diversion is required, we use a colostomy when feasible, rather than an ileostomy, particularly in older patients. Colostomy has less risk for dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing permanent ostomy, we recommend prophylactic mesh rather than no mesh (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Placement of mesh at the time of stoma formation may reduce the risk of&nbsp;parastomal&nbsp;hernia. (See <a href=\"#H21063053\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic mesh'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parastomal-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parastomal hernia&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reversal of temporary ostomy is delayed until the underlying condition has resolved, the patient has recovered to baseline status, and inflammation has subsided with softening of adhesions, which can take up to three months. Ostomy closure can generally be performed locally by freeing the stoma circumferentially from the abdominal wall, and using a stapler to create a side-to-side functional end-to-end anastomosis. If a stapled anastomosis is not feasible, then a hand-sewn anastomosis may be performed. (See <a href=\"#H60234676\" class=\"local\">'Ostomy reversal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Cataldo PA.
