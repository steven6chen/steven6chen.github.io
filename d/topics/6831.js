The multipotent hematopoietic stem cells required for this procedure are usually obtained from the bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood of a related or unrelated donor. The hematopoietic products used for transplantation have a mixture of very primitive stem cells and more mature committed progenitor cells; these two levels of maturation of hematopoietic cells cannot be distinguished morphologically. The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of hematopoietic <span class=\"nowrap\">progenitor/stem</span> cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood <span class=\"nowrap\">stem/progenitor</span> cell transplantation). The peripheral blood hematopoietic product will be termed PBPC (peripheral blood progenitor cells) recognizing that stem cells must be present for long-term hematopoietic engraftment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to most organ transplantation, hematopoietic stem cells are a renewable resource that, with the exception of umbilical cord blood donation, requires the participation of a donor. It is critical that the donor evaluation determine both that the collection procedure is safe for the donor and the recipient. This is particularly important as advances in transplantation have resulted in an increase in allowable patient age into the seventh decade, which increases the likelihood that potential sibling donors will be older and have co-morbidities that could affect the health of either the donor or the recipient.</p><p>This topic will review the evaluation of a potential donor that has been identified as an appropriate match for a transplant recipient. The general issues involved in donor selection for allogeneic HCT and the use of umbilical cord blood for transplantation are discussed separately.

Guidelines for donor health are available on the <a href=\"http://bethematch.org/support-the-cause/donate-bone-marrow/join-the-marrow-registry/medical-guidelines/&amp;token=xOUuVNxX3vV6QdDe7l+6ts94yqU2cIwTnXlc8P+j42eEGycMKYFDBznJuqYZEKpZ4QV9Fldbg06vwHZbGN8cQT41iFZPPJBiXyMsUWOKVro0sJN4r1k/T3xz7sTLujLk&amp;TOPIC_ID=96033\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">BeTheMatch website</a>. This set of guidelines is somewhat more restrictive than standard requirements for related donor transplantation. For instance, donors older than 60 years may be acceptable for related donor transplantation but are excluded by the NMDP. At times, if the risk is considered acceptable, related donors with autoimmune diseases, diabetes related complications, and other medical issues may be used within families but are excluded for unrelated donors.</p><p>Donors are assessed for medical suitability and donor eligibility. Medical suitability pertains specifically to the donor's physical health and the possibility of transmitting an inherited or acquired condition. Donor eligibility refers specifically to an FDA required assessment for the increased risk for transmission of relevant communicable diseases. The evaluation for medical suitability and donor eligibility includes a physical examination, directed medical history, a review of available medical records, infectious disease testing, and additional testing that may be warranted by virtue of any underlying pre-existent conditions. Risk of transmission of infectious or other diseases does not necessarily disqualify a donor; however, the recipient must be informed of the potential risk. Often, the stringent prohibition of donors at risk of transmitting communicable diseases is waived if use of the donor is determined to be in the best interest of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10299535\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing for risks to the recipient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The donor evaluation process includes a<strong> </strong>physical exam and comprehensive health assessment including screening for intravenous (IV) drug use, history of blood transfusions, pregnancies, abortions, tattoos, immunizations, and travel history. A standardized questionnaire (<a href=\"http://www.aabb.org/tm/questionnaires/Pages/default.aspx&amp;token=Zhk3SsDNzGEOSDTcBVv9fZQu+jsFBbrX2yVBN+N1XiCupTUkbRX3OdeZNnHurXOaZGIob2biCut7wJjfqzkHFA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=96033\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Donor History Questionnaires [DHQ] and medications lists from the AABB website</a>) is used as a checklist to avoid missing critical information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This questionnaire was developed by an AABB task force to comply with requirements of the FDA, FACT, and the NMDP. We also perform the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count with white cell differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes are included in the screening of all donors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A standard panel of infectious disease markers includes HIV, HTLV-1 and HTLV-II, West Nile virus, hepatitis A and B serologies, as well as hepatitis B and C viral load. Chagas disease, syphilis, and CMV serology are required, mirroring the FDA requirements for normal blood donors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56453 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Donors who have antibodies to hepatitis B or C are eligible to donate. If polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing demonstrates viremia, donors may be acceptable for family member donation depending on the serology of the recipient and the ability to receive effective antiviral therapy. Viremic donors are not acceptable donors for unrelated recipients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the donor has had high-risk behavior associated with HIV, HHV8 testing should be conducted. Donors with confirmed HIV are unable to donate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology#H152753516\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Pathogenesis and epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum pregnancy testing is required for all female donors less than 55 years unless the donor is postmenopausal or is surgically infertile. Marrow donation in the second trimester is thought to be safe; however, it is limited to donation for related donors if the transplantation is considered to be urgent. Pregnant donors cannot receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=filgrastim-including-biosimilars-of-filgrastim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">filgrastim</a>, because the risk to the fetus has not been determined. Pregnant donors are disqualified from donating to unrelated recipients until after delivery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing with chest radiography, urinalysis, or electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed if there are underlying problems that may warrant evaluation, for instance a history of coronary disease, arrhythmias, or heavy smoking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin electrophoresis may be performed in potential donors who have relatives with a hemoglobinopathy (eg, thalassemia, sickle cell) or if there is suspicion that the donor is a carrier. Neither sickle cell trait nor thalassemia minor is a risk for the recipient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We inquire about travel history and residence to assess for exposure to malaria and other infections. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy is not specifically tested, but donors meeting residence requirements in Europe are still considered ineligible (although rarely disqualified). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-medical-history#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Medical history&quot;, section on 'Blood donor deferral'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or ulcerative colitis may be transmitted to the recipient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasionally, the donor may be found to have abnormal hematologic parameters that may warrant marrow examination to determine eligibility. These are not absolute contraindications to donation but must be assessed in the context of the indication for transplantation, donor availability, and risk to the recipient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10299541\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All donors must be fully informed of the risks and benefits of donation and sign appropriate consent forms indicating that they understand the risks and that they have been informed of alternative procedures. In order to avoid a conflict of interest and potential coercion, the donor evaluators are separate from the transplantation team. More subtle coercion on the part of family members is more difficult to prevent and requires a private evaluation with the donor and the provision of a safe mechanism to refuse donation. The transplant clinicians request either peripheral blood progenitor cells or bone marrow. The donor must be aware they can refuse either one or both of the procedures.</p><p>Additional information regarding informed decision making and effective communication is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=informed-procedural-consent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Informed procedural consent&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10299547\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing for risks to the donor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematopoietic <span class=\"nowrap\">stem/progenitor</span> cells can be obtained from the donor either via direct needle aspiration of the posterior iliac crests (bone marrow donation) or by mobilizing cells from the marrow into the blood where they can be collected via leukapheresis (peripheral blood progenitor cell [PBPC] donation). Approximately 5 percent of the donor's stem cells are collected. These cells have the capacity for self-renewal and replace themselves in weeks to months, leaving the donor with a full complement of hematopoietic stem cells. There is often a period of discomfort that either precedes donation, as in the case of PBPC, or follows donation if marrow is collected. In both cases, donors return to fully normal performance over the course of days to weeks after the donation.</p><p>Details regarding bone marrow harvest and PBPC mobilization are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3421300912\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychological effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychological testing has determined that donation&nbsp;is considered altruistic and desirable for most donors; however, some family member donors feel compelled to donate by pressure from relatives. They at times feel neglected since the family's energy is directed towards the patient. But both related and unrelated donors feel a satisfaction and pride in their role, although it may be tempered by guilt and a particular sense of personal responsibility complicating their grief if the recipient relapses or dies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10299553\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone marrow donation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow donation is performed under general or regional anesthesia and is therefore subject to risks associated with these forms of anesthesia. Obese donors may have an increased risk of pain, hematoma formation, venous thromboembolism, and anesthesia risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3421301174\"><span class=\"h4\">Preoperative assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative evaluation should specifically include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An assessment of the posterior iliac crests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78950 \">figure 1</a>) to determine their accessibility, especially in obese donors. Donors with a history of low back problems should have an assessment of this area to be sure the marrow collection does not exacerbate a pre-existing condition.

Any donor with a hemoglobin of &lt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> should take iron supplements (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> 325 mg orally three times a day or equivalent) for one month prior to and after marrow donation, if feasible. Autologous blood may be collected for later use, especially if a large volume is collected. This is often suggested for female donors weighing less than 70 kg. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Preoperative autologous blood donation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10299559\"><span class=\"h4\">Bone marrow collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow collection is performed in the operating room under sterile conditions. Multiple aspirates of the posterior iliac crests are performed under general or regional anesthesia using a large bore needle. Additional bone marrow can be obtained from the anterior iliac crest; however, the amounts available are relatively limited and this site is rarely used. </p><p>The volume of collection is determined by the size of the recipient and may also be influenced by the nature of subsequent processing prior to infusion. For non T cell depleted transplants, this typically amounts to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of recipient weight. For T cell depletion protocols, 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of recipient weight may be utilized. A maximum of 1500 mL is typically collected, but that is dependent on the donor's size. In some circumstances, especially if a large volume is collected, the donor will be asked to provide one unit of autologous blood for later use. &#160;</p><p>Donors are asked to refrain from heavy lifting and high impact exercises (eg, jogging, aerobic dancing) for approximately six weeks to allow the iliac crest to heal. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is avoided because of the heightened risk of bleeding. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3421301257\"><span class=\"h4\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow harvest is frequently complicated by mild to moderate back or hip pain, fatigue, and transient changes in peripheral blood cell counts. Donors typically require iron replacement and analgesia after the collection. Serious complications of bone marrow harvest are extremely rare and involve mechanical injury, complications of anesthesia, infection, and bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) has kept careful records of the volunteer donors who have undergone bone marrow collection. In the first 9245 harvests, 125 donors (1.35 percent) experienced a serious medical complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Of these, complications thought to be directly related to the procedure resulted in mechanical injury to tissue, bone, or nerve (n = 69), anesthetic complications (n = 45), infection (n = 1), and a grand mal seizure (n = 1). The median time to recovery following donation for this population that experienced a serious medical complication was 10 months, but 67 experienced prolonged recovery time.</p><p>Data regarding less serious, but common, symptoms associated with donation were collected by the NMDP regarding 2505 harvests with the following results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain was the most common acute symptom. On day 2 after donation, patients reported back <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hip pain (82 percent), throat pain (33 percent), or headache (17 percent). The pain was mild (grade 1) in the majority and resolved in over 80 percent by one month, and by one year the percent of patients with pain (&lt;10 percent) was similar to that seen prior to the procedure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue was the second most common symptom. On day 2, mild to moderate fatigue was reported in 59 percent of donors but resolved by one month in the majority (95 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other less common side effects were site reaction, insomnia, nausea, dizziness, and anorexia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately after donation, most donors experienced an approximately 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> decrease in hemoglobin. Hemoglobin remained slightly decreased at one month post-donation, but returned to baseline by one year. In addition, there was an immediate slight increase in white blood cell count (median 9.7 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L,</span> interquartile range 7.6 to 12.7) and decrease in platelet count (median 214 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L,</span> interquartile range 179 to 252) that returned to baseline by one month post-donation. For donors where there is adequate time, collection of one to two autologous red blood cell units can be accomplished. Other blood products, including red blood cell infusions, are rarely required and should be avoided unless absolutely indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median time to full recovery was approximately three weeks. Full recovery was reported by approximately 70 and 95 percent by one and three months after donation, respectively.</p><p/><p>Studies of pediatric donors have also demonstrated that bone marrow harvest is safe in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. As an example, the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Pediatrics Diseases Working Party reported no serious complications among 313 pediatric bone marrow donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, the risk of requiring an allogeneic transfusion following bone marrow harvest was highest among patients less than four years old and those requiring a bone marrow harvest volume &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span>. Such donors should be considered for autologous blood donation prior to bone marrow harvest, and harvest volumes should not exceed 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span>. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10299571\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3421301404\"><span class=\"h4\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progenitors and stem cells normally circulate in small numbers that are insufficient to collect for clinical use. Sufficient numbers of cells can usually be collected after the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=filgrastim-including-biosimilars-of-filgrastim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">filgrastim</a>) over four to six consecutive days. The leukapheresis procedure typically processes two to four blood volumes and takes three to six hours, depending on the donor size, donor <span class=\"nowrap\">progenitor/stem</span> cell count, and how many stem cells are needed for the recipient. Approximately two-thirds of donors provide adequate <span class=\"nowrap\">progenitor/stem</span> cells in a single session. The remainder requires a second session or, rarely, two more sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Potential risks for the donor include those related to the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=filgrastim-including-biosimilars-of-filgrastim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">filgrastim</a> (G-CSF) and to apheresis. Adequate venous access is required and, while most apheresis collections can be performed through peripheral access, occasional donors with small veins will require a temporary central venous catheter. Central line complications include pain on insertion, pneumothorax, hemorrhage, or infection. Management of donors with coronary artery disease, hypertension, or diabetes requires special attention on the part of the apheresis staff, since the changes in blood volume and administration of glucose containing fluids can result in angina, hypotension, and hyperglycemia in susceptible donors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications#H547717\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Complications&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for suspected complications'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=filgrastim-including-biosimilars-of-filgrastim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Filgrastim</a> is associated with mild to moderate generalized musculoskeletal pain in the vast majority of donors and with flu-like symptoms in a minority. Since the filgrastim is administered for five to six days, some donors may require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or narcotic analgesics for several days prior to donation. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is avoided because of the heightened risk of bleeding during the procedure and due to the thrombocytopenia, which may follow PBPC donation. </p><p>Donors may be thrombocytopenic for days or weeks after leukapheresis, but this is generally not clinically significant. The total white blood cell (WBC) count rises substantially during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=filgrastim-including-biosimilars-of-filgrastim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">filgrastim</a> administration, often achieving levels of 50 to 80 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L,</span> but elevation of the WBC count in and of itself does not entail any direct risk. However, some donor centers limit the use of filgrastim to keep the total WBC within local guidelines.</p><p>The following studies have evaluated the toxicity of PBPC donation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of first-time unrelated donors from 2004 to 2009 by the NMDP, 6768 of 9494 (71 percent) donations were PBPCs collected over one (73 percent) or two days of apheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Central venous access was required for 21 percent of women and 5 percent of men; however, in our experience, this rate of central venous catheter insertion is high and can be avoided by well trained personnel. Less than 3 percent of donors were hospitalized. The following complications were noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The majority of donors experienced mild to moderate (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2)</span> generalized musculoskeletal pain within 24 hours of G-CSF administration. This pain peaked around day 5 and usually returned to baseline within one week. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most common apheresis-related toxicity was numbness or tingling that was transient (33 to 45 percent), persistent moderate (2 to 8 percent), or severe (&lt;1 percent). Tetany occurred in &lt;1 percent. Other toxicities included nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting (&lt;2 percent) and mild to moderate local intravenous site infections (&lt;1 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Changes in peripheral blood counts were common.

However, they may be asked to donate for a relative, most often a sibling. The use of cells collected from a minor sibling is associated with fewer transplant-related complications and greater overall survival for the recipient compared with the use of cells obtained from adult unrelated donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A survey of pediatric transplant clinicians demonstrated that the majority feels that it is acceptable to expose minor siblings to the risks of donation when it offers the family member the potential of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>In 2010, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a policy statement on the use of children as donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The expected risks to minor bone marrow donors are similar to those experienced by adult donors. (See <a href=\"#H3421301257\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p>A study of 313 minor bone marrow donors identified pain requiring the use of medication as the most common complication of donation occurring in 50 percent of donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Older age was the only factor associated with greater risk of pain. Children aged four to eight years had a 3.3 times greater risk of pain compared with those less than four years, and those aged greater than eight years had a fivefold higher risk. The most frequent complications of anesthesia were vomiting (12 percent), sore throat (7 percent), hypotension (6 percent), tachycardia (4 percent), and bradycardia (0.6 percent). In a multivariate logistic regression model, only <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/recipient</span> weight ratio &lt;0.75 was associated with increased risk of cardiac complications, presumably due to the volume of marrow collected relative to donor size. <span class=\"nowrap\">Donor/recipient</span> weight ratio &lt;0.75 was also associated with greater risk of post-donation anemia. </p><p>Peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) donation presents unique challenges to minor donors. The expected complications of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in children are similar to those experienced by adult donors, though pain is less frequently reported by minor donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/10,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,26</a>]. Central venous access is required by most donors younger than 12 years of age, and the donor is placed under conscious sedation or general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Serious complications of central line placement in donors appear to be uncommon, occurring in less than 2 percent of donors in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/10,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,24</a>]. Younger, smaller donors are at greater risk for exposure to blood products due to the need to prime the apheresis circuit with blood products in children who weigh less than 20 kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The larger the weight discrepancy between the donor and recipient, the greater the expected number of days of collection. More than half of the children required greater than one day of collection in a European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) study of 140 minor PBPC donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10299577\" class=\"local\">'Toxicity of PBPC donation'</a> above.)</p><p>There is no direct medical benefit to minor donors. The potential benefits are all expected to be psychosocial. There are few studies of the psychosocial effects of donation on minor donors. The literature suggests that a broad range of response to donation exists and they are impacted by many clinical, family, and psychosocial variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. There is evidence to support that both donor and non-donor siblings experience stress related to their sibling's transplant. </p><p>A prospective longitudinal study of the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of pediatric sibling donors found that approximately 20 percent of children who served as a stem cell donor for their sibling reported poor HRQoL at each of the time points assessed (pre-donation, four weeks following, and one year after donation); this was more prominent in the younger donors and differed from the parental report of the donor&rsquo;s HRQoL (which was likely to be higher) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The study could not determine causality and other factors (eg, having a sick sibling) may have contributed to the reported HRQoL measures. The literature does not consistently indicate more adverse or positive impacts in minor donor siblings than non-donor siblings.

If the recipient is undergoing transplantation for an inherited condition, then the potential donor must be adequately screened for the same disease or genetic carrier status in certain conditions. There are no widely accepted guidelines for choosing a donor among equally HLA-compatible siblings who are unaffected by the recipient's underlying disease. The AAP recommends selecting the potential donor who is closest to the age of consent and avoiding donors who are developmentally unable to provide assent, when possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

It does not require the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=filgrastim-including-biosimilars-of-filgrastim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">filgrastim</a>, so it is generally easier than PBPC donation.

Graft rejection can occur early, with no evidence of hematologic recovery in the first month after transplantation, or it can occur months later. There is also an entity referred to as graft insufficiency or graft exhaustion in which it appears that too few stem cells were administered with the initial transplantation. Depending on the timing, clinical circumstances, and the purported etiology of the graft failure, the transplant team may request either marrow or PBPC for a second procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10299658\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Providing immunologically competent cells to a patient who cannot clear an opportunistic infection may be life-saving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Moreover, there are data that leukemic relapse can be treated with genetically engineered T cells to re-establish remission (eg, chimeric antigen receptor T cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The donor can refuse either one or both of the procedures. With either procedure, approximately 5 percent of the donor's stem cells are collected. These cells will replace themselves in weeks to months, leaving the donor with a full complement of hematopoietic stem cells. There is often a period of discomfort that either precedes donation, as in the case of PBPC, or follows donation if marrow is collected. In both cases, donors return to fully normal performance over the course of days to weeks after the donation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow or PBPC donors should avoid potential bone marrow suppressive agents, such as alcohol or anti-platelet drugs, for at least 14 days before donation and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> sodium for 24 hours prior to donation.

Following collection, donors typically experience mild to moderate back or hip pain, fatigue, and transient changes in peripheral blood cell counts. Donors are asked to refrain from heavy lifting and high impact exercises for approximately six weeks to allow the iliac crest to heal. Donors often require iron replacement and analgesia after the collection. Serious complications of bone marrow harvest are extremely rare.

Some donors may require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or narcotic analgesics for several days prior to donation to control the generalized musculoskeletal pain associated with filgrastim.
