Both are associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), have similar clinical manifestations and features on renal histology (eg, a focal necrotizing, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis), and have similar therapies. There are, however, several differences between these disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H11698538\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Therapy of GPA and MPA has two components: induction of remission with initial immunosuppressive therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive therapy for a variable period to prevent relapse.</p><p>Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy of GPA and MPA will be reviewed here. Initial immunosuppressive therapy, the treatment of resistant or relapsing disease, clinical manifestations and diagnosis, and prognosis are discussed elsewhere.

Some may not require maintenance therapy, including those with drug-induced vasculitis and some who are myeloperoxidase (MPO)-antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) positive and have a clinical remission after induction therapy for their initial presentation with vasculitis. (See <a href=\"#H627224328\" class=\"local\">'Patients with drug-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H627221697\" class=\"local\">'MPO-ANCA-positive patients'</a> below.)</p><p>The goal of maintenance therapy is to prevent relapse. Relapse is defined as the recurrence of signs or symptoms of active vasculitis in any organ system after remission is achieved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-management-of-relapsing-disease-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and management of relapsing disease in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Definition of relapsing disease'</a>.)</p><p>Monitoring patients who are receiving maintenance therapy for the development of relapse includes patient self-monitoring as well as frequent monitoring by the clinician. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-management-of-relapsing-disease-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H2974873224\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and management of relapsing disease in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Monitoring for relapse'</a>.)</p><p>If maintenance therapy fails and a relapse is diagnosed, patients should repeat induction immunosuppressive therapy, have an intensification of their maintenance therapy, or have a change in the mode of maintenance therapy, depending upon the severity of the relapse. The diagnosis and treatment of relapsing disease are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-management-of-relapsing-disease-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and management of relapsing disease in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of relapsing disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-management-of-relapsing-disease-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and management of relapsing disease in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Treatment of relapsing disease'</a>.)</p><p>Disease activity can be assessed by use of one of several versions of the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS), which has been applied to both patients with GPA and patients with MPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While this scale is rarely used in clinical practice, complete remission is defined as a BVAS of 0, which means that there is no clinical, radiologic, or pathologic evidence of active disease within the preceding 28 days (although a BVAS of 0 does not indicate that relapse will not occur) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. If the BVAS is not used, it is important to establish that the initial signs and symptoms of disease have resolved and no new features of disease have occurred. As examples, patients who presented with pulmonary disease should have chest imaging to establish that active disease has abated, and patients who presented with ear, nose, and throat disease should undergo an otolaryngologic examination to establish remission.</p><p>Complete remission does <strong>not</strong> mean that all parameters have returned to baseline, because persistent abnormalities may reflect irreversible injury induced during the period of active inflammation. As an example, a patient in whom the systemic symptoms and signs resolve and the urine sediment becomes inactive is considered to be in remission, even if there is persistent proteinuria or persistent or even slowly worsening renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial immunosuppressive therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Definition of complete remission'</a>.)</p><p>Relapse, which may be identified by the clinician as a BVAS &gt;0 in a patient formerly in complete remission, can start (eg, with fever, rash, other signs) days or weeks before it is diagnosed. Patient assessments of their own disease activity (ie, self-monitoring) can identify a relapse sooner than the clinician can [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

However, even if glucocorticoid therapy can reduce the risk of relapse, it is not clear that such prolonged treatment is worth the potential toxicity. A variety of tapering regimens can be used; some contributors to this topic prefer tapering with alternate-day rather than daily prednisone therapy, whereas other contributors use a daily regimen. As with several other chronic, relapsing autoimmune inflammatory disorders, some patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis benefit from continuing low-dose prednisone to prevent mild symptoms (eg, arthralgias or rhinitis).</p><p>The goal is to discontinue glucocorticoids after four to eight months in order to lower the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,9</a>]. Thus, by the time patients begin maintenance therapy, they are usually receiving low-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (or its equivalent). Tapering of glucocorticoids is continued during the maintenance phase, and tapering should continue as long as patients remain asymptomatic. The rate at which glucocorticoids can be tapered varies among patients. In patients who have had multiple relapses, some experts recommend long-term, low-dose glucocorticoid therapy.

Both are associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), have similar clinical manifestations and features on renal histology (eg, a focal necrotizing, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis), and have similar therapies. Therapy of GPA and MPA has two components: induction of remission with initial immunosuppressive therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, most often with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> for a variable period to prevent relapse. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Goal of maintenance therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of glucocorticoids plus either oral or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> induces remission in the majority of patients, usually within three to six months after the initiation of therapy. If cyclophosphamide is used for induction, maintenance therapy begins after cyclophosphamide is discontinued and when the white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count have risen to safe levels. If rituximab is used for induction therapy and patients achieve remission, maintenance typically begins between months 4 and 6, regardless of the maintenance agent that is used. (See <a href=\"#H627221457\" class=\"local\">'When to start maintenance therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients may not require maintenance therapy. As an example, patients who develop dialysis-dependent renal failure and show no evidence of return of renal function despite immunosuppressive drug therapy for more than four months are unlikely to have renal recovery. Thus, unless indicated for extrarenal manifestations, immunosuppression (including maintenance immunosuppression) should be avoided in such patients to minimize morbidity and mortality. In addition, patients with drug-induced, ANCA-associated vasculitis do not typically require maintenance therapy; relapse should not occur if the responsible drug is discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H627221684\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly used drugs for maintenance therapy in patients with GPA or MPA are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. The preference for one of these agents over the others depends in part upon whether or not the patient has newly diagnosed disease or has had one or more relapses. Other factors that could influence the choice of agent include a prior history of toxicity from a certain drug and a comorbid condition that increases the risk of toxicity with a specific agent.

Such patients have a higher risk of subsequent relapse than patients with newly diagnosed disease, and maintenance therapy is required after remission is reinduced. The choice of agent for maintenance therapy in these patients is influenced by whether or not the relapse occurred during the prior course of maintenance therapy or after the prior course of maintenance therapy was completed.

In patients who relapse <strong>during maintenance therapy</strong> with rituximab, we suggest switching to an alternative drug (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), such as azathioprine, methotrexate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil or, in select cases, a combination of these agents, rather than repeating maintenance therapy with rituximab.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients who successfully sustained their remission during maintenance therapy but then <strong>relapsed after maintenance therapy was discontinued</strong>, we suggest that, after remission is reinduced, the same drug be used for maintenance therapy that was previously used (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
