The term refers to two different syndromes, each representing a different stage of the disease. Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is an acute syndrome requiring emergent treatment to prevent death and neurologic morbidity. Korsakoff syndrome (KS) refers to a chronic neurologic condition that usually occurs as a consequence of WE.</p><p>In 1881, Carl Wernicke described an acute encephalopathy characterized by mental confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and gait ataxia and associated it with autopsy findings of punctate hemorrhages around the third and fourth ventricles and the aqueduct. A few years later, Russian psychiatrist Sergei Korsakoff described a chronic amnestic syndrome in which memory was impaired far out of proportion to other cognitive domains. While both observations were described in the context of chronic alcoholism, neither Wernicke nor Korsakoff initially recognized the relationship between the disorders, which was not appreciated until later by other investigators.</p><p>This topic will review Wernicke encephalopathy. Korsakoff syndrome and other chronic neurologic complications of alcohol abuse, including alcohol withdrawal are discussed separately.

The prevalence of WE lesions seen on autopsy was 12.5 percent of alcohol abusers in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among those with alcohol-related deaths, it has been reported to be even higher, 29 to 59 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Autopsy studies have consistently revealed a higher incidence of Wernicke lesions in the general population than is predicted by clinical studies, suggesting that it is under-recognized clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p>While cases of WE in men outnumber those in women, women appear to be more susceptible to developing WE than men. In several series, the female to male ratio for WE was higher than the ratio for alcohol dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While most often associated with chronic alcoholism, WE occurs also in the setting of poor nutrition caused by malabsorption, poor dietary intake, increased metabolic requirement (eg, during systemic illnesses), or increased loss of the water-soluble vitamin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> (eg, in renal dialysis). In one autopsy series, non-alcohol abusers accounted for 12 of 52 cases (23 percent) of WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Thiamine requirements depend on metabolic rate, with the greatest need during periods of high metabolic demand and high glucose intake. This is manifest by the precipitation of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) in susceptible patients by administration of intravenous glucose before thiamine supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Evidence for the role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> in WE is supported by observations that the thiamine antagonist pyrithiamine causes experimental thiamine deficiency in rats, resulting in a sequence of ataxia, loss of the righting reflex, and convulsions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. In some cases, low levels of magnesium, an essential cofactor of thiamine into its active diphosphate and triphosphate forms, have been implicated with thiamine deficiency in WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Because of the role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> in cerebral energy utilization, it has been proposed that its deficiency initiates neuronal injury by inhibiting metabolism in brain regions with high metabolic requirements and high thiamine turnover. Events such as blood-brain barrier breakdown, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity, and increased reactive oxygen species have been implicated in thiamine deficiency-induced neurotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Thiamine</a> deficiency in alcohol abusers results from a combination of inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption, decreased hepatic storage, and impaired utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Only a subset of thiamine-deficient alcohol abusers develop WE. Greater susceptibility among identical rather than fraternal twins suggests a genetic predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Investigators have found that in alcohol abusers with WE, the thiamine-dependent enzyme transketolase has an altered affinity for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/38-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-46</a>]. Variants in the high affinity thiamine transporter gene have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute WE lesions are characterized by vascular congestion, microglial proliferation, and petechial hemorrhages. In chronic cases, there is demyelination, gliosis, and loss of neuropil with relative preservation of neurons. Neuronal loss is most prominent in the relatively unmyelinated medial thalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,49</a>]. Atrophy of the mamillary bodies is a highly specific finding in chronic WE and Korsakoff syndrome and is present in up to 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,50</a>].</p><p>The lesions of WE occur in a characteristic, symmetrical distribution in structures surrounding the third ventricle, aqueduct, and fourth ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,50</a>]. The mamillary bodies are involved in virtually all cases, and the dorsomedial thalamus, locus ceruleus, periaqueductal gray, ocular motor nuclei, and vestibular nuclei are commonly affected. Lesions occur less frequently in the colliculi, fornices, septal region, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex, which may show patchy, diffuse neuronal loss and astrocytic proliferation.</p><p>In about one-half of cases, sagittal sections through the cerebellum reveal selective loss of Purkinje cells at the tips of the folia of the anterior superior cerebellar vermis. The latter changes are identical to those found in alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, where they can occur in the absence of other Wernicke lesions.

However, this may be the exception rather than the rule. Detailed clinical and neuropathological data from 82 autopsies and 245 patients examined over 10 years revealed that all features of the triad were recognized in only one-third of patients; in most, only one or two elements of the clinical triad were apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Confusion was the most common presenting symptom, followed by staggering gait and ocular problems. A similar constellation of symptoms has been reported in smaller series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/4,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,51</a>].</p><p>Absence of one or more of the classic symptoms likely leads to under-diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/4,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,52</a>]. In one series, WE was diagnosed premortem in only 26 of 131 patients whose brains revealed chronic WE lesions. All signs of the classic triad were recorded in 17 percent; none were recorded in 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Clinical records documented a high incidence of mental status abnormalities (82 percent), but much lower incidences of ataxia (23 percent), ocular motor abnormalities (29 percent), and polyneuropathy (11 percent).</p><p>The symptoms may present more or less simultaneously. Often, however, ataxia precedes other symptoms by a few days or weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Encephalopathy</strong> &mdash; The encephalopathy is characterized by profound disorientation, indifference, and inattentiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If these are less severe and permit higher cognitive testing, impaired memory and learning are also evident. Some patients exhibit an agitated delirium related to concomitant ethanol withdrawal. Fewer than 5 percent present with a depressed level of consciousness, although the course in untreated patients will progress through stupor and coma to death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,53</a>]. In one autopsy series, patients with unrecognized WE frequently had lethargy or coma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oculomotor dysfunction</strong> &mdash; Nystagmus, lateral rectus palsy, and conjugate gaze palsies reflect lesions of the oculomotor, abducens, and vestibular nuclei. Ocular abnormalities usually occur in combination rather than alone.<br/><br/>Nystagmus is the most common finding and is typically evoked by horizontal gaze to both sides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Vertical nystagmus can also occur, usually evoked by upward, rather than downward, gaze. Rotatory and vertical nystagmus alone are uncommon. Lateral rectus palsy is virtually always bilateral. Vertical gaze palsies are less common than conjugate gaze palsies, and isolated vertical gaze palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and complete ophthalmoplegia are rare. Pupillary abnormalities, usually sluggish or unequal pupils, may be present. A light-near dissociation is sometimes seen. In advanced cases, there may be complete loss of eye movements with miotic, nonreactive pupils. Ptosis is uncommon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gait ataxia</strong> &mdash; Ataxia primarily involves stance and gait and is likely due to a combination of polyneuropathy, cerebellar involvement, and vestibular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,54</a>]. When severe, walking is impossible. Less affected patients walk with a wide-based gait and slow, short-spaced steps. Gait abnormalities are appreciated only on tandem gait in some patients.<br/><br/>Cerebellar pathology is generally restricted to the anterior and superior vermis; thus, ataxia of the legs or arms and dysarthria or scanning speech are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Vestibular dysfunction may be the major cause of acute gait ataxia in WE, also explaining the dissociation between gait and limb abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,54,55</a>]. These findings contrast with those reported in patients with alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, in whom lower extremity ataxia is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-chronic-neurologic-complications-of-alcohol#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the chronic neurologic complications of alcohol&quot;, section on 'Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the classic triad, stupor or coma, hypotension, and hypothermia were prominent findings in unsuspected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Patients with WE may also present with the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of protein-calorie malnutrition is observed frequently in patients with WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, not all patients are malnourished; in Australia, some beer drinkers with WE were even reported to be overweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vestibular dysfunction without hearing loss is a common finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1,54,55,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,54,55,58</a>]. In one study of 17 patients with acute WE, cold caloric responses were absent on at least one side in all, and abnormalities were bilateral in 11 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The presence of spontaneous nystagmus with absent caloric responses appears to be a relatively specific finding in WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Vertigo is unusual. Some vestibular dysfunction is permanent after WE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral neuropathy is common and typically involves just the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients complain of the gradual onset of weakness, paresthesias, and pain affecting the distal lower extremities. In many patients there are no symptoms of neuropathy, but examination reveals diminished or absent ankle jerks and patchy distal sensory loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothermia has been described in 1 to 4 percent of patients with WE who went to autopsy, and it has been noted in numerous case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1,52,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,52,59</a>]. Hypothermia may cause unreactive pupils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], a finding rarely encountered in normothermic patients with WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Lesions in the posterior and posterolateral hypothalamus were noted in two patients with WE and hypothermia in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. This location is consistent with the known thermoregulatory functions of the hypothalamus. Other signs of autonomic involvement may include hypotension and syncope. In one autopsy series, hypotension and hypothermia were prevalent in unsuspected cases of WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While overt beriberi heart disease is rare in WE, other cardiovascular signs and symptoms are common and include tachycardia, exertional dyspnea, elevated cardiac output, and EKG abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These reverse with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> administration.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although laboratory studies and neuroimaging studies can be helpful, Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is primarily a clinical diagnosis. The main barrier to diagnosis is a low index of suspicion in the nonalcoholic patient, especially when the classic triad of clinical symptoms is not present and the patient is not a known alcoholic. Institution of early <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> replacement takes priority, and response to treatment may be diagnostic. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>WE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients presenting with acute delirium or acute ataxia. It follows that other causes of delirium are considered in the diagnosis of a patient presenting with WE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59893 \">table 1</a>). In one case series of 36 hospitalized geriatric patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> deficiency was common and associated with delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In another small series, thiamine deficiency appeared to contribute to postoperative confusion in older patients after hip surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. These results appear to be contradicted by a larger series of 118 older inpatients in which there was no association between thiamine deficiency and delirium; however, the inclusion of patients with dementia and a broader definition of delirium in this study may have influenced these results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The evaluation of patients with delirium are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Also, structural diseases in the medial thalami, hippocampi or inferior medial temporal lobes should be considered because of the neuroanatomic overlap with WE. These include top-of-the-basilar stroke, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest, herpes simplex encephalitis, and third ventricular tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While autopsy studies likely underestimate the presence of classic signs that were not properly elicited, recognized, or recorded, it is clear that the diagnosis of WE can be missed when reliance is placed on the presence of all three of the typical symptoms. Autopsy-based series suggest that many patients lack one or more elements of this triad, and in some, lethargy or coma is the only clinical feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1,4,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,52</a>]. </p><p>Suggested criteria for the diagnosis of WE and KS in chronic alcohol abusers is based upon clinical-neuropathological correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/3,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,67</a>]. WE is diagnosed in patients with two of the following four Caine criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oculomotor abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Either altered mental status or mild memory impairment</p><p/><p>In one study of 106 autopsied alcohol abusers, the Caine criteria increased the diagnostic sensitivity for WE from 22 percent using the classic triad, to 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The Caine criteria are clearly more sensitive than the classic triad, but given the high morbidity and mortality associated with the disorder, they are not sensitive enough. Specificity is low, and these criteria were not intended to apply to nonalcoholics in whom the diagnosis is further impeded by a lower index of suspicion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no laboratory studies that are diagnostic of WE. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Thiamine</a> deficiency can be most reliably detected by measurement of erythrocyte thiamine transketolase (ETKA) before and after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). A low ETKA, along with a more than 25 percent stimulation, establishes the diagnosis of thiamine deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. This test is often not readily available, especially in the emergency setting. A serum thiamine or thiamine pyrophosphate level in serum or whole blood can also be measured by high-performance liquid chromatography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].

When the diagnosis of Wernicke encephalopathy is entertained, immediate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> replacement takes precedence over laboratory diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with WE will likely also be tested for other toxic and metabolic conditions that can lead to delirium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a>.) In the setting of fever, or other suspicion for central nervous system infection, a lumbar puncture is required. In WE, the cerebrospinal fluid may be normal or may show a mild protein elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pleocytosis or protein &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> suggest alternative diagnoses. An EEG may be ordered if nonconvulsive seizures are suspected. In WE, only about half of patients will demonstrate EEG abnormalities, usually diffuse mild to moderate slow wave activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies are not necessary in all patients with suspected WE and should not delay treatment. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.) However, diagnostic imaging can be helpful by providing evidence of WE in many patients and may rule out alternative diagnoses.</p><p>Abnormalities on computerized tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been reported in patients with acute WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. CT may show symmetric, low density abnormalities in the diencephalon, midbrain, and periventricular regions that enhance after the injection of contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/73-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-76</a>]. Gross hemorrhages are uncommon in acute WE, but they have also been detected by CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. These findings are uncommon in other disorders, and when present, should strongly suggest the diagnosis. However, CT is an insensitive test for WE.</p><p>MRI is more sensitive than CT in detecting acute diencephalic and periventricular lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/51,78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,78,79</a>]. Typical findings include areas of increased T2 and FLAIR signals, decreased T1 signal, and diffusion abnormality surrounding the aqueduct and third ventricle and within the medial thalamus, dorsal medulla, tectal plate, and mamillary bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82317\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82317 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62065\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62065 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/79-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-86</a>]. Lesions may also be seen atypical areas such as the cerebellum, cranial nerve nuclei, dentate nuclei, caudate, red nuclei, splenium and cerebral cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>In one report comparing 15 patients with acute WE to 15 asymptomatic alcohol abusers and 15 controls, the sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 53 and 93 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Other series have reported a higher prevalence of MRI abnormalities in patients with acute WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/79,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,88</a>]. Abnormal T2 signal disappears within as little as 48 hours after treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>], and isolated mamillary body abnormality may rarely be the only finding on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>Mamillary body atrophy is a relatively specific abnormality in patients with chronic lesions of WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. A large decrease in the volume of the mamillary bodies can be identified by MRI in approximately 80 percent of alcohol abusers with a history of classic WE, and it is not found in controls, patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), or alcohol abusers without a history of WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-92</a>]. Mamillary body atrophy can be detected within one week of the onset of WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of WE is difficult to confirm and, untreated, most patients progress to coma and death. Therefore, diagnostic testing should not delay treatment, which should immediately follow consideration of the diagnosis. Fortunately, intravenous administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> is safe, simple, inexpensive, and effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/3,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,93</a>]. Adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm are reported but are extremely rare; in the United Kingdom, there were four reported cases for every five million intramuscular doses used and one report for every one million intravenous doses used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/94-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-97</a>].</p><p>Patients with suspected Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) require immediate parenteral administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a>. A recommended regimen is 500 mg of thiamine intravenously, infused over 30 minutes, three times daily for two consecutive days and 250 mg intravenously or intramuscularly once daily for an additional five days, in combination with other B vitamins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Administration of glucose without thiamine can precipitate or worsen WE; thus, thiamine should be administered before glucose. Because gastrointestinal absorption of thiamine is erratic in alcoholic and malnourished patients, oral administration of thiamine is an unreliable initial treatment for WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. High-dose parenteral thiamine therapy is justified based on the failure of lower doses to produce clinical improvement in some patients with WE; however, there are no randomized studies to support a particular dosing regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/94,95,97-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95,97-99</a>].</p><p>Although dietary requirements for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> are only 1 to 2 mg daily, absorption and utilization of thiamine are incomplete, and some patients have genetically determined requirements for much larger doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/39,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,100</a>]. Daily oral administration of 100 mg of thiamine should be continued after the completion of parenteral treatment and after discharge from the hospital until patients are no longer considered at risk. Magnesium and other vitamins are replaced as well, along with other nutritional deficits if present.</p><p>By establishing a sufficiently low threshold for treatment, all patients with WE will receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a>, including those whose diagnosis is unsuspected. For practical purposes, all at-risk patients with undiagnosed altered mental status, oculomotor disorders, or ataxia should receive parenteral thiamine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL COURSE AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prompt administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> leads to improvement in ocular signs within hours to days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If ocular palsies fail to respond, other diagnoses should be considered. In one report, recovery of vestibular function began during the second week after thiamine treatment; improvement in gait ataxia coincided with recovery of vestibular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Confusion subsides over days and weeks. Signal abnormality on MRI resolves with clinical improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/88,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,101</a>]. This early therapeutic response likely represents the recovery from a biochemical rather than a structural lesion.</p><p>In the largest cohort of patients reported on, residual deficits were the rule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While gaze palsies recovered completely in most cases, 60 percent had permanent horizontal nystagmus. Only about 40 percent recovered from ataxia; remaining deficits ranged from inability to walk at all to a wide-based slow shuffling gait. As the acute encephalopathy and confusion receded, deficits in learning and memory become more obvious; the latter recovered completely or substantively in only about 20 percent; the remainder had a permanent amnestic syndrome.

To avoid this complication, it has become standard practice in emergency departments to administer thiamine prior to or along with glucose infusion, particularly in those who are at risk for thiamine deficiency (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>Patients at risk for WE should also receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> supplementation in the absence of glucose loading. (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above). The dose, frequency, route of administration is based on standard clinical practise, as there is little controlled evidence on which to base recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. As an example, patients admitted for alcohol withdrawal should receive thiamine 100 to 250 mg daily, depending on their nutritional status and perceived risk of WE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prevention of WE and Korsakoff amnestic syndrome (KS) might be possible through the widespread oral administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> to outpatients at risk. Enrichment of flour with thiamine decreased the autopsy prevalence of WE in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. There is also interest in whether preventing thiamine deficiency would also reduce the high prevalence of cognitive deficits in alcohol abusers without known episodes of WE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wernicke-encephalopathy/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. The low cost and safety of oral thiamine argues for widespread supplementation in alcohol abusers and others at risk for developing thiamine deficiency.
