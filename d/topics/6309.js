In addition to dementia, distinctive clinical features include: visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, cognitive fluctuations, dysautonomia, sleep disorders, and neuroleptic sensitivity.</p><p>First described in the 1960s, DLB has a varied clinical presentation that shares features with other degenerative dementias. It was often overlooked pathologically because of the difficulty in identifying cortical Lewy bodies with routine cellular stains. With the advent of immunohistochemical stains for constituents of Lewy bodies, the prevalence of this disorder began to be recognized. However, challenges remain in defining this as an entity distinct from other degenerative dementias.</p><p>DLB may represent several diseases with the shared common finding of cortical Lewy bodies, or it may be a single disease with a spectrum of additional pathological features. This is reflected by the varied names by which it has been called, including diffuse Lewy body disease, Lewy body dementia, Lewy body variant of Alzheimer disease, cortical Lewy body disease, and senile dementia of the Lewy body type.</p><p>This topic will describe the epidemiology, neuropathologic findings, and potential pathogenic mechanisms of dementia with Lewy bodies. The clinical features, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In population-based and clinic-based studies, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) accounts for approximately 4 to 30 percent of dementia cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. DLB was likely underrepresented in many of these studies, however, most of which were not specifically designed to identify the prevalence of DLB and did not mention the methods of the evaluation of signs and symptoms, such as extrapyramidal signs or fluctuations in cognition, that would have increased the likelihood of diagnosing DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Autopsy series have also found DLB to represent a greater percentage of dementia cases than is typically reported in clinical series, with DLB comprising as much as 31 percent of cases in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Like Alzheimer disease (AD), DLB becomes more prevalent with age, generally affecting individuals in their sixth decade or older; the mean age at presentation is 75 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Other risk factors for DLB are not well studied but appear to overlap with many of the known risk factors for AD and Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Like Parkinson disease (PD) but in contrast to AD, DLB is more common in men, with a male to female ratio as high as 4:1 in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Other shared risk factors with PD may include a family history of PD, lack of caffeine use, higher educational attainment, and a history of anxiety or depression, although the latter may be a preclinical symptom of disease rather than a true risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Shared risk factors with AD reported in the same study included history of stroke and early oophorectomy. There are conflicting reports on the association between a family history of dementia and DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. Similar to both AD and PD, DLB risk has been inversely associated with cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In particular, mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene are more frequent in patients with DLB compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. The reported frequency of GBA mutations ranges from 4 to 28 percent in cohorts of patients with DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]; mutations have been identified in up to one-third of patients with DLB of Ashkenazi descent, a population with a high carrier rate of GBA mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In a multicenter study that included over 800 patients with either DLB or Parkinson disease (PD) with dementia and over 950 controls, GBA mutation carrier status was associated significantly with both DLB (OR = 8.28) and PD with dementia (OR = 6.48) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The presence of a GBA mutation in patients with DLB was associated with earlier disease onset (64 versus 69 years; p &lt;0.001) but similar median survival from the time of diagnosis (10.5 versus 9.2 years). A more severe motor and cognitive phenotype has also been confirmed in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A few other genes have been implicated in sporadic DLB, some of which also relate in some way to lysosomal function:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A postmortem study of familial AD due to presenilin mutations, found that Lewy bodies were more prevalent in those with presenilin-1 mutations <span class=\"nowrap\">(24/25</span> subjects) compared with those with presenilin-2 mutations <span class=\"nowrap\">(9/14</span> subjects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial sequencing studies in 89 DLB patients did not detect any pathogenic substitutions in the encoding regions for &alpha;-, &beta;-, or &gamma;-synuclein. However, in a case control study of 172 patients, several single polymorphisms were detected, one in the region for &gamma;-synuclein, that were associated significantly with DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A larger case control study found an association with the &alpha;-synuclein (SNCA) locus, as well as with a lysosomal membrane protein gene, SCARB2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar to AD, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) &epsilon;4 allele has been associated with increased risk of DLB and the APOE &epsilon;2 allele with decreased risk of DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/9,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,27</a>]. In a cohort that included 667 pathologically-confirmed DLB cases and 2624 controls, APOE was confirmed as a strong risk factor for DLB (odds ratio 2.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In the pigmented neurons of the substantia nigra, Lewy bodies are easy to visualize on microscopic examination using the hematoxylin and eosin stain as pink inclusions surrounded by white halos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Immunohistochemical stains for ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein facilitate the identification of Lewy bodies outside of the substantia nigra.</p><p>In dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), cortical Lewy bodies are found in the deep cortical layers throughout the brain, especially in the anterior frontal and temporal lobes, the cingulate gyrus, and the insula. As in Parkinson disease, Lewy bodies in DLB can also be seen in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus, as well as the raphe nuclei, nucleus basalis of Meynert, and other brainstem nuclei. The pathology of DLB and Parkinson disease dementia is similar. Lewy bodies eventually develop in the cortex in patients with Parkinson disease, increasing with disease severity and the progression of cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Alpha-synuclein is a normal synaptic protein that may have a role in vesicle production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. An aggregated and insoluble form of alpha-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies. The mechanism underlying the accumulation of alpha-synuclein is not well understood.</p><p>Other neuropathologic findings are often present in DLB:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lewy neurites are degenerating neuronal processes that stain positively for ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein. They are found in the CA2 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, the transentorhinal cortex, the nucleus basalis of Meynert, amygdala, dorsal vagal nucleus, and other brainstem nuclei. Use of monoclonal antibodies against alpha-synuclein has also detected an extensive burden of Lewy pathology in the striatum of patients with DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amyloid plaques are seen in most cases of DLB but may be less numerous than in Alzheimer disease (AD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. At autopsy, most patients with DLB meet plaque burden criteria for AD. Similarly, patients with DLB have evidence of amyloid plaque burden on Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PIB-PET) that is higher than healthy controls and individuals with Parkinson's disease, but lower and more variably distributed than in patients with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark lesion for AD, are generally sparse or even absent in DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].
