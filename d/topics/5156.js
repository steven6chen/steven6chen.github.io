Full expansion of the lung can be prevented by inflammatory or fibrotic processes affecting the visceral pleura or by extrapleural processes such as endobronchial obstruction, chronic lung atelectasis, or processes that will increase the elastic recoil of the lung (ie, interstitial lung disease or lymphangitic carcinomatosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Unexpandable lung usually comes to medical attention when removal of pleural fluid does not result in lung reexpansion.

Both of these processes are associated with the presence of pleural fluid.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In lung entrapment, the lung cannot expand fully because of an active disease, such as malignancy or infection that restricts expansion of the lung <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> visceral pleura. The pleural fluid analysis is usually consistent with an exudate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In trapped lung, the lung cannot expand because of a remote inflammatory condition that has left behind a collagenous or fibrous peel on the visceral pleura. The pleural fluid analysis is consistent with a transudate or a protein-discordant exudate and has a mononuclear cell predominance. Most causes of trapped lung begin as a form of lung entrapment. The one exception is malignancy, where the vast majority of patients die as a result of the metastatic process. While most cases of lung entrapment resolve with resolution of the inflammatory process, in others, the resolution is incomplete resulting in a trapped lung. Therefore, a trapped lung and lung entrapment may represent a continuum of the same disease process. </p><p/><p>In addition to the absence of active pleural disease in patients with trapped lung, these entities can be differentiated by the particular patterns of pleural pressure or elastance (change in pleural pressure divided by the amount of pleural fluid removed) noted during thoracentesis. The key reasons to differentiate these entities are to identify active processes that require specific treatment and to avoid unnecessary pleural procedures in patients with trapped lung. The technique of measuring pleural pressure and the interpretation of the results are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-pleural-pressure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of pleural pressure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LUNG ENTRAPMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54982991\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lung entrapment is most commonly caused by pleural malignancy, but can also be caused by pleural infection or inflammation (eg, rheumatoid pleuritis). Additionally, parenchymal processes such as pneumonia, lung cancer, or endobronchial obstruction can result in a pleural effusion and the lung may not expand due to the increased elastic recoil of the lung. Among malignant causes of lung entrapment, mesothelioma, primary lung cancer, and breast cancer are most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Lung entrapment complicates at least 30 percent of malignant pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63531199\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a malignant pleural effusion is complicated by lung entrapment, fluid formation is due to a combination of increased capillary filtration (leakiness) due to tumor involvement and decreased clearance due to infiltration of draining lymphatics. It is likely that the fluid accumulates until the pleural pressure normalizes at which point it stabilizes, forming a pleural effusion of a constant size. Likewise, empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusion may be associated with lung entrapment but the mechanism of persistence of pleural fluid is largely dependent on the underlying condition. These mechanisms are described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-pleural-liquid-accumulation-in-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of pleural liquid accumulation in disease&quot;, section on 'Effusion formation by site'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63531420\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical, radiographic, and laboratory features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a pleural effusion due to lung entrapment may be asymptomatic though they typically have shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance, or chest discomfort. Patients with pleural infection often have fever and may have cough or sputum production. Lung entrapment due to rheumatoid pleuritis may be associated with other clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis, although pleural disease can be the presenting manifestation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-systemic-and-nonarticular-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the systemic and nonarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Asymptomatic lung entrapment may be identified during imaging studies obtained to evaluate a known malignancy. On computed tomography or ultrasound, the pleural surface may appear nodular, thickened, or hyperechoic and the pleural fluid loculated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Likewise, visceral pleural thickening can be visualized with ultrasound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pleural-effusions-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pleural effusions in adults&quot;, section on 'Malignant pleural effusion'</a>.)</p><p>A key feature of lung entrapment is that although dyspnea typically improves with thoracentesis, the underlying lung does not fully expand radiographically after draining the pleural fluid. It is important to understand that if patients experience an improvement in dyspnea, even if the lung does not re-expand, they can achieve significant pleural palliation by placement of indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs). Some patients, generally those with malignant effusions, develop chest discomfort during therapeutic thoracentesis despite having a considerable amount of residual pleural fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is thought that the chest discomfort is related to the negative pleural pressure created in the pleural space when the lung does not reexpand to fill the space created by fluid removal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pleural-effusions-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pleural effusions in adults&quot;, section on 'Conventional radiography'</a>.) </p><p>The pleural fluid is typically exudative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. When lung entrapment is caused by pleural malignancy, malignant cells may be present on cytology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of lung entrapment is not always obvious but sometimes can be suspected during the initial evaluation of a pleural effusion. In the presence of a large effusion, contralateral shift of the mediastinum is expected. If the mediastinum is not shifted, or is shifted ipsilaterally, lung entrapment should be suspected. The diagnosis should also be suspected when a patient with known rheumatoid arthritis, empyema, or malignancy presents with a pleural effusion. Identification of lung entrapment in a patient with a malignant pleural effusion is important, because if the lung cannot reexpand, pleurodesis will likely not be successful. In this case, IPCs are an option for management of dyspnea in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Lung entrapment may also be suspected if there is a lack of lung re-expansion with thoracentesis, although other processes (eg, endobronchial obstruction by a tumor associated with a malignant effusion, significant underlying pulmonary fibrosis or consolidation) can have the same effect. Computed tomography of the chest can help exclude extrapleural causes of unexpandable lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89596\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89596 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>When lung entrapment is suspected, support for the diagnosis is provided by compatible elastance findings (ie, a decrease in pleural pressure of -20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O or lower per liter of fluid removed) and an increased pleural elastance measured at the end of thoracentesis when minimal pleural fluid remains (ie, the terminal elastance) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75040\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75040 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59718\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59718 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The technique of measuring pleural pressure and the interpretation of the results are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-pleural-pressure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of pleural pressure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After a thoracentesis, lung entrapment (or trapped lung) may be suspected if a post-thoracentesis radiograph shows air in the pleural space. The presence of air may not indicate pneumothorax due to a puncture of the lung but may point to the entry of air alongside the pleural drainage catheter in response to the negative pleural pressure generated when the lung cannot reexpand to fill the hemithorax. These pneumothoraces can often be visualized at the lung base, as can visceral pleural thickening.</p><p>Direct visualization via thoracoscopy provides confirmation of the diagnosis, but is usually only necessary when the cause of lung entrapment is unclear or the patient has refractory symptoms. Occasionally, the diagnosis of lung entrapment only becomes apparent at the time of a thoracoscopy performed to evaluate a persistent undiagnosed effusion. That being said, it can be difficult to predict unexpandable lung at the time of medical thoracoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

For patients with a treatable underlying condition such as infection or inflammation, lung entrapment often resolves with treatment of the underlying process (eg, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parapneumonic effusion and empyema in adults&quot;, section on 'Management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lung disease associated with rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Treatment of rheumatoid pleural effusion'</a>.)</p><p>Lung entrapment due to pleural malignancy rarely responds to chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since the dyspnea of pleural effusions is not related to lung collapse, low oxygen levels or loss of FEV<sub>1</sub>, but is more likely a chest wall phenomenon due to flattening of the diaphragm, patients with lung entrapment can achieve significant improvements in dyspnea after pleural fluid drainage despite lack of lung expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Options for managing lung entrapment in this setting include placement of an indwelling tunneled pleural catheter, occasionally placement of a pleuroperitoneal shunt, and rarely <span class=\"nowrap\">pleurectomy/decortication</span> which is associated with a very high morbidity and mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88662343\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent symptoms after relief of dyspnea with thoracentesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic improvement with thoracentesis suggests efforts to reduce pleural fluid accumulation will provide continued symptomatic relief. Because patients with malignancy may have many causes of dyspnea (ie, pulmonary emboli, deconditioning, airway obstruction), if patients do not feel better after thoracentesis, causes other than the effusion should be investigated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pleurodesis</strong> &#9472; Pleurodesis is commonly used to treat recurrent and persistent malignant pleural effusions without lung entrapment. However, it is unlikely to be successful in patients with entrapped lung, because the lung is unable to expand adequately to achieve apposition between the parietal and visceral pleura. One study found that pleurodesis failed in all 19 patients with pleural malignancy and lung entrapment demonstrated by a drop in pleural pressure greater than 19 cm H<sub>2</sub>O after removal of 500 mL of pleural fluid (38 cm H<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">O/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

IPCs are less invasive than placement of pleuroperitoneal shunt and avoid frequent visits for therapeutic thoracentesis. Indwelling pleural catheters are also used for patients with malignant pleural effusions without lung entrapment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In a series of 250 patients with lung entrapment due to pleural malignancy, placement of an indwelling pleural catheter resulted in partial or complete symptomatic improvement in many. The risk of infection with IPCs, even in patients receiving chemotherapy, is quite low (approximately 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pleuroperitoneal shunt</strong> &#9472; Insertion of a pleuroperitoneal shunt is a rarely used option for patients with lung entrapment who do not want a chronic transcutaneous device with the accompanying need for special cleaning and drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/3,13,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,19,20</a>]. These shunts are placed via thoracoscopic guidance under general anesthesia. In the hands of experienced operators, placement of a pleuroperitoneal shunt is reasonably safe, although shunt-related complications (eg, infection, occlusion) occur in about 15 percent. Because pressure is generally higher in the peritoneal than in the pleural space, the patient must compress the pump chamber multiple times a day to move fluid &quot;uphill.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of malignant pleural effusions&quot;, section on 'Shunt'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, we prefer using an indwelling pleural catheter rather than a pleuroperitoneal shunt due to the fewer problems and less invasive process for placement of indwelling pleural catheters.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103659118\"><span class=\"h3\">Inadequate improvement with pleural fluid removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with lung entrapment due to malignancy and inadequate or no improvement with pleural fluid removal, pleurectomy (resection of visceral and parietal pleura) with decortication (removal of pleural rind) is a potential option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. Candidates for pleurectomy should have refractory shortness of breath, be in good overall condition, and have a primary tumor that is under control or progressing slowly. Pleurectomy controls the pleural effusion in over 90 percent of cases; however, it is a major operation with a mortality rate of about 5 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It is rarely performed for lung entrapment.

The incidence of trapped lung is unknown but is probably much higher than is generally recognized. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54982978\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The event producing the initial pleural inflammation is usually pneumonia or a hemothorax, but other causes include spontaneous pneumothorax, thoracic operations including coronary artery bypass surgery, uremia, and rheumatoid pleuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Trapped lung can also be a late consequence of nonmalignant lung entrapment, if the underlying inflammatory condition is successfully treated but the restricting fibrinous peel becomes organized into a fibrous peel with wide separation of the visceral and parietal pleurae. Rarely, patients with heart failure develop a trapped lung and a pleural effusion if they have a pleural effusion for many months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63531158\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In trapped lung, the fibrotic process affecting the visceral pleura prevents the lung from expanding to fill the thoracic cavity when pleural fluid is removed. In this situation, the negative pleural pressure increases the entry of liquid into the space and reduces the exit of pleural fluid by pleural lymphatics and, thereby, leads to the formation of the effusion. Consequently, a steady state of fluid formation and removal is established, leading to persistence of a negative pressure pleural effusion of constant volume. The sole mechanism for the persistence of the pleural effusion is mechanical and can be considered a &quot;pleural effusion ex-vacuo,&quot; that is, it is the negative pleural pressure that <strong>causes </strong>the pleural effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/21,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,28</a>].

These patients typically present for a routine examination, are found to have findings consistent with an effusion (decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion, and decreased fremitus) and are referred for a thoracentesis. These patients will typically have discomfort throughout the thoracentesis due to further reductions in intrathoracic pressure. Some patients, however, complain of shortness of breath due to a restrictive ventilatory defect. Symptoms of acute pleural inflammation such as pleuritic chest pain or fever are rarely present, but a careful history will often elicit these symptoms in the remote past.</p><p>Over time, the size of an effusion due to trapped lung remains remarkably constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. If thoracentesis is performed, the effusion recurs rapidly. The pleural fluid lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) is usually in the transudative or borderline exudative range, while pleural fluid protein may be either in the transudative or exudative range. Typically, the pleural fluid white blood cell count is relatively low and primarily consists of mononuclear cells.

The paradoxical finding that the hemithorax with the effusion is reduced in size compared to the contralateral side suggests that pleural pressure on the affected side is more negative than on the opposite side, providing further evidence for the diagnosis of trapped lung. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pleural-effusions-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pleural effusions in adults&quot;, section on 'Loculated pleural effusions'</a>.)</p><p>As mentioned for entrapped lung, a post-thoracentesis radiograph can show air in the pleural space (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Lung entrapment'</a> above). In the situation of trapped lung, the air can appear with the same size and shape as the prior effusion; in this setting, the air does not represent a complication of thoracentesis, but replacement of the fluid by air which has entered due to the low pressure, probably along the catheter tract or due to a minor break in technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>In some patients, the visceral pleural rind associated with trapped lung is difficult to visualize on routine CT. To improve visualization of the pleural rind, an air contrast CT can be performed by injecting 200 to 400 mL of air at the termination of a therapeutic thoracentesis and obtaining a chest CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>]. The air in the pleural space allows a clear demarcation on CT images of the thickness of the visceral pleura, and will also allow for an increase in the negative pleural pressure, alleviating the patient's discomfort. In a case series, air contrast CT allowed visualization of visceral pleural rinds that were less than 3 mm, which is thicker than the minimally visible normal pleura but difficult to visualize in the absence of air contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

In patients with trapped lung, the initial pleural pressure is usually slightly negative, and the pressure decreases quickly as pleural fluid is withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These patients typically have <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/discomfort</span> throughout the procedure. The pleural space elastance (change in pleural pressure divided by the amount of pleural fluid removed) exceeds 14.5 cm H<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">O/L</span> in the presence of trapped lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75040\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75040 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-pleural-pressure#H933967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of pleural pressure&quot;, section on 'Technique'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-pleural-pressure#H933974\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of pleural pressure&quot;, section on 'Interpretation of pleural pressures'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of trapped lung based on pleural pressures can be complicated in patients with more than one cause of pleural effusion. As an example, a patient may have heart failure with hydrostatic accumulation of pleural fluid in addition to trapped lung. In this situation, the initial pleural elastance is normal, correlating with partial lung reexpansion when fluid due to the hydrostatic component is removed, but the terminal elastance is abnormally high correlating with the presence of unexpandable lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/1,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-pleural-pressure#H934433\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of pleural pressure&quot;, section on 'Pleural elastance'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-pleural-pressure#H933974\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of pleural pressure&quot;, section on 'Interpretation of pleural pressures'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of characteristic pleural pressure changes is strongly suggestive of trapped lung and may be sufficient diagnostically in patients with minimal or absent symptoms. However, confirmation that visceral pleural thickening (a pleural rind) is present requires direct visualization via video-assisted thoracoscopy or air contrast CT. We typically obtain air contrast CT when pleural manometry (ie, high elastance) suggests that the area of trapped lung is moderate to large. Air injected into the pleural space at the completion of thoracentesis allows a clear demarcation of the thickness of the visceral pleura and the proportion of the lung that is affected. This information is also helpful in subsequent management decisions. The technique of air contrast CT is described above. (See <a href=\"#H25147598\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of trapped lung</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of a pleural effusion caused by trapped lung largely depends on the patient's symptoms. For patients who are asymptomatic, no further therapy is indicated, because performing further pleural drainage procedures will just lead to fluid reaccumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Rarely, a patient's quality of life is limited by shortness of breath because the constricting fibrous rind involves a large portion of the lung. For these patients, decortication of the visceral pleura (removal of fibrous pleural rind) may allow reexpansion of the trapped lung and resolution of the restrictive ventilator defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/1,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32</a>]. </p><p>The evidence in favor of decortication comes from case reports, small case series, and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/1,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26,27</a>]. In a series of patients with trapped lung following coronary artery bypass grafting, three of the four patients who underwent decortication had successful lung reexpansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Prior to decortication, other potential causes of dyspnea should be excluded by noninvasive testing (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dyspnea&quot;</a>). As an example, a patient with rheumatoid pleuritis may have underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD) that may contribute to their dyspnea. In that case, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest can be used to assess for ILD in the underlying lung parenchyma. Finally, candidates for decortication need to be acceptable surgical candidates who understand the risks associated with general anesthesia and thoracotomy or thoracoscopy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13270434\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unexpandable lung is present when the lung is unable to expand to meet the chest wall and achieve visceral and parietal pleural apposition. The two types of pleural processes that cause unexpandable lung are lung entrapment and trapped lung; both are associated with the presence of a pleural effusion.

For such patients who obtain at least partial relief of symptoms after thoracentesis, we recommend implantation of an indwelling pleural catheter for intermittent drainage at home, rather than placement of a pleuroperitoneal shunt (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Placement of an indwelling catheter is preferred over the shunt placement because the indwelling catheter placement is less invasive and has fewer complications. Despite these risks, some patients may prefer a shunt to avoid a transcutaneous device due to issues about appearance, cleaning, and drainage.
