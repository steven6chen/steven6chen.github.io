Although some women do not mind missing their menstrual period, these changes should always be discussed with a health care provider because they can signal underlying medical conditions and potentially have long-term health consequences. A woman who misses more than three menstrual periods (either consecutively or over the course of a year) should see a health care provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Amenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstrual periods, and is classified as either:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary (when menstrual periods have not started by age 15 years)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary (when menstrual periods are absent for more than three to six months in a woman who previously had periods)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Oligomenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oligomenorrhea is the medical term for infrequent menstrual periods (fewer than six to eight periods per year).</p><p>The causes, evaluation, and treatment of amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea are similar and will be discussed together.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF IRREGULAR PERIODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The brain (including the hypothalamus and pituitary gland), ovaries, and uterus normally follow a sequence of events once per month that helps to prepare the body for pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79496\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79496 \">figure 1</a>). Two hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), are made by the pituitary gland. Two other hormones, progesterone and estrogen, are made by the ovaries.</p><p>Menstrual cycle disorders can result from conditions that affect the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovaries, uterus, cervix, or vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary amenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the more common causes of primary amenorrhea include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions that are present at birth but may not be noticed until puberty. These conditions include genetic or chromosomal abnormalities and abnormalities of the reproductive organs (eg, if the uterus is not present or developed abnormally).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All of the conditions that lead to secondary amenorrhea can also cause primary amenorrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary amenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy is the most common of secondary amenorrhea. Other common causes include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and ovarian insufficiency (early menopause).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothalamic amenorrhea. This occurs when the hypothalamus slows or stops releasing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a hormone that influences when a woman has a menstrual period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hypothalamic amenorrhea is associated with low body weight (defined as weighing 10 percent below ideal body weight) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-for-adults-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-for-adults-metric-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 2</a>), a low percentage of body fat, eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, emotional stress, strenuous exercise, and some medical conditions or illnesses. However, in some cases, there is no obvious explanation for hypothalamic amenorrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors are another common cause of secondary amenorrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-prolactin-levels-and-prolactinomas-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High prolactin levels and prolactinomas (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Oligomenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the conditions that cause primary or secondary amenorrhea can also cause a woman to ovulate irregularly (oligomenorrhea). However, most women who develop infrequent periods have PCOS. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Polycystic ovary syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF IRREGULAR PERIODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of <span class=\"nowrap\">amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea</span> includes a complete medical history and physical examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are often clues about the cause of amenorrhea in a woman's personal and family medical history. A woman should mention if she had any health problems during infancy or childhood, when her first period started (if there was a first period) and how frequently periods have occurred since. If known, the woman should also mention if there is any family history of irregular menstrual periods.</p><p>Other important points include the presence of discharge from the breasts, hot flashes, adult acne, facial or chest hair, and headaches or impaired vision. The clinician will also ask about any medications, herbs, and vitamins used; recent stress; recent gynecologic procedures; changes in weight, diet, or exercise patterns; and illnesses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the physical examination, the provider will examine the face, neck, breasts, and abdomen. A pelvic examination will also be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending upon the individual, the clinician may order blood tests. Because pregnancy is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea, a pregnancy test is usually recommended for women whose menstrual periods have stopped. Blood tests to measure hormone levels will also be ordered.</p><p>In selected cases, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test may be done to determine if there are hypothalamic or pituitary gland abnormalities in the brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63094\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63094 \">figure 2</a>). Occasionally, in women with a suspected chromosomal abnormality, a chromosome analysis may be recommended. A pelvic ultrasound may be recommended to identify abnormalities of the uterus, cervix, and vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF IRREGULAR PERIODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of treatment is to correct the underlying condition. For a woman who is trying to become pregnant, restoring fertility may be another goal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Ovulation induction with clomiphene (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-treatment-with-gonadotropins-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Infertility treatment with gonadotropins (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Polycystic ovary syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a chronic condition that causes infrequent periods and an excess of androgens (male hormones). Most health care providers recommend treating PCOS to reestablish normal menstrual cycles and prevent long-term complications. PCOS is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothalamic amenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with hypothalamic amenorrhea are sometimes able to resume normal menstrual periods after making certain lifestyle changes, such as eating a higher-calorie diet, gaining weight, reducing the intensity or frequency of exercise, and reducing emotional stress.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low body weight <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nutritional deficiencies &ndash; Women with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia often need specialized care. This usually includes nutrition counseling and work with eating disorder specialists.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strenuous exercise &ndash; Although exercise offers many health benefits, exercising frequently or excessively can lead to amenorrhea. Studies suggest that amenorrhea develops when a woman's caloric intake is less than she burns with exercise and other daily activities. Most women with amenorrhea associated with exercise have also lost weight (resulting in a weight less than 90 percent of the ideal body weight) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-for-adults-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-for-adults-metric-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 2</a>).</p><p/><p>For women with exercise-associated amenorrhea, treatments include increasing calorie intake and reducing the frequency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intensity of exercise. These measures are particularly important if a woman is trying to become pregnant. All women with amenorrhea should be sure to consume 1200 to 1500 mg of calcium daily (or take a calcium supplement) and a vitamin D supplement (400 international units daily). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some clinicians recommend estrogen and progestin hormone replacement (or a hormonal contraceptive, such as a birth control pill) for women with hypothalamic amenorrhea. These treatments can reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis later in life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1124346396\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normally, a woman stops ovulating around the age of 50 years; this is called menopause. If a woman stops ovulating before age 40 years, this is called premature ovarian failure (or primary ovarian insufficiency). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-menopause-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Early menopause (primary ovarian insufficiency) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Being diagnosed with ovarian failure is usually unexpected and can be distressing, especially if the woman has not completed childbearing. In these situations, counseling with a social worker or psychotherapist may be of benefit. With most types of ovarian failure, pregnancy can be achieved using injectable fertility medications and donor eggs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oocyte donation for assisted reproduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although ovarian failure cannot be cured, hormone therapy (HT) with estrogen and progesterone (or a hormonal contraceptive, such as a birth control pill) can help prevent or treat many of the symptoms and long-term consequences of menopause, such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and osteoporosis. HT has risks of its own in older women. However, a young (20- to 50-year-old) woman who takes HT does not have the same risks as a &ge;50-year-old woman who takes HT. Current practice is to provide HT for women with premature ovarian failure until age 50 years, the average age of menopause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">High prolactin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with amenorrhea and hyperprolactinemia can usually have normal menstrual periods and become pregnant when treated with medications called dopamine agonists (bromocriptine and cabergoline are examples). This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-prolactin-levels-and-prolactinomas-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High prolactin levels and prolactinomas (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1124346339\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothalamic or pituitary conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some hypothalamic and pituitary gland conditions that cause amenorrhea, such as a congenital deficiency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), are irreversible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, women with these conditions can have menstrual periods and become pregnant when treated with injectable fertility medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-treatment-with-gonadotropins-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Infertility treatment with gonadotropins (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Endometrial adhesions (Asherman syndrome)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some gynecologic procedures, such as a dilatation and curettage (D and C), can cause adhesions (a type of scar tissue), which damage the uterine lining. If adhesions are extensive, menstrual blood loss will be reduced or absent. A clinician may recommend surgery to remove the scarred tissue, followed by estrogen treatment to stimulate regrowth of the lining. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilation-and-curettage-d-and-c-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Dilation and curettage (D and C) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1124346294\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is often an effective treatment if amenorrhea is caused by a blockage in the reproductive tract.
