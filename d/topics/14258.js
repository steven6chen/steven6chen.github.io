It is a disorder characterized by ischemic necrosis of the intestinal mucosa, which is associated with inflammation, invasion of enteric gas-forming organisms, and dissection of gas into the muscularis and portal venous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although early recognition and aggressive treatment of this disorder has improved clinical outcomes, NEC accounts for substantial long-term morbidity in survivors of neonatal intensive care, particularly in preterm very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW below 1500 g). As a result, research efforts have focused on finding interventions that will reduce the risk and severity of this disorder.</p><p>The prevention of NEC will be reviewed here. The pathology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of this disorder are discussed separately.

The use of human milk versus formula has been shown to reduce the risk of NEC. Other commonly-used preventive measures, most of which have less support, include having a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) feeding protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], judicious advancement of enteral feeding (between 15 and 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], the avoidance of hypertonic formulas, hypertonic medications, or contrast agents that may injure the intestinal mucosa, and prompt treatment of polycythemia. These measures are routinely performed in the management of infants cared for in the NICU.

This was best illustrated by a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials which demonstrated that the risk of NEC was increased 2.8 times in infants who were fed formula compared with those who were fed donor human milk (relative risk [RR] 2.77, 95% CI 1.40-5.46) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, in many units, if mothers' own milk is unavailable, pasteurized donor human milk is used, which appears to decrease the risk of NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

If mother's milk is not available by 24 hours after delivery, we use donor human milk.

Although available evidence has suggested that probiotics may be beneficial, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend the routine use of probiotic therapy in preterm infants to prevent NEC because of inconsistency of the data, the lack of an established regimen of optimal strain and dosing, and the absence of quality control regulation to ensure consistency and safety of product, similar to what is required for any medication.</p><p>The largest clinical trial to date of 1315 preterm infants (gestational age [GA] between 23 and 30 weeks) demonstrated no difference in the incidence of Bell stage II or III NEC between patients randomly assigned to receive the probiotic <em>Bifidobacterium breve</em> BBG-001 compared with the placebo group (9 versus 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There was also no difference in mortality (8 versus 9 percent) or the risk of sepsis (11 versus 12 percent).</p><p>However, a subsequently published 2016 meta-analysis that included this latest clinical trial reported that probiotics reduced the risk of NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In this brief report, there was no mention regarding the quality of the included studies or heterogeneity amongst the studies. A 2014 systematic review of trials in preterm infants &lt;37 weeks gestation or birth weight (BW) &lt;2500 g, which did not include the above trial, reported that preparations that contained bacterial strains of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactobacillus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Lactobacillus</a> alone or in combination with <em>Bifidobacterium </em>reduced the risk of NEC and mortality, but noted a large variability in the quality of the studies and a great deal of heterogeneity amongst the studies, including enrollment criteria (eg, BW and GA), baseline risk of NEC in the control groups, timing, dose, formulation of the probiotics, and feeding regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A follow-up study of one of the trials included in both systematic reviews demonstrated no difference in the growth and neurodevelopmental and sensory outcomes between the probiotic and placebo groups at three years corrected age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Bacteriemia from the bacterial probiotic strain or contamination of the probiotic product is an uncommon but serious and potentially fatal adverse event, as illustrated by the following case reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case report of <em>Bifidobacterium longum </em>bacteremia in two preterm infants demonstrated that the strains isolated from each patient were derived from the probiotic preparations given to the patients to prevent NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fatal case of mucormycosis was reported in a preterm infant who received the probiotic supplement Solgar ABC Dophilus Powder for prevention of NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

We suggest that the use of probiotics for prevention of NEC be limited to well-designed clinical trials. Even if there is unequivocal evidence of benefits without undue harm from probiotic use, challenges that need to be addressed before recommending routine use to prevent NEC include the need to establish a standard regimen of optimal strain and dosing, and quality control measures that ensure the administration of a safe and consistent product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOGLOBULINS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral immunoglobulins may reduce NEC by inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, data either are limited or do not support the use of these interventions to prevent NEC.</p><p>The most promising nutritional supplement is lactoferrin, an iron-binding glycoprotein and a component of the mammalian innate response to infection. It is the major whey protein in colostrum, breast milk, tears, and saliva. A systematic review of the literature reported a lower risk of NEC (stage II or greater) for preterm infants randomly assigned to oral lactoferrin prophylaxis alone compared with placebo (relative risk [RR] 0.30, 95% CI 0.12-0.76) or in combination with a probiotic agent (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.0-0.66) based on <strong>low</strong> quality evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There were no reported adverse effects. A large clinical trial is being undertaken to determine whether prophylactic lactoferrin is a cost-effective and safe preventive measure to reduce NEC in preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In light of the preliminary nature of these studies and the poor quality of the evidence, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend the routine use of lactoferrin for the prevention of NEC pending further larger, multicenter studies.</p><p>Other interventions include the amino acids <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">arginine</a> and glutamine:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Arginine</a> &ndash; In a systematic review of the literature, arginine supplementation appeared to be protective, with a lower rate of NEC in the group that received arginine compared with those given placebo (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23-0.64) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There was no difference in adverse effects and neurodevelopmental outcome between the two groups. Nevertheless, data are inadequate to recommend arginine supplementation to prevent NEC due to the small number of patients that have been enrolled in clinical trials.

In this study of 11,072 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (range of BW 401 to 1500 g) from 1998 to 2001, the incidence of NEC was 7.1 percent.

In this cohort, 96 percent of neonates received empirical antibiotic therapy, and the median duration of antibiotic therapy was five days. The use of prolonged initial empiric antibiotic (&ge;5 days duration) started in the first three days of life was associated with an increased risk of NEC or death (61 versus 51 percent). Each additional day of antibiotic therapy beyond five days was associated with additional increased risks of NEC or death. Patients who received prolonged antibiotic therapy in the absence of positive culture results were more likely to have a lower gestational age (GA), BW, and Apgar scores, be black, and be born more than 24 hours after rupture of membranes.</p><p>The authors acknowledge that these findings must be balanced by the observation that sterile culture results may not be reliable as the required blood culture volumes, for reliable detection for bacteremia may not be consistently available in these extremely small infants. However, these findings suggest that limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy in infants with sterile culture results reduces the risk of NEC and death in ELBW infants.</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a retrospective case-control study from a single center that demonstrated the risk of NEC rose with increasing duration of initial antibiotic exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].
