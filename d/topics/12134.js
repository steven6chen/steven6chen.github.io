While prosthetic materials have replaced the arterial homografts used originally, the technical conduct of the operation has remained largely unchanged for more than 60 years. Open surgical repair of abdominal aneurysm has proven to be safe, widely available, effective in preventing aneurysm rupture, and remarkably durable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm is performed under general anesthesia with appropriate monitoring of volume status and fluid administration and transfusion, as needed. Repair of the aorta is carried out in a systematic fashion that involves clamping the aorta to stop blood flow, opening the aneurysm to remove thrombus and debris from within the aorta, and suturing a synthetic graft to replace the diseased arterial segment.</p><p>The preoperative evaluation and preparation, operative technique, and postoperative care and follow-up of patients undergoing AAA repair is reviewed here. General issues regarding management of AAA and the surgical and endovascular management of ruptured AAA are discussed elsewhere.

From a practical standpoint, an infrarenal aortic diameter greater than 3.0 cm (measured outer wall-to-outer wall) is considered aneurysmal for most individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Aortoiliac anatomy is discussed in detail elsewhere.

AAAs most often occur in the segment of aorta between the renal arteries and the bifurcation of the aorta. Only 5 percent of aortic aneurysms involve the renal or visceral arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60682\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60682 \">figure 2</a>). Up to 40 percent of AAAs are associated with iliac artery aneurysm(s). The presence of iliac artery aneurysm may necessitate placement of a bifurcated graft. The extent of the aneurysm also affects the surgical approach. (See <a href=\"#H365977605\" class=\"local\">'Incision and aortic exposure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365977525\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273861029\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioperative morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with advanced age; female sex; and severe cardiac, pulmonary, liver, or kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Preoperative consultation with the anesthesia team is appropriate. Medical risk assessment and factors that assist in determining the appropriateness of open surgical repair for a specific patient are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H3585830\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Medical risk assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair are often taking medications for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Patients who are currently taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, beta blockers, and lipid-lowering therapy should continue these medications throughout the perioperative period. Many surgeons prefer to discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> prior to surgery if not indicated for coronary drug-eluting stent. For patients who are not currently taking these medications, whether or not and when to initiate therapy is reviewed separately.

The updated guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) endorse the use of a scoring system derived from data collected by the Vascular Study Group of New England, part of the national Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Using this dataset, major factors that affect in-hospital mortality after elective AAA repair were identified.

As an example, the estimated risk of mortality with open AAA repair for a 55-year-old otherwise healthy woman with a 5.0-cm aneurysm is &lt;1 percent. By comparison, a 75-year-old man with a 6.5-cm juxtarenal AAA and a history of COPD, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease with a serum creatinine level &gt;2.0 has an estimated risk of mortality of more than 40 percent. It is recommended that the estimated risk of mortality be included during informed consent discussions.</p><p>The SVS also recommends that open AAA repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of &lt;5 percent and that perform at least 10 open aortic procedures annually. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365977647\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The status of the peripheral circulation should be assessed prior to open repair of AAA. The clinical examination should focus on the identification of coexistent aneurysms (eg, iliac aneurysm, popliteal aneurysm) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occlusive disease. The diagnosis and management of peripheral aneurysms and peripheral artery disease are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iliac-artery-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iliac artery aneurysm&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients who present with lower extremity symptoms such as claudication, noninvasive vascular studies (ankle-brachial index, segmental pressures) should be performed. The character and location of peripheral pulses should be noted for comparison at the completion of the aneurysm repair. If computed tomography (CT) imaging of the aneurysm has not included lower extremities, duplex arterial imaging can be performed to assess the distal vasculature, rather than repeat CT or arteriography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The preoperative sexual health of the patient should be documented. In the past, postoperative sexual dysfunction was thought to be related to pelvic arterial insufficiency alone, or in combination with intraoperative injury to the autonomic nerves located to the left of the aortic bifurcation. It has been demonstrated that preoperative sexual dysfunction is common in the population of patients with abdominal aneurysm. In the Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm Management (DREAM) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], more than 60 percent of patients admitted symptoms of sexual dysfunction preoperatively. Repair of AAA, open or endovascular, was associated with modest deterioration in reported sexual function in the early postoperative period, which casts doubt on the true incidence of sexual dysfunction that results directly from aneurysm repair. Nonetheless, every effort should be made to avoid autonomic nerve injury and preserve arterial blood flow to the internal iliac arteries, whenever possible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273863881\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to open AAA repair, CT angiography is the imaging test of choice to evaluate the location (eg, infrarenal, suprarenal) and anatomic features (eg, extent of thrombus, calcification, inflammation) of the aneurysm and to identify other abnormalities (eg, retrocaval left renal vein, accessory renal arteries, horseshoe kidney) that may alter the approach to repair. CT has replaced conventional contrast arteriography in the preoperative assessment of aneurysm, but the latter may be appropriate to answer specific anatomic questions (eg, adequacy of pelvic collateral circulation) or to perform preoperative catheter-based intervention in selected patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H15828721\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The extent of exposure during open surgery depends upon the extent of the aneurysm and the identification of suitable arterial sites for clamping and for suturing the proximal and distal anastomoses. In general, preoperative imaging should aid in predicting the proximal and distal extent of exposure. Imaging studies should be reviewed and the extent of thrombus and location of calcification carefully assessed to determine the best locations for arterial clamping. In addition, the presence and location of distal occlusive disease should be identified in patients with diminished femoral, popliteal, or foot pulses. </p><p>The vascular supply to the intestines should also be evaluated. Occlusive vascular disease is frequently present in the visceral circulation in patients with AAA. As an example, the presence of an enlarged meandering mesenteric artery on preoperative imaging should alert the surgeon to the possibility of significant stenosis or occlusion in the superior mesenteric artery. It is incumbent on the surgeon to assure the adequacy of visceral perfusion prior to completion of the case. In some cases, it may be best to revascularize the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) at the time of open aneurysm repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Alternatively, percutaneous visceral revascularization may be performed preoperatively or in conjunction with open repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The status of the SMA also influences the management of the inferior mesenteric artery at the time of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H273864154\" class=\"local\">'Handling the inferior mesenteric artery'</a> below.)</p><p>Horseshoe kidney is a congenital fusion anomaly wherein the lower pole of the one kidney is fused anteriorly across the aorta to the contralateral kidney; fusion at the lower poles is most common. Horseshoe kidney is associated with urologic anomalies including ureteral duplication, ectopic ureter, retrocaval ureter, and supernumerary renal arteries. The location, size, and importance of various renal vessels needs to be determined to prevent postoperative renal ischemia, segmental infarction, hypertension, and acute renal injury. CT angiogram is usually adequate to visualize renal artery anatomy, but conventional arteriography may occasionally be needed. Small vessels originating from the isthmus may be amenable to sacrifice. A retroperitoneal approach is preferred for open AAA repair associated with horseshoe kidney; however, the presence of large renal arteries originating from the iliac arteries will contraindicate a retroperitoneal approach. General features of renal fusion abnormalities are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-ectopic-and-fusion-anomalies#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal ectopic and fusion anomalies&quot;, section on 'Horseshoe kidney'</a>.)</p><p>Inflammatory aneurysm is identified by the presence of contrast-enhancing thickening of the aneurysm wall and perianeurysmal fibrosis. The ureters may be drawn towards the inflammatory process involving the aorta. Approximately 3 percent of abdominal aortic aneurysms have an inflammatory component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Inflammatory aneurysms are more often symptomatic, and perioperative mortality rates appear to be higher following open repair compared with noninflammatory aneurysms. As with any AAA, a choice between open versus an endovascular approach to inflammatory AAA should be based upon patient characteristics and anatomic suitability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H22323992\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Infected versus inflammatory AAA'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273861446\"><span class=\"h3\">Suitability for endovascular repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to embarking on open repair of AAA, it is important to determine if the patient would be better served by endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Perioperative morbidity and mortality is lower for elective endovascular compared with open surgical repair of AAA, but long-term outcomes have not shown to be different. Although advances in endovascular aneurysm repair have extended its use to a large proportion of the elective AAA repair population, open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is still needed for patients with anatomy outside device protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Criteria for endovascular repair and a decision for open versus endovascular AAA repair are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H440175\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Anatomic suitability'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H783739\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Choice of AAA repair approach'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273861335\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to surgery, preoperative baseline laboratories including complete blood count, chemistry panel, and coagulation studies should be obtained. These tests will serve as baseline values for comparison with intraoperative and postoperative studies. The blood bank should determine the patient's blood type and perform a screen for common antibodies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1081435143\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood for transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a review of nearly 4000 open aneurysm operations in the Vascular Quality Initiative database, transfusions were required in 37.5 percent of these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. To minimize the need for cross-matched blood, we recommend the use of blood salvage systems (eg, CellSaver) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Blood salvage&quot;</a>.) </p><p>We suggest that no more than 2 units of typed and cross-matched packed red blood cells (pRBCs) should be made available at the beginning of elective open AAA repair. Cross-matched blood can usually be supplied within a reasonable timeframe if additional blood is needed. Preparing fully cross-matched blood that is not transfused is inefficient since the blood is not available for others, expensive, and may strain the manpower in the blood bank; however, the lag time needed to prepare cross-matched blood depends upon the delivery capacity of the local blood bank and transfusion services. </p><p>For patients with religious beliefs that impact their willingness to accept banked blood, it is important that the surgeon and patient (and patient proxy) have the acceptable conditions governing blood-product transfusion precisely described and recorded in the chart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365977540\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for patients undergoing arterial surgery involving the placement of prosthetic material. Appropriate antibiotics are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87206 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Aortic graft infection is an uncommon but catastrophic complication. A review of data from the Washington State Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System (CHARS) identified 13,902 patients who underwent AAA repair (90 percent open). Bloodstream infection and postoperative surgical site infection were significantly associated with subsequent aortic graft infection, which occurred at a mean of three years following the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition to maintenance of strict sterile technique, the timely administration of prophylactic antibiotics has been shown to reduce the incidence of surgical site infection and graft infection.</p><p>The choice of therapeutic antibiotics in patients found to have infected aneurysm or infected aortic graft will depend upon blood culture and sensitivity results. For patients who have been started on antibiotics due to concerns for infection, antibiotics should be re-dosed prior to surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273861343\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboprophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of deep vein thrombosis following AAA repair ranges from 1 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Most patients undergoing aortic surgery are at moderate-to-high risk for thromboembolism based upon age, comorbidities, and procedure duration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83739 \">table 2</a>). For moderate- to high-risk patients, pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. However, we omit pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for patients with ruptured AAA or impending rupture. We prefer using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> or, alternatively, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fondaparinux</a> for pharmacologic prophylaxis given the potential need for reversal if there are bleeding problems during the surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients#H267528883\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;, section on 'Selecting prophylaxis options'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We also suggest using mechanical thromboprophylaxis for all patients undergoing open AAA repair who will not have their entire lower extremities prepared within the field. In general, this means knee-high rather than thigh-high intermittent pneumatic compression given the potential need in most patients to access the groin vessels during surgery. (See <a href=\"#H365977605\" class=\"local\">'Incision and aortic exposure'</a> below.)</p><p>One survey from Great Britain found a wide diversity in perioperative thromboprophylaxis strategies among vascular surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This variability may be due to firmly held beliefs about the perceived beneficial effects of routine systemic anticoagulation during aortic cross-clamping and concerns over intra- or postoperative bleeding with superimposed thromboprophylaxis. However, the administration of intraoperative heparin should <strong>not</strong> be misconstrued as an appropriate substitute for recommended strategies for thromboprophylaxis.

Interestingly, the diameter of an open surgical graft is invariably smaller than the diameter of an endograft used in the same location.</p><p>The most widely used material is woven polyester fabric. Although favored by some surgeons for its handling qualities, knitted polyester suffers from high porosity as well as a tendency to dilate over time. Conventional woven polyester, on the other hand, is extremely durable but is somewhat less pliable than knitted fabric. Collagen or albumin coating has eliminated the need to &quot;pre-clot&quot; polyester grafts with whole blood. Most modern grafts employ a hybrid structure that combines the benefits of both knitted and woven fabrics (eg, woven double velour), which is easy to handle, durable, and appropriately porous. </p><p>PTFE grafts may be more resistant to infection than polyester, although the data supporting this claim are limited.

Because of the time needed to harvest the vein, sometimes bilaterally, femoral vein has limited use in the routine open surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

Body temperature can be preserved using an air or water circulation pad. It should be noted that use of a lower extremity warm air blanket (eg, Bair-Hugger) is contraindicated during the period of aortic cross-clamping due to the risk of cutaneous burns in the setting of limited skin blood flow. It is useful to monitor central venous pressure, which can be accomplished through a large-bore catheter (eg, 12- to 14-gauge intravenous catheter, or 6- to 8-French introducer sheath) placed into the internal or external jugular vein, and which can also be used to rapidly administer fluids and medications, as needed.

A retroperitoneal approach allows complete exposure of the abdominal aorta in much the same fashion as the transabdominal approach with the exception that the abdominal contents cannot be examined and access to the right common iliac artery is limited, but extension of aortic exposure superiorly is easier. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The advantages of the transperitoneal approach to the aorta, which can be via a midline or transverse incision, are ease and familiarity, ready exposure of the pelvic vasculature, and the ability to directly examine the abdominal viscera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. For transperitoneal incisions, the patient is placed in a supine position with the arms extended or tucked to the patient's sides. When a midline abdominal incision is used, it should be carried from the xiphoid to the pubis to obtain adequate exposure of the aorta proximally to the iliac bifurcation.

The patient is placed in a right semi-lateral position with the left thorax rotated anteriorly and using a beanbag to maintain the position. For most juxtarenal or infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), the retroperitoneal skin incision should start at the tip of the 10<sup>th</sup> rib and be carried inferiorly to the lateral border of the rectus muscle just below the level of the anterior superior iliac spine. For suprarenal AAAs, the incision is initiated more proximally in the 8<sup>th</sup> intercostal space, which extends the incision into the chest and provides more proximal aortic exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H3294667\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Thoracoabdominal'</a>.) </p><p/><p>In trials comparing the transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches, no significant differences between these approaches have been found for perioperative mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]; however, lower rates of postoperative complications (ie, ileus, pneumonia, and incisional hernia) are reported for the retroperitoneal approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A Cochrane review of four small randomized trials (very low or low quality) comparing retroperitoneal and transperitoneal incisions concluded there was no difference in clamp time, operative time, or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Retroperitoneal incisions may be associated with reduced blood loss and shorter intensive care unit and hospital stays; however, the retroperitoneal approach may increase the risk for postoperative wound complications such as flank hernia and chronic pain. In the era of endovascular surgery, some of the factors discussed below that might have suggested a benefit for one incision over the other are more likely to influence a decision in favor of endovascular aneurysm repair, provided AAA anatomy is suitable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>When open repair is elected, the choice of incisional approach is based largely on patient-specific factors such as body habitus and prior abdominal surgery, as well as surgeon experience and preference. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ruptured AAA is usually managed with a midline transperitoneal approach, which allows for expedient aortic clamping.

If major arteries emanate from the isthmus of the kidney, a retroperitoneal approach allows for replantation of individual vessels on a Carrel patch.

Suprarenal or even supraceliac clamping may be needed in this setting. With the increasing use of endovascular aneurysm repair, a greater proportion of open aneurysm repairs will involve complex endograft extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

An elective AAA repair should usually be aborted if there is significant contamination related to inadvertent entry into the digestive or urinary systems. Acute suppurative conditions such as acute appendicitis, diverticulitis, or cholecystitis should be treated in preference to elective AAA repair. A finding of intra-abdominal malignancy usually supports a decision to defer AAA repair in lieu of further evaluation and treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The omentum and transverse colon are retracted cranially and the small bowel retracted to the right. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The peritoneum overlying the infrarenal aorta is incised to the right of the midline to reduce the risk of injury to the inferior mesenteric artery.

This is particularly important if a retroaortic left renal vein has been identified on preoperative computed tomography (CT) angiography. </p><p/><p>Once the aorta has been exposed, the next step is to determine suitable locations for clamp placement. In general, vascular clamps should not be placed in areas of significant thrombus, aneurysm, or calcification. For infrarenal graft placement, normal aortic neck must extend at least one centimeter distal to the position of the infrarenal aortic clamp to allow sufficient space for suture placement. If the aortic neck distal to the renal arteries is insufficient, the suprarenal aorta will need to be exposed to allow the placement of a suprarenal clamp. </p><p>To expose the suprarenal aorta for suprarenal clamp placement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The left renal vein is mobilized. Small venous tributaries may be ligated and divided to improve exposure of the aorta.

The left gonadal vein, the left adrenal vein, and the posterior left lumbar vein should be preserved to assure adequate venous outflow from the left kidney. The Endo GIA stapler with the &quot;white&quot; vascular load may be used to divide the vein. In a review of 261 open AAA repairs, the left renal vein was ligated in 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

The ureters typically cross the distal third of common iliac arteries from lateral to medial. In the presence of iliac aneurysm, the ureter is usually displaced distally toward the iliac bifurcation but may occasionally be encountered more proximally. If injury to the ureter is recognized during dissection but prior to AAA repair, it is usually appropriate to repair the ureter injury and abort the aneurysm repair to reduce the risk of aortic graft infection.

The peritoneum can be bluntly dissected from the abdominal wall and retracted anteriorly. The kidney can be retracted anteriorly or left in place posteriorly depending on aneurysm morphology. As with the transperitoneal approach described above, the aorta should be initially exposed from the renal vessels to the aortic bifurcation.

Then, briefly release the distal clamp(s) to back bleed the distal vessels. If backbleeding is poor, catheter thrombectomy should be performed prior to flow restoration completing the distal anastomosis and restoring flow.

There are four common etiologies of suture line hemorrhage, and each requires a unique treatment. These are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loose suture line &ndash; Due to the thickness of the aortic tissue and the use of self-retaining retractors, it is not uncommon for a suture line to be loose. The most common remedy is to use a nerve hook to take up the slack and then tie the loop to an anchoring suture. This can be facilitated by placing a silk suture through the loop of excess suture to serve as a handle while tying. Be sure to check the nerve hook for any sharp burs or edges on a spare suture because it can cut the suture. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleat formation &ndash; A pleat occurs when the space between adjacent sutures is excessive. A simple stitch placed at the apex of the pleat will usually stop the bleeding. A pledget is not usually required or beneficial, because it may serve to obscure the source of bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needle hole bleeding from the aorta &ndash; If the curve of the needle is not respected while placing a suture, it may cause a longitudinal tear in the aortic wall. This can be repaired by placing a simple figure-of-eight suture (5-0 polypropylene) in the adventitia adjacent to the needle hole.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retraction of the adventitia &ndash; One of the most serious causes of suture line bleeding is caused by not taking full-thickness bites in the aortic wall. This is particularly common on the posterior aspect of the aortic wall. Failure to pass the needle through the full thickness of the aortic wall will result in an anastomosis that is structurally not sound. If this problem is identified, the suture line usually needs to taken down and redone, making certain to obtain full-thickness bites. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1081443051\"><span class=\"h1\">CLOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to closure, distal perfusion should be assessed by palpating the femoral vessel and pedal vessels or by using a handheld Doppler. The quality of the pulses or Doppler signals should be compared with the preoperative examination. If the distal pulses are diminished by comparison, embolization to the infrainguinal vessels may have occurred and femoral embolectomy is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H273864246\" class=\"local\">'Need for thromboembolectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Once adequate flow through the graft and distally has been confirmed, the aneurysm sac should be reapproximated using absorbable sutures to cover the graft and prevent abrasion of the overlying bowel that could lead to aortoenteric fistula formation. (See <a href=\"#H365977695\" class=\"local\">'Graft infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Following open AAA repair, the midline abdominal incision is typically closed primarily. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-abdominal-wall-closure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of abdominal wall closure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One randomized trial suggested that the use of mesh during the initial abdominal closure can help reduce the incidence of incisional hernia following open AAA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Postoperative incisional hernia developed in 16 patients in the control group compared with 5 in the mesh group (hazard ratio 4.10, 95% CI 1.72-9.82). Hernias developed between 170 and 585 days after surgery in the control group, and between 336 and 1122 days in the mesh group. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1081441873\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273864154\"><span class=\"h2\">Handling the inferior mesenteric artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonic ischemia is uncommon following elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. The adequacy of perfusion to the left colon should always be assessed prior to completion of the case, and the inferior mesenteric artery should be reimplanted if there is any question of bowel viability.</p><p>In general, if backbleeding from the orifice of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) within the aneurysm sac is vigorous, indicating adequate collateral flow, or the vessel is occluded (no backbleeding), reimplantation of the IMA into the aortic graft is not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].

There was no significant difference in the incidence of ischemic colitis between the groups (replanted: 6 patients, ligated: 10 patients). However, in patients with prior colon resection or reduced inflow to one or both internal iliac arteries, reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery is appropriate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273864246\"><span class=\"h2\">Need for thromboembolectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All aortic aneurysms have some degree of mural thrombus and cholesterol plaque, which have the potential to dislodge and embolize during the course of aortic dissection and clamping. However, thromboembolism is uncommon with elective AAA repair. Nevertheless, diminished backbleeding from the iliac vessels (or femoral arteries) should prompt Fogarty catheter embolectomy. </p><p>Once the graft has been placed and the vascular clamps have been removed, the femoral pulses should be palpable. If the femoral pulses cannot be palpated, the cause must be determined. After reapplying a clamp on the proximal graft, opening the distal anastomosis is usually the most appropriate initial step, allowing inspection to of the anastomosis for technical defects and passage of a Fogarty balloon catheter distally into the lower extremity vessels. </p><p>Sometimes occlusive disease or excessive tortuosity of the iliac arteries prevents effective passage of the Fogarty catheter. In this case, the common femoral artery should be exposed and a femoral embolectomy performed. If unimpeded inflow can be established, the femoral arteriotomy can be closed primarily; however, if inflow cannot be established, then the aortic graft should be extended to the femoral level. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-to-the-lower-extremities#H2287840559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism to the lower extremities&quot;, section on 'Open embolectomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1081442710\"><span class=\"h2\">Handling the internal iliac arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic arterial inflow is supplied predominately by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery and the bilateral internal iliac arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60420 \">figure 4</a>). Arterial inflow should be preserved to at least one of these vessels. It is always prudent to assess the viability of the colon at the completion of all aortic procedures. Reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery may reduce the risk of colon ischemia in selected cases. (See <a href=\"#H273864154\" class=\"local\">'Handling the inferior mesenteric artery'</a> above.)</p><p>In the absence of prior colon surgery, it is usually safe to ligate the inferior mesenteric artery provided at least one of the internal iliac arteries remains patent. In rare cases, it may be necessary to ligate one or both internal iliac arteries. This occurs most commonly due to extensive aneurysmal involvement of the internal iliac artery deep into the pelvis that precludes arterial reconstruction. In this setting, the inferior mesenteric artery should be replanted to reduce the risk of colon <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic ischemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273864466\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventing and troubleshooting hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant bleeding can complicate AAA repair as a result of gaps in the anastomosis, suture holes (particularly if a polytetrafluoroethylene graft is used), coagulation abnormalities and bleeding from raw surfaces, and inadvertent venous injury (inferior vena cava, renal vein, common iliac vein).</p><p>Troublesome bleeding from the proximal aortic anastomosis may require transecting the aorta to buttress the anastomosis or to obtain adequate exposure to place additional sutures. </p><p>Intraoperative bleeding through needle holes or the raw retroperitoneal surfaces can be managed using topical hemostatic agents, which can help minimize ongoing blood loss, provided there is no bleeding that requires direct suture repair. Preliminary studies using recombinant factor VIIa suggest a potential role in controlling intractable perioperative bleeding in aortic surgery patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

The postoperative course is highly variable depending upon the extent of the procedure and comorbidities of the patient. </p><p>For uncomplicated infrarenal repairs, the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube can be removed in the recovery room. A clear diet can be initiated on the first postoperative day and advanced as tolerated. Early ambulation, appropriate pain control, and respiratory care will help prevent postoperative pulmonary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H365977680\" class=\"local\">'Incisional hernia'</a> below.)</p><p>Thereafter, additional follow-up is dictated by the development of any symptoms (eg, claudication) that might indicate problems with the graft limb anastomoses. Issues related to the proximal aortic anastomosis are uncommon; however, late pseudoaneurysm can occur, and dilation of the proximal aorta has been reported, particularly if the graft was placed too inferiorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. Thus, we routinely obtain computed tomography five years following the open repair to assess the aorta for the late aortic dilation or pseudoaneurysm.

The cause of death for most patients is multisystem organ failure. For patients who survive open AAA repair, the main cause of death in the long-term is cardiovascular disease. In a study that evaluated 297 patients following open <span class=\"nowrap\">infrarenal/juxtarenal</span> AAA repair, cardiovascular events occurred at a rate of 0.16 cardiovascular <span class=\"nowrap\">events/patient-year</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Freedom from cardiovascular events at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years was 94, 67, 46, and 28 percent, respectively. Survival was 97, 75, 51, and 32 percent, respectively. The main cause of death was cardiovascular disease (18.2 percent), followed by cancer (14.5 percent). Only four (1.3 percent) deaths were graft related. </p><p>Complications following open AAA repair are similar to those of other major surgical procedures and are most often related to preexisting medical conditions. Complications include heart failure, myocardial ischemia, acute kidney injury, pulmonary insufficiency, and pneumonia. Management of these complications can be found in separate topic reviews. A thorough preoperative evaluation and proper patient selection help to reduce the incidence of these complications.

The mean time between aortic repairs was 11 years. When compared with 993 other patients for whom endovascular repair was the primary aortic repair, late complications following primary open AAA repair occurred in patients who were significantly younger at the time of their first repair (61 versus 74 years), and more patients had a family history of aneurysm (20 versus 7 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365977664\"><span class=\"h2\">Lower extremity ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower extremity ischemia may occur as a result of arterial occlusion due to clamp injury, arterial wall dissection, or thrombosis or thromboembolism distally.

The incidence of renal dysfunction is greater with suprarenal compared with infrarenal AAA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]; however, even infrarenal clamping can reduce renal blood flow up to 60 percent of normal. In a retrospective review of 2347 patients, renal failure occurred in 140 patients (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Risk factors for postoperative renal failure included age &gt;75, symptomatic AAA, <span class=\"nowrap\">supra/juxtarenal</span> AAA, elevated preoperative serum creatinine, treated hypertension, and respiratory disease.

Patients suspected of postoperative colon ischemia should undergo immediate sigmoidoscopy to assess the viability of the colonic mucosa. Patients with full-thickness ischemia are treated with colon resection. For partial-thickness ischemia, most surgeons recommend bowel rest, antibiotics to cover typical colon flora, and repeat sigmoidoscopy in one to two days to assess resolution or identify progression. It may occasionally be appropriate to consider late reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) for partial-thickness bowel ischemia that does not mandate resection.

(See <a href=\"#H273861343\" class=\"local\">'Thromboprophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients#H267528883\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;, section on 'Selecting prophylaxis options'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not routinely administering mechanical or antibiotic bowel preparation prior to elective, open AAA repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Advocates suggest that bowel preparation reduces the risk of bowel ischemia and may reduce the time to resuming oral intake, and although this continues to be the practice of many surgeons, there is little objective evidence that bowel preparation is beneficial prior to open AAA repair. In addition to being unpleasant for the patient, bowel preparation can be associated with volume and electrolyte depletion. (See <a href=\"#H273861351\" class=\"local\">'Bowel preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The abdominal aorta can be exposed through a midline transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach. A retroperitoneal approach allows full exposure of the abdominal aorta in much the same fashion as the transabdominal approach, with the exception that the abdominal contents cannot be examined and access to the right common iliac artery is limited, but extension of aortic exposure superiorly is easier. The choice of approach is based largely on the clinical situation or the patient's anatomy, as well as patient preference and the surgeon's experience and preference. In the era of endovascular surgery, some of the factors that might have suggested a benefit of one incision over the other are more likely to influence a decision in favor of endovascular aneurysm repair, provided AAA anatomy is suitable. (See <a href=\"#H365977605\" class=\"local\">'Incision and aortic exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic aneurysm repair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56289\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56289 \">figure 3</a>) is carried out in a systematic fashion. After aortic exposure and clamping, the graft is sutured into the proximal aorta and sutured distally at the aortic bifurcation or to the iliac or femoral vessels, whichever is deemed appropriate. Graft options for aortic replacement include polyester (eg, Dacron), polytetrafluoroethylene, and autogenous vein. (See <a href=\"#H273864129\" class=\"local\">'Aortic graft placement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest systemic anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> (50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/kg)</span> prior to cross-clamping the aorta during elective AAA repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We maintain the activated clotting time &gt;200 seconds. Although we generally reverse heparin with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protamine-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protamine sulfate</a> after completion of the aneurysm repair and assessment of the extremity circulation, heparin reversal with protamine has never been shown to be of benefit, and there are potential serious side effects. (See <a href=\"#H45240341\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation and reversal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All aortic aneurysms have some degree of mural thrombus and cholesterol plaque, which have the potential to dislodge and embolize during the course of aortic dissection and clamping. However, thromboembolism is uncommon with elective AAA repair. Prior to closure, distal perfusion should be assessed by palpating the femoral vessel and pedal vessels or by using a handheld Doppler. The quality of the pulses or Doppler signals should be compared with the preoperative examination. If the pulses are diminished, embolectomy should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H273864246\" class=\"local\">'Need for thromboembolectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonic ischemia is uncommon following elective AAA repair. Pelvic arterial inflow should be preserved to at least one vessel (inferior mesenteric artery, right internal iliac artery, left internal iliac artery). Reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery may reduce the risk of colon ischemia in selected patients, particularly those with prior colon resection or reduced inflow to one or both internal iliac arteries. (See <a href=\"#H273864154\" class=\"local\">'Handling the inferior mesenteric artery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1081442710\" class=\"local\">'Handling the internal iliac arteries'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative (30-day) mortality for elective open AAA repair in contemporary series is between 1 and 5 percent. Perioperative morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with advanced age; female sex; or cardiac, pulmonary, or kidney disease. The cause of death for most patients is multisystem organ failure. For patients who survive open AAA repair, the main cause of death in the long term is cardiovascular disease. Perioperative complications related to the aortic procedure include lower extremity ischemia, bowel ischemia, pelvic ischemia, and renal dysfunction, and late complications include incisional hernia, anastomotic aneurysm, and graft <span class=\"nowrap\">infection/aortoenteric</span> fistula.
