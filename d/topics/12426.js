A number of steps should ideally be followed to achieve maximum accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. An appropriately sized cuff must be used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115863\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115863 \">table 1</a>).

Some automated devices can take multiple consecutive readings in the office with the patient sitting and resting alone (ie, unattended measurement). This technique, known as unattended automated office blood pressure monitoring (AOBPM), better predicts the results of ABPM than traditional office blood pressure measurement and may reduce the white coat effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults#H1019514370\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Automated oscillometric blood pressure measurement'</a>.)</p><p>Given the importance of obtaining accurate and reproducible blood pressure readings, we suggest that all providers work towards having access to ABPM, AOBPM, or both.</p><p>However, if AOBPM is not available, office measurements should be performed with the patient positioned properly and allowed to rest comfortably for at least five minutes, and measurements should be repeated at least twice. The average of these readings should also be provided to the patient.</p><p>In addition to obtaining multiple blood pressure measurements, blood pressure should be measured in both arms at least at the initial visit. In older individuals or those with potential orthostatic symptoms, postural measurements should also be taken:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic blood pressure readings in the left and right arms should be roughly equivalent. A discrepancy of more than 15 mmHg may indicate subclavian stenosis and, hence, peripheral arterial disease.

High-quality data suggest that ABPM predicts target-organ damage and cardiovascular events better than office blood pressure readings. ABPM records the blood pressure at preset intervals (usually every 15 to 20 minutes during the day and every 30 to 60 minutes during sleep). ABPM can identify or confirm white coat and masked hypertension and can also be used to confirm normal blood pressure readings obtained by self-monitoring at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is also the only method of blood pressure measurement that can reliably obtain nocturnal readings.

Patients should be instructed to use a validated, automated oscillometric device that measures blood pressure in the brachial artery (upper arm) and to perform measurements in a quiet room after five minutes of rest in the seated position with the back and arm supported and legs uncrossed. At least 12 to 14 measurements should be obtained, with both morning and evening measurements taken, over a period of one week. Many patients require the use of a large cuff, usually sold separately. The mean of all available readings should be used for clinical decision-making.</p><p>Moderate-quality data suggest that blood pressure taken at home or work by the patient correlates more closely with the results of 24-hour or daytime ambulatory monitoring, with AOBPM, and with target-organ damage than usual blood pressure taken in the office.

Meeting one or more of these criteria using ABPM qualifies as hypertension (see <a href=\"#H7525347\" class=\"local\">'Definitions based upon ambulatory and home readings'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A 24-hour mean of <span class=\"nowrap\">125/75</span> mmHg or above</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Daytime (awake) mean of <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg or above</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nighttime (asleep) mean of <span class=\"nowrap\">110/65</span> mmHg or above</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We find the daytime (awake) average of <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;130/&ge;80</span> mmHg to be the most useful of these definitions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H675699133\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of blood pressure</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper technique and interpretation of the blood pressure is essential in the diagnosis and management of hypertension (see <a href=\"#H2606063649\" class=\"local\">'Blood pressure measurement'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A number of steps should ideally be followed to achieve maximum accuracy of office measurement. Rather than an auscultatory device (one that requires a stethoscope), we recommend using an automated oscillometric blood pressure device. Some automated devices can take multiple consecutive readings in the office with the patient sitting and resting alone (ie, unattended measurement). This technique, known as unattended automated office blood pressure monitoring (AOBPM), better predicts the results of ABPM than traditional office blood pressure measurement and may reduce the white coat effect. (See <a href=\"#H455612492\" class=\"local\">'Office-based blood pressure measurement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ABPM is the preferred method for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. High-quality data suggest that ABPM predicts target organ damage and cardiovascular events better than office blood pressure readings. (See <a href=\"#H3252602753\" class=\"local\">'Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To measure blood pressure at home, patients should be instructed to use a validated, automated oscillometric device that measures blood pressure in the brachial artery (upper arm) and to perform measurements in a quiet room after five minutes of rest in the seated position with the back and arm supported and legs uncrossed. At least 12 to 14 measurements should be obtained, with both morning and evening measurements taken, over a period of one week. (See <a href=\"#H748703714\" class=\"local\">'Home blood pressure monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539179052\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of hypertension</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an individual patient, we feel that making the diagnosis of hypertension requires the integration of multiple blood pressure readings, the use of appropriate technique, and also the use of measurements made outside of the usual office setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F105050\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105050 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Making the diagnosis of hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis can be made, without further confirmatory readings, in the following <strong>uncommon scenarios</strong>:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A patient who presents with hypertensive urgency or emergency (ie, patients with blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;180/&ge;120)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A patient who presents with an initial screening blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;160/&ge;100</span> mmHg and who also has known target end-organ damage (eg, left ventricular hypertension [LVH], hypertensive retinopathy, ischemic cardiovascular disease).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In <strong>all other patients</strong> who have an elevated office blood pressure, the diagnosis of hypertension should be confirmed using out-of-office blood pressure measurement whenever possible. ABPM is considered the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; in determining out-of-office blood pressure. However, many payers require evidence of normal out-of-office readings (suspected white coat hypertension) for reimbursement of ABPM. As such, we suggest home blood pressure measurement as the initial strategy to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension in most patients:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypertension is diagnosed if the mean home blood pressure, when measured with appropriate technique and with a device that has been validated in the office, is <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;130/&ge;80</span> mmHg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ABPM is an alternative to home blood pressure monitoring in settings where ABPM is readily available, particularly if adequate home blood pressures cannot be obtained, if there is doubt about the validity of home readings, or if there is a large discrepancy between office and home readings. When using ABPM, hypertension is diagnosed if the mean daytime blood pressure is <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;130/&ge;80</span> mmHg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Occasionally, out-of-office confirmation of hypertension is not possible because of issues with availability of equipment, insurance, and cost. In these situations, a diagnosis of hypertension can be confirmed by serial (at least three) office-based blood pressure measurements spaced over a period of weeks to months with a mean of <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;130/&ge;80</span> mmHg. While use of appropriate technique is important in all patients, it is particularly essential in those in whom the diagnosis of hypertension is based solely upon office readings. In settings where out-of-office blood pressure measurement is not readily available, we suggest using AOBPM.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3464065732\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of hypertension</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When hypertension is suspected based upon office readings or confirmed based upon out-of-office blood pressure readings, an evaluation should be performed to determine the following (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The extent of target-organ damage, if any</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The presence of established cardiovascular or renal disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The presence or absence of other cardiovascular risk factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lifestyle factors that could potentially contribute to hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Potential interfering substances (eg, chronic use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], oral contraceptives)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1400257978\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of hypertension</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifestyle modification should be prescribed to <strong>all patients</strong> with elevated blood pressure or hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62129\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62129 \">table 4</a>); however, not all patients diagnosed with hypertension require pharmacologic therapy.
