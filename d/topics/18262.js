CD comprises at least two distinct diseases (unicentric and multicentric) with very different prognoses. It is also associated with a number of malignancies, including Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and POEMS syndrome.</p><p>CD was first described in 1956 by Benjamin Castleman and colleagues, who identified a series of patients with solitary hyperplastic mediastinal lymph nodes containing small, hyalinized follicles and a marked interfollicular vascular proliferation (hyaline vascular variant of CD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The same investigators later identified lymph nodes with a similar vascular proliferation associated with large hyperplastic germinal centers and sheets of interfollicular plasma cells (plasma cell variant of CD). Hyalinized follicles were present in some, but not all, such cases. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All of the patients described in these early papers had localized disease, which is now termed unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD). UCD is associated with systemic symptoms in a subset of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) is a systemic disease with generalized peripheral lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, frequent fevers, and night sweats that is more frequently associated with the plasma cell variant. Unlike UCD, MCD is strongly associated with immunosuppression and HHV-8 infection.</p><p/><p>This topic review will discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical and pathologic features, diagnosis, and treatment of UCD. MCD and a review of diseases associated with HHV-8 infection and the virology of HHV-8 are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multicentric-castlemans-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multicentric Castleman's disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-associations-of-human-herpesvirus-8-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease associations of human herpesvirus 8 infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-epidemiology-and-transmission-of-human-herpesvirus-8-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology, epidemiology, and transmission of human herpesvirus 8 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3031617\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD) is poorly understood. The histopathologic features of lymph nodes from patients with Castleman's disease (CD), namely germinal center hyperplasia, the accumulation of immunoblasts and plasma cells, and increased vascularity, are best viewed as exaggerations of the types of reactive changes that can be seen in response to normal antigenic stimuli. Indeed, similar histologic changes are seen in other disorders associated with chronic immune activation, including autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and various congenital immunodeficiency states. (See <a href=\"#H3029492\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below.)</p><p>Both UCD and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) have been linked to excessive release of interleukin (IL)-6 or related polypeptides (eg, a homolog of IL-6 that is encoded in the HHV-8 genome). Early studies linked local production of IL-6 to the systemic manifestations of UCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], since lymph node excision resulted in relief of symptoms along with a decrease in IL-6 levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Moreover, waxing and waning of symptoms follows corresponding changes in IL-6 levels. The precise cells within the lymph node responsible for production of IL-6 have remained elusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; candidate cells include blastic B cells of the germinal centers, follicular dendritic cells, or cells present in the interfollicular regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition, IL-6 receptor polymorphisms have been identified in patients with HIV-negative CD and are associated with increased soluble IL-6 receptor levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Increased VEGF expression in interfollicular areas of lymph nodes and VEGF levels in serum have been observed in patients with CD. Increased VEGF expression is likely induced by IL-6 and may be responsible for the increased angiogenesis seen in tissues involved by CD. The pathogenesis of MCD is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multicentric-castlemans-disease#H6089332\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multicentric Castleman's disease&quot;, section on 'Role of interleukin-6'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3028894\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD) is rare, and there are no reliable estimates of its incidence in the population. While UCD can occur at any age, it is generally a disease of younger adults. The median age at presentation is approximately 35 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Most series demonstrate an approximately equal incidence in men and women.</p><p>Unlike multicentric Castleman's disease, UCD is not typically associated with HHV-8 infection or POEMS syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multicentric-castlemans-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multicentric Castleman's disease&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3028900\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89311174\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD) are commonly asymptomatic and come to clinical attention when an enlarged lymph node is noted on physical examination or imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. UCD usually affects one lymph node area. Systemic symptoms (ie, fever, night sweats, weight loss, malaise) are generally limited to patients with the less common plasma cell variant. In contrast, signs and symptoms related to the hyaline vascular variant are typically due to impingement and compression of neighboring structures (eg, airway, vessels) by the enlarging mass. </p><p>The lesions are generally moderate in size. The median lesion size in one review of 278 cases was 5.5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], with the most common sites of disease being the chest (24 percent), neck (20 percent), abdomen (18 percent), and retroperitoneum (14 percent). Less common sites included the axilla, groin, and pelvis. Solid organ involvement was uncommon and was most frequently seen in the parotid gland, where the disease may originate in intraparotid lymph nodes. In rare cases, UCD may be associated with hypoalbuminemia and high VEGF levels, peripheral edema, pleural effusion, and ascites. Although more commonly seen in multicentric CD, dermatologic manifestations may include rash, hemangiomata, and pemphigus. CD is also associated with autoimmune diseases including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and acquired factor VIII deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89311187\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory studies are usually normal in patients with the more common hyaline-vascular variant, although lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is elevated in a subset. In contrast, patients with the less common plasma cell variant often have laboratory abnormalities on presentation, which can include anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypoalbuminemia, elevated C-reactive protein and interleukin (IL)-6 levels, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Immunofixation should be performed to exclude a clonal plasma cell disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;, section on 'Serum immunofixation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3035205\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UCD may present as an asymptomatic finding on imaging. The most common radiologic presentation is that of an enhancing hypervascular mediastinal or hilar mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While the following features are suggestive of UCD, biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Computed tomography (CT)</strong> &ndash; CT usually demonstrates a well-circumscribed mass of soft tissue attenuation. Smaller masses typically have homogeneous enhancement following contrast, while larger masses have heterogeneous enhancement. Calcification is infrequent and, when present, the pattern of calcification is variable (punctate, coarse, peripheral, arborizing).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong> &ndash; MRI usually demonstrates a solid mass that is slightly increased on T1 compared with muscle and hyperintense on T2. There may be intralesional flow voids on T1 and T2 images (reflecting the vascularity of the lesion) and central linear hypointense septae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Positron emission tomography (PET)</strong> &ndash; Lesions are usually FDG-PET avid with an SUV lower than that typical of lymphoma. PET may identify involvement of nodes that are not increased in size.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3029492\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD) is characterized by nodal expansions that usually leave the structure of the underlying lymph node at least partially intact. B cells and plasma cells are polyclonal and T cells show no evidence of an aberrant immunophenotype. Three major variants are recognized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The hyaline vascular variant</strong> is characterized by the presence of abnormal follicles with atrophic or &quot;regressed&quot; germinal centers surrounded by prominent mantle zones containing small lymphocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90402\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90402 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Frequently, two or more closely adjacent atrophic germinal centers are encircled by a single mantle zone, a phenomenon referred to as germinal center &ldquo;twinning&rdquo;. The regressed germinal centers, which are often hyalinized, are depleted of lymphocytes and mainly consist of a prominent population of residual follicular dendritic cells. In the hyaline vascular variant, the dendritic cells express CD21, CD23, CD35, and epidermal growth factor receptor. The characteristic morphology is produced by these follicular dendritic cells, which are arranged in a concentric fashion that produces an &quot;onion-skin&quot; appearance. Sclerotic blood vessels are often seen penetrating the atrophic germinal centers, producing so-called &quot;lollipop lesions&quot;. Sinuses are typically obliterated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/1,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6</a>]. The interfollicular lymphoid tissue contains numerous small blood vessels known as high endothelial venules that are lined by plump, activated endothelial cells. Tight aggregates of plasmacytoid dendritic cells may also be appreciated in interfollicular regions, particularly with immunohistochemical stains for CD123, but these cells are not sufficiently specific to be of diagnostic utility. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The HHV8-negative plasma cell variant</strong> has hyperplastic B cell follicles (germinal centers) and often some regressed or &quot;hyaline vascular&quot; follicles as well; the interfollicular region is hypervascular and contains sheets of plasma cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90404\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90404 \">picture 2</a>). The germinal centers have typical reactive features, including polarization into light and dark zones, frequent mitotic figures, and numerous macrophages containing apoptotic debris (tingible body macrophages). Sinuses may be patent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HHV8-positive plasma cell variant</strong> is characterized by the preservation of nodal architecture and increased numbers of follicles that vary from hyperplastic to regressed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90403\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90403 \">picture 3</a>). The interfollicular region contains proliferating blood vessels and mature plasma cells, similar to the HHV8 negative plasma cell type. In contrast to the localized HHV8-negative plasma cell variant, in HHV8+ CD, increased numbers of immunoblasts (called plasmablasts in some reports) are present in the outer mantle zones of the hyperplastic follicles and sometimes in the germinal centers as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. These cells may coalesce to form so-called &quot;microlymphomas&quot;, a controversial term that has been used by some to describe the accumulation of plasmablasts that are monotypic with respect to immunoglobulin light chain expression, yet polyclonal when evaluated for immunoglobulin gene rearrangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], a highly unusual combination of findings. In most cases with these morphologic features, frank HHV8+ plasmablastic B cell lymphoma eventually develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the HHV8+ plasma cell variant, HHV-8 can be demonstrated using monoclonal antibodies specific for viral proteins. </p><p/><p>Approximately 10 to 20 percent of UCD are of the plasma cell variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], while a small percent have a mixed histologic appearance with features of both the hyaline vascular and plasma cell subtypes. The mantle zone lymphocytes in both categories of CD are polyclonal IgM or IgD-expressing cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The plasma cells in the interfollicular areas are generally also polyclonal. Localized clonal expansions are sometimes seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>], but do not appear to affect prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/15,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3031444\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD) are commonly asymptomatic and are brought to clinical attention when an enlarged lymph node is noted on physical examination or imaging studies. UCD should be suspected in the setting of a single persistently enlarged mass (usually nodal) associated with moderate to intense post-contrast enhancement on computed tomography. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) should establish that the disease is limited to a single site with a relatively lower standardized uptake value (SUV). The diagnosis is confirmed upon pathologic review of a biopsy of involved tissue, typically an excisional biopsy of a lymph node. </p><p>Biopsy demonstrates polyclonal nodal expansions that usually leave the structure of the underlying lymph node at least partially intact, and histologic features that are consistent with the hyaline vascular or plasma cell variants, as described above. Other disorders that can be associated with hyperplastic lymph nodes containing increased numbers of plasma cells, such as rheumatoid arthritis, other connective tissue diseases, HIV infection, and multicentric Castleman's disease, may need to be excluded in patients with systemic symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3031451\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD) includes other disorders that can present with an enlarged lymph node and depends, in part, upon the morphologic variant. As a general rule, it is unusual for other causes of reactive lymphadenopathy to present with isolated lymph node enlargement, or to result in lymph node enlargement to sizes greater than 2 to 3 cm, clues that can be helpful when the histologic appearance raises the possibility of UCD.</p><p>The differential diagnosis for the more common hyaline vascular variant includes <em>Toxoplasma</em> lymphadenitis, burned-out HIV lymphadenitis, follicular hyperplasia of any cause, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes with nodular growth patterns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>Toxoplasma</em></strong><strong> lymphadenitis</strong> &ndash; In <em>Toxoplasma</em> lymphadenitis, the lymph nodes have large reactive follicles with well-developed germinal centers that are infiltrated by clusters of epithelioid histiocytes, as well as interfollicular collections of monocytoid B cells. Atrophic follicles are usually absent. Peripheral lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal) are most commonly affected, which are unusual locations for UCD. Serologic studies can usually confirm the diagnosis of <em>Toxoplasma</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent hosts&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HIV lymphadenitis</strong> &ndash; Generalized lymphadenopathy is common in primary HIV. The nodes decrease in size following the acute presentation, but a modest degree of adenopathy often persists. These lymph nodes may demonstrate involuted follicles with hyalinized germinal centers and interfollicular vascular proliferation that mimics hyaline vascular CD. Unlike in CD, clusters of plasmacytoid dendritic cells are not prominent. Serologic studies would confirm HIV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Follicular hyperplasia</strong> &ndash; In reactive follicular hyperplasia, histology shows discrete follicles of varying sizes and shapes that are separated from one another by interfollicular regions rich in T cells within the lymph node cortex. The follicles are polarized with well-formed light and dark zones and contain tingible body macrophages and mitotic figures. Sinuses are intact and may be distended. In contrast, the sinuses in CD are usually absent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphoma</strong> &ndash; Non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes that may mimic the hyaline vascular variant of CD include follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and nodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma. All of these lymphoma variants have immunophenotypic features that differ from CD and express monoclonal immunoglobulin, whereas CD is typically polyclonal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and prognosis of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p>The differential diagnosis for the plasma cell variant includes rheumatoid arthritis, plasmacytoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes with prominent plasma cells:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis</strong> &ndash; The lymph nodes of patients with untreated rheumatoid arthritis may have marked interfollicular plasmacytosis and reactive follicular hyperplasia that can mimic the plasma cell variant of CD. CD is suggested by the presence of a subset of follicles with hyaline vascular changes. A positive serum rheumatoid factor supports a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, while positive immunohistochemical staining for HHV-8 supports a diagnosis of CD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H8594876\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plasmacytoma</strong> &ndash; Both plasmacytoma and the plasma cell variant of CD can demonstrate sheets of plasma cells. In plasmacytoma, these sheets are comprised of atypical monoclonal plasma cells that efface the normal lymph node architecture. In contrast, in CD the plasma cells are typically polyclonal and are found in a richly vascular interfollicular region, and lymph node follicles are retained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-extramedullary-plasmacytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphoma </strong>&ndash; Non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes that may mimic the plasma cell variant of CD include lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, marginal B cell lymphomas, and angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma. Unlike in CD, these neoplasms typically efface the normal lymphoid structure and demonstrate clonality. While CD is typically polyclonal, a subset of plasma cell variant CD associated with HHV-8 is associated with an expansion of polyclonal plasmablasts expressing lambda immunoglobulin light chains; as a result, such variants are monotypic by immunohistochemistry, yet polyclonal by IgH gene rearrangements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28919244\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the diagnosis of unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD) has been confirmed by pathologic evaluation of the involved lymph node, a pretreatment evaluation provides a baseline of disease activity and assessment of comorbidities that may impact treatment options (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F93417\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93417 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3028906\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data regarding the treatment of unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD) come from systematic reviews of the literature, case series, and case reports. Given the rarity of the condition, there have been no randomized trials. Complete resection (eg, resective or debulking surgery) of the involved node is curative and has been considered the gold standard approach for the treatment of UCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Very rare anecdotal reports of recurrence are usually related to incomplete initial resection or missed lymph nodes at the initial evaluation. Systemic symptoms and laboratory abnormalities, if present, also resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/6,11,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,20-23</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of the literature identified 278 patients with UCD who had undergone complete resection (94 percent) or diagnostic biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Disease-free survival rates at three and five years were 90 and 81 percent, respectively. Outcomes were significantly better for those who had undergone complete resection. Complete resection was the only significant predictor of mortality (4 versus 18 percent for those who had undergone complete resection and diagnostic biopsy, respectively). </p><p>Occasionally, a large UCD mass may be unresectable due to size or, more often, location. This is frequently encountered in the setting of a mediastinal mass that is very close to a main bronchus or major blood vessels. In these patients, we proceed with initial debulking of the mass with systemic therapy, as described for multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD), followed by safer surgical intervention. As an example, a case report described the successful use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in a single patient with recurrent chest pain due to an unresectable tumor mass encompassing the right main pulmonary artery and main bronchus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Other interventions using antibodies targeting IL-6 can also be considered as in MCD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multicentric-castlemans-disease#H457700\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multicentric Castleman's disease&quot;, section on 'Inhibition of interleukin-6'</a>.)</p><p>Systemic steroids can provide symptomatic relief but do not predictably reduce tumor size. Similarly, radiation therapy has been utilized, but with very limited response. Radiation treatment with approximately 30 to 45 Gy can result in complete and partial remission rates of 40 and 10 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Importantly, radiation-induced fibrosis may make subsequent surgical intervention more difficult limiting its use in general practice. </p><p>In patients whose lesions cannot be completely resected, outcomes remain favorable. Partially resected masses may remain stable and asymptomatic for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/6,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21,22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3035212\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99619779\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After completion of the initially planned treatment, patients should be evaluated to determine the disease response to treatment and should be followed longitudinally for relapse and complications. One month following the completion of planned therapy, the response to treatment should be documented by history, physical examination, and laboratory studies (complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, biochemical profile, IL-6, C-reactive protein, serum free light chain assay, and quantitative immunoglobulins). The post-treatment imaging study of choice is the positron emission <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/computed</span> tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span> scan, which provides information on the size and activity of residual masses. Following excision, patients are followed annually with <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> and serum biomarkers, which include IL-6, C-reactive protein, serum free light chain assay, and quantitative immunoglobulins. Annual imaging can be discontinued after five years if the patient remains disease free.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3028912\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD) will experience long-term disease-free survival following complete resection. Death due to UCD is rare, with a systematic review of 278 cases of UCD reporting a 4 percent mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The only significant predictor of survival was complete resection of the lesion.</p><p>UCD may be associated with an increased risk of lymphoma. Of 48 reported cases of UCD in one series, three developed B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), one developed Hodgkin lymphoma, and two others amyloidosis, despite complete resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/11,20-23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20-23,25</a>]. Another series of eight cases of UCD associated with NHL has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The two diagnoses were concurrent in three, with a mean interval of 46 months between the diagnosis of UCD and the subsequent NHL. Also in this series was a case of Hodgkin lymphoma with UCD-like histologic changes in the same lymph node. It is unclear whether these cases represent a true malignant transformation or presence of lymphoma at the initial diagnosis of CD that was not detected. Initial evaluation of the lymph node biopsy with molecular studies for IgH gene rearrangement is recommended to rule out the latter.</p><p>Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is an often fatal paraneoplastic mucocutaneous blistering disease that is most commonly induced by lymphoproliferative disorders. Approximately 15 percent of instances of paraneoplastic pemphigus are associated with UCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Resection of the tumor often results in remission of the pemphigus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-pemphigus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic pemphigus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3029239\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Castleman's disease (CD, angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a heterogenous group of rare lymphoproliferative disorders associated in a subset of cases with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). CD comprises at least two distinct diseases (unicentric and multicentric) with very different prognoses. Both conditions can be associated with development of malignancies, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. (See <a href=\"#H3028912\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD) is most often an isolated lymphoproliferative disorder of young adults. Patients are commonly asymptomatic and are brought to clinical attention when an enlarged lymph node is noted on physical examination or imaging studies. The vast majority of lesions are in the mediastinum and lung. Peripheral lymphadenopathy is unusual, and laboratory and clinical abnormalities are seen in less than 25 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"#H89311174\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>UCD should be suspected in the setting of a single persistently enlarged mass (usually nodal) associated with moderate to intense post-contrast enhancement on computed tomography. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) should establish that the disease is limited to a single site. (See <a href=\"#H3035205\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is confirmed upon pathologic review of a biopsy of involved tissue, typically an excisional biopsy of a lymph node. Biopsy demonstrates polyclonal nodal expansions that usually leave the structure of the underlying lymph node at least partially intact. Histologic features are consistent with the hyaline vascular or plasma cell variants. (See <a href=\"#H3029492\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of UCD includes other disorders that can present with an enlarged lymph node and depends, in part, upon the morphologic variant. Other disorders that can be associated with hyperplastic lymph nodes containing increased numbers of plasma cells, such as rheumatoid arthritis and other connective tissue diseases, must be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H3031451\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, we recommend complete resection of the involved node rather than simple biopsy or incomplete resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Such treatment is universally curative. If the involved node cannot be completely removed because of its anatomic location, we proceed with systemic therapy to reduce mass size followed by surgical resection. Localized radiation therapy has a relatively limited role. (See <a href=\"#H3028906\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After completion of the initially planned treatment, patients should be evaluated to determine the disease response to treatment and should be followed longitudinally for relapse and complications. Follow-up generally includes annual imaging and laboratory studies. (See <a href=\"#H3035212\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">CASTLEMAN B, IVERSON L, MENENDEZ VP.
