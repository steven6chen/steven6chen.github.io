While HCV infection is estimated to account for 15 percent of symptomatic cases of acute hepatitis in the United States, the majority of patients with acute HCV go undetected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. This is due in large part to the fact that patients with acute HCV are typically asymptomatic. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that there were 33,900 new HCV infections in 2015, of which only 2436 cases were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This reflects a nearly three-fold increase in the incidence of HCV infection over a five-year period, which parallels the rising rates of injection drug use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116122\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116122 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>This topic will review acute HCV in adults.

Symptomatic patients may experience jaundice, nausea, dark urine, and right upper quadrant pain. Patients with acute HCV infection typically have moderate to high serum aminotransferase elevations (see <a href=\"#H164593372\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> below).

In a review that included five studies from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Study of Transfusion-Associated Non-A, Non-B, and Type C Hepatitis, more than two-thirds of patients with acute HCV were asymptomatic during the acute episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Among those patients presenting with symptomatic acute HCV infection, jaundice is commonly reported. In a study that included 51 patients with symptomatic acute HCV, patients reported jaundice (68 percent), dark urine and white stool (39 percent), nausea (34 percent), and abdominal pain (25 percent, predominantly right upper quadrant pain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Additional symptoms reported in other studies include fatigue, low-grade fever and chills, loss of appetite, pruritus, muscle aches, mood disturbances, joint pain, dyspepsia, and confusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Fulminant hepatic failure due to acute HCV infection is very rare but may be more common in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis B virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Conversely, spontaneous clearance of acute HCV infection is also more common in people with underlying current or past hepatitis B virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In one of the largest series that included 259 patients with acute HCV, the mean alanine aminotransferase was 1174 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> with a range of 5 to 5185 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">microkat/L,</span> range 0.09 to 88 <span class=\"nowrap\">microkat/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. During the course of acute infection, aminotransferase levels can vary widely within short time intervals, in contrast to chronic infection, during which they are often elevated but relatively stable over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/10,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18,19</a>]. </p><p>Among patients who develop symptoms, the aminotransferases start to increase shortly before the onset of clinical symptoms and usually before anti-HCV antibodies are detectable. However, since the levels often fluctuate (sometimes quite widely) and may even normalize, not all patients will have elevated aminotransferase levels at the time of presentation. Normalization of the serum aminotransferase concentrations after acute infection does not necessarily mean that the infection has cleared.</p><p>Patients with acute HCV infection may also have elevated total bilirubin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/10,16,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16,20,21</a>]. In the study of 259 patients, 51 percent had a bilirubin level above 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (51 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a second study with 28 patients with acute HCV, the mean bilirubin concentration was 4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (75 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the setting of undetectable anti-HCV antibodies that subsequently become detectable within 12 weeks is generally considered definitive proof of acute HCV infection. Alternately, newly detectable HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibodies with documentation of negative tests within the prior six months is also diagnostic of acute HCV infection. In the absence of such documentation, the distinction between acute HCV infection and newly discovered chronic infection is not straightforward, since in both settings patients may have detectable HCV RNA, HCV antibodies, and elevated serum aminotransferases. </p><p>Diagnosing acute HCV infection is important as spontaneous clearance can still occur, treatment regimens differ from those in chronic infection, and a careful history can identify risk factors for ongoing transmission. The approach to diagnosis of acute HCV infection differs slightly depending on the clinical presentation, whether the patient presents with acute hepatitis or with a distinct HCV exposure. This is discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H936453010\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute HCV infection should be suspected in patients with clinical manifestations of acute hepatitis or with possible recent exposure to HCV (eg, needle-stick injury, recent injection drug use). Such patients should be tested for the presence of HCV RNA and antibodies in the serum. The timing of testing is influenced by when HCV RNA and antibodies become detectable in the blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68723\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68723 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60223\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60223 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H936453016\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with acute hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a patient presenting for the first time with acute hepatitis (eg, elevated transaminases <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> jaundice), we immediately obtain HCV RNA by PCR and anti-HCV antibody testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101863\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101863 \">algorithm 1</a>). Establishing the diagnosis of acute hepatitis C or the need for further testing for acute HCV depends on results of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HCV RNA negative </strong>&ndash; Acute HCV infection is unlikely. Typically, HCV RNA is detectable by the time a patient has symptoms. If the HCV antibody is positive at this time point but the HCV RNA is negative, that is suggestive of a prior, cleared HCV infection, and this should be confirmed with repeat HCV RNA after 12 weeks. Follow-up confirmatory HCV RNA testing in this situation is important since HCV RNA levels can fluctuate widely during acute HCV infection and may even become transiently undetectable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HCV RNA positive and HCV antibody negative</strong> &ndash; Acute HCV infection is likely. We then recheck HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibody in 12 weeks (or a total of 12 weeks following a known or presumed exposure). Most patients will develop anti-HCV antibodies by 12 weeks after exposure, and it is preferable to make a diagnosis as soon as possible to help guide management. A positive anti-HCV result at this subsequent time point confirms seroconversion and acute HCV infection. Persistently detectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks indicates a high risk for subsequent chronic infection, whereas a negative HCV RNA suggests spontaneous viral clearance, which requires confirmation with repeat HCV RNA testing after another 12 weeks. (See <a href=\"#H164590471\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for viral clearance'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HCV RNA positive and HCV antibody positive</strong> &ndash; This pattern confirms HCV infection, but in isolation, cannot distinguish between acute and chronic infection. If there is documentation of a serum sample within the prior six months with negative HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibody, then acute HCV infection is diagnosed. Similarly, if there is documentation of a recent negative HCV RNA following treatment or spontaneous clearance of a prior HCV infection, acute reinfection is likely. In the absence of such documentation, the distinction between acute HCV infection and newly discovered chronic infection is not straightforward since, in both settings, patients may have detectable HCV RNA, anti-HCV antibodies, and elevated serum aminotransferases. In some cases, there is suggestive circumstantial evidence for new infection, such as a history of a recent high-risk exposure, new clinical features of acute hepatitis, consistently normal aminotransferase levels on prior testing, and absence of risk factors for HCV infection in the past. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Repeat HCV RNA testing (eg, at least six weeks later) might help to distinguish acute from chronic infection in this setting. Fluctuating low levels of HCV RNA are suggestive of acute HCV, whereas higher HCV levels that do not fluctuate are suggestive of chronic infection. As an example, in one report, low HCV RNA levels (&lt;10<sup>5</sup> international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> were seen in 17 of 21 patients with acute HCV (81 percent) compared with 81 of 623 patients with chronic HCV (13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Viral load fluctuations during a 10-week period among those with acute HCV were &gt;1 log in 18 patients (86 percent). In contrast, other studies have found that viral load fluctuations in chronic infection tend to be less than 1 log international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> over many years of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H349503631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Viral levels'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, aminotransferase levels fluctuate more widely in acute than chronic HCV infection. Markedly elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in a patient with newly diagnosed HCV infection should raise suspicion for acute infection, particularly if history reveals recent risk exposures. Although there is no clearly defined threshold, we explore the possibility of acute HCV infection in patients with ALT levels above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> with no other explanation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Finally, evidence of hepatic fibrosis can suggest chronic rather than acute infection, although this can be misleading if the patient has other potential causes of liver disease (such as heavy alcohol use). Fibrosis assessment is not needed to establish the diagnosis of HCV infection, but it can help differentiate acute from chronic HCV in cases where there is doubt. Noninvasive measures of fibrosis can be used instead of biopsy; however, the marked inflammation that can occur during acute HCV infection can falsely elevate fibrosis scores with transient elastography or serum panels that include aminotransferases (eg, APRI (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-aspartate-aminotransferase-ast-to-platelet-ratio-index-apri\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>)or FIB-4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cirrhosis-probability-in-hepatitis-c-fib-4-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) calculations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H164590471\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for viral clearance'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to diagnostic testing for acute HCV infection, evaluation of patients presenting with acute hepatitis includes testing for other causes (eg, hepatitis B virus infection, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatotoxicity). This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests#H19404948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;, section on 'Elevated serum aminotransferases'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H936453022\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with discrete HCV exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a patient presenting following a known, discrete exposure to HCV, we first obtain tests for HCV RNA, HCV Ab, and serum aminotransferases to establish the baseline HCV status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101864\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101864 \">algorithm 2</a>). Within one to two days following an exposure, a patient without prior infection should have negative HCV RNA, negative HCV Ab, and normal aminotransferases. Thus, this baseline HCV status can be used to document subsequent new seroconversion (if the exposure leads to infection) or to establish previously undiagnosed chronic HCV infection. Further testing depends on the results of the HCV RNA test:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Negative baseline HCV RNA </strong>&ndash; Individuals who have negative HCV RNA at baseline are at risk for new HCV infection following an exposure. In such patients, we repeat testing to monitor for HCV infection: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Four weeks after exposure: HCV RNA and serum aminotransferases (anti-HCV antibody is not expected to be detectable at this time if it was negative at baseline)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Three to four months after exposure: HCV RNA, anti-HCV antibody (if not previously positive), and serum aminotransferases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Six months after exposure: HCV RNA, anti-HCV antibody (if not previously positive)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Elevated aminotransferases at the above time points would be a trigger to check HCV RNA sooner if not already detectable. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that, following an exposure, health care personnel who have negative baseline HCV testing be tested with HCV RNA at least three weeks later, and that no further testing is needed if the RNA test is negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, because HCV RNA levels can fluctuate widely in acute infection, we favor a more conservative approach of repeat testing, as above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the HCV RNA becomes detectable at one of the time points above, acute HCV infection is diagnosed. We then recheck anti-HCV antibody (if not already detected at one of these time points) 12 weeks later to confirm seroconversion and acute HCV. For such patients, we also repeat HCV RNA testing to evaluate for spontaneous clearance. (See <a href=\"#H164590471\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for viral clearance'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who have a baseline positive anti-HCV antibody (suggestive of prior spontaneously cleared or treated HCV infection), if HCV RNA remains negative throughout the testing period outlined above, HCV reinfection has not occurred, and testing can be stopped. If there is ongoing risk of exposure (eg, continued injection drug use or sexual exposure, particularly HIV-positive men who have sex with men), repeated screening for reinfection can be performed with HCV RNA testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H285050178\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Screening frequency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who had a baseline negative anti-HCV antibody, if HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibody remain negative during the testing period, then HCV infection has not occurred, and testing can be stopped. In some cases, the anti-HCV antibody becomes reactive over time but the HCV RNA remains undetectable. This suggests acute HCV infection with spontaneous clearance and is confirmed when HCV RNA remains negative over 12 weeks and for at least six months after exposure. In rare instances, anti-HCV antibody may not become detectable after an acute infection, either because of a low inoculum with spontaneous clearance or an immunocompromising condition (eg, advanced HIV infection or hemodialysis), even if chronic infection ensues. With the newest generation HCV antibody assays, however, false-negative results are rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These recommendations for postexposure testing are generally similar to those suggested by the joint American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) HCV guidelines and the National Institutes of Health, with slight differences in testing intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/5,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection among healthcare providers&quot;</a>). Pre-exposure or postexposure prophylaxis or treatment is not recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Detectable baseline HCV RNA</strong> &ndash; Individuals with a detectable HCV RNA are HCV infected. If the anti-HCV antibody is also positive, this likely indicates preexisting chronic infection, although it can also represent an acute reinfection after prior spontaneous clearance or successful treatment. Aside from history, the level of ALT and other features mentioned above can help distinguish preexisting chronic infection from an acute reinfection. If the anti-HCV antibody is negative with a detectable baseline HCV RNA, this suggests acute HCV infection, particularly if the exposure was more than a few days prior. In such cases, we recheck the anti-HCV antibody at 12 weeks to confirm seroconversion and repeat HCV RNA testing to evaluate for spontaneous clearance. A small proportion of immunocompromised individuals (eg, those with advanced HIV infection or on hemodialysis) may not develop antibodies; however, this is rare with the newest generation HCV antibody tests.

In a series of 14 needle-stick injuries, a negative HCV PCR at two weeks postexposure had a high negative predictive value (100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Symptoms are thought to reflect a more robust immune response targeting the virus, which leads to more rapid HCV RNA decline and increases the likelihood of clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/19,36,46,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,36,46,55</a>].</p><p>Other factors consistently associated with a higher chance of spontaneous clearance include younger age at acquisition, female sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/45,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,56</a>], genotype 1 (versus non-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]), and polymorphisms in the interferon-lambda 4 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/45,46,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46,56-58</a>].

Those who have previously had spontaneous clearance are more likely to have clearance again upon reinfection, but clearance of chronic infection following successful treatment does not appear to influence the risk of spontaneous clearance following reinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/56,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,60</a>].</p><p>The wide variability in estimated clearance rates across studies may be due, in part, to the study methodology used. Because antibody titers wane over time and may eventually disappear, spontaneous clearance rates may be underestimated by population-based studies that use the prevalence of anti-HCV antibody positivity and HCV PCR negativity in untreated patients to identify clearance. Consistent with this explanation, prospective studies consistently report higher clearance rates than retrospective population-based studies. In addition, for those with ongoing risk factors, such as continued injection drug use, some episodes of spontaneous clearance may be missed if reinfection occurs in between testing intervals. This may, in part, explain the relatively low rates of clearance (20 percent or less) among people who use injection drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/50,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,61,62</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H936455605\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of viral clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who are destined to spontaneously clear HCV viremia do so within 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19</a>]. As an example, in a study of 27 patients with acute HCV infection who were not receiving treatment, 8 patients (30 percent) spontaneously cleared the virus, 88 percent of whom did so before week 12 (with the final patient doing so at week 14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

Although the antibody to HCV is not protective against reinfection, reinfection after spontaneous clearance is associated with a shorter duration and lower peak of viremia and a higher chance of spontaneous clearance, suggesting a degree of protective immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>Once chronic infection ensues, typically an average of six months after exposure, spontaneous clearance is very infrequent.

The European Association for the Study of the Liver recommends treatment of acute HCV infection with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir</a> plus a nonstructural 5A protein (NS5A) inhibitor for eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The joint American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidance recommends waiting six months to evaluate for spontaneous clearance and to treat those with persistent viremia with regimens recommended for chronic HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Our approach to deciding whom to treat and regimen selection during acute HCV infection is discussed in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58732302\"><span class=\"h3\">Whom to treat during acute infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the availability of direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based regimens for HCV treatment, there was impetus to treat patients within the first few months of infection since the efficacy of interferon-based regimens during acute infection (with cure rates &gt;90 percent) was greater than during chronic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The high efficacy rates of newer DAA-based regimens for chronic HCV infection (cure rates &gt;95 percent) reduce this efficacy benefit of treating early, and so there is little rationale to use interferon-based therapy in acute infection given that it is poorly tolerated. Although shorter DAA regimens than those typically used in chronic infection might be effective for acute infection, optimal regimens have not yet been established. Thus, for most patients, it is appropriate to defer antiviral treatment during the first few months of infection and wait until they have documented persistent HCV viremia six or more months following presumed or known exposure. At that point, patients can be considered to have chronic HCV infection and can be treated as such with DAA combination regimens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p>This approach may not be acceptable to patients and does not address the risk of ongoing transmission if the recently infected individual continues to engage in high-risk activities. Thus, treating during acute HCV infection (ie, prior to six months after diagnosis or exposure), even with an interferon-containing regimen, may be preferable for certain circumstances. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals who will have limited access or contraindications to all-oral DAA regimens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals at risk of complications with acute HCV infection (eg, those with underlying liver disease or a severe presentation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals at high risk of transmission (eg, people who inject drugs, HIV-infected MSM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals who desire and are committed to early treatment</p><p/><p>The decision to treat during acute HCV infection in such individuals depends on the risk of waiting until chronicity to treat and the available treatment options. As an example, for genotypes 1 and 4 infection, there are emerging data suggesting good outcomes in acute HCV infection with shorter courses of DAA combination therapy than typically used in chronic infection. Thus, for these genotypes, we are more likely to suggest treatment in the acute setting with these abbreviated regimens, acknowledging that data are still preliminary. By contrast, for other genotypes, optimal short-course DAA regimens have not yet been defined, and we are thus more likely to wait and treat promptly once viremia has been documented at six months, as above. </p><p>Regardless of treatment decisions, patients with acute HCV should undergo HCV RNA monitoring to determine the outcome of infection (spontaneous clearance versus chronic infection).

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients who are acutely infected with HCV are asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients may experience jaundice, nausea, dark urine, and right upper quadrant pain, with a mean onset of symptoms at seven to eight weeks after infection. Patients with acute HCV infection typically have moderate to high serum aminotransferase elevations. (See <a href=\"#H495128408\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detectable HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the setting of undetectable anti-HCV antibodies that subsequently become detectable within 12 weeks is generally considered definitive proof of acute HCV infection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternately, newly detectable HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibodies with documentation of negative tests within the prior six months is also suggestive of acute HCV infection. In the absence of such documentation, the distinction between acute HCV infection and newly discovered chronic infection is not straightforward, since in both settings, patients may have detectable HCV RNA, HCV antibodies, and elevated serum aminotransferases. A history of exposure, fluctuating viral levels, and the height of the alanine transaminase level can help distinguish acute from chronic infection. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute HCV infection should be suspected in patients with clinical manifestations of an acute hepatitis syndrome (eg, elevated transaminases <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> jaundice) or with possible recent exposure to HCV (eg, from a needle-stick or injection drug use).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For a patient presenting for the first time with acute hepatitis possibly due to HCV exposure, we immediately obtain HCV RNA by PCR and anti-HCV antibody testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Establishing the diagnosis of acute hepatitis C or the need for further testing for acute HCV depends on results of these tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101863\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101863 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H936453016\" class=\"local\">'Patients with acute hepatitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For a patient presenting following a known, potential exposure to HCV, we first obtain tests for HCV RNA, HCV Ab, and serum aminotransferases to establish the baseline HCV status. Among those who are uninfected at baseline, we recheck these tests intermittently (at least after three and six months) to evaluate for new HCV infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101864\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101864 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H936453022\" class=\"local\">'Patients with discrete HCV exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients acutely infected with HCV either spontaneously clear the virus or go on to develop chronic infection. Estimates of the frequency of spontaneous viral clearance vary from 14 to 50 percent. Most patients who are destined to spontaneously clear HCV viremia do so within 12 weeks, although clearance after longer follow-up (as long as one year) has been described. Once acute HCV infection has been diagnosed, HCV RNA should be retested at least after three and six months to determine the outcome of infection. (See <a href=\"#H164590471\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for viral clearance'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, we suggest deferring antiviral treatment during the first few months of infection and waiting until they have documented persistent HCV viremia six or more months following presumed or known exposure, at which point they can be treated for chronic HCV infection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Treating within the first six months of HCV infection may be preferable for the following patients:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals who will have limited access or contraindications to all-oral DAA regimens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals at risk of complications with acute HCV infection (eg, those with underlying liver disease or a severe presentation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals at high risk of transmission (eg, people who inject drugs, HIV-infected men who have sex with men)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals who desire and are committed to early treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom the decision has been made to treat during acute infection, regimen selection depends on genotype. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with genotype 1 or 4 infection, we suggest sofosbuvir-ledipasvir (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We treat for six weeks for most patients; if the baseline HCV RNA level &gt;7 log international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> we extend therapy to 12 weeks. (See <a href=\"#H936454898\" class=\"local\">'Regimen selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with genotypes 2, 3, 5, or 6 infection, we suggest one of the genotype-appropriate direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens that are used for chronic infection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-2-and-3-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 2 and 3 infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-4-5-and-6-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 4, 5, and 6 infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend reserving interferon-based therapy for individuals who are in locations where DAA regimens are not available at all or who have a pressing indication for earlier treatment but cannot access DAA regimens for acute infection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H79210547\" class=\"local\">'Interferon-based regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virologic response to treatment is assessed by checking the viral load at 12 weeks following the cessation of therapy. Patients who achieve spontaneous viral clearance or sustained virologic response after treatment should be aware that they remain at risk of reinfection if they are again exposed to HCV.
