Chronic PVT develops in patients with acute PVT that does not resolve (with or without treatment). Patients with chronic PVT develop collateral blood vessels that bring blood in a hepatopetal manner around the area of obstruction, known as cavernous transformation of the portal vein or portal cavernoma. When seen in a transverse section, as on a computed tomographic (CT) scan, cavernous transformation gives the appearance of multiple caveolar orifices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51167\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51167 \">image 1</a>).

Patients with chronic PVT may also develop intestinal ischemia and infarction if there is extension of the clot into the superior mesenteric vein, though the risk is small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In a retrospective series that included 40 patients with chronic PVT, at the time of diagnosis, esophageal varices were present in 35 patients (88 percent), gastric varices in 20 patients (50 percent), portal hypertensive gastropathy in 19 patients (48 percent), and gastrointestinal bleeding in 19 patients (48 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Portal cholangiopathy (also referred to as portal biliopathy) is also common in patients with longstanding chronic PVT and is due to compression of the large bile ducts by the venous collaterals that form in patients with chronic PVT. Studies using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography have found evidence of portal cholangiopathy in the majority of patients with long-standing chronic PVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Two had obstructive jaundice, and one had cholangitis. In a second series, 5 of 23 patients were found to have choledocholithiasis, but all were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Among patients who are symptomatic, gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common clinical presentation. Patients with gastrointestinal bleeding typically report hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. Patients may also have symptoms related to portal cholangiopathy or intestinal ischemia. Symptoms seen with portal cholangiopathy include jaundice, pruritus, or biliary colic; the presence of jaundice, abdominal pain, and fever is suggestive of cholangitis. If intestinal ischemia or infarction develops, patients may report abdominal pain that radiates to the back, abdominal distension from ascites, or bloody diarrhea.

The mechanism behind splenomegaly is not fully understood, but it may be related to increased venous congestion and splenic arterial flow. The degree of splenomegaly in patients with chronic PVT is often greater than is seen in those with cirrhosis, and massive splenomegaly may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A small amount of ascites is seen in 10 to 20 percent of patients with chronic PVT who do not have cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>], particularly after gastrointestinal bleeding with massive fluid resuscitation, which may lead to acute dilutional hypoalbuminemia.

Patients may also have findings associated with hypersplenism such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. In patients with portal cholangiopathy, laboratory testing may reveal a cholestatic pattern of laboratory test abnormalities (eg, elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin).

Our approach is to start with abdominal ultrasound with Doppler imaging, followed by a computed tomographic (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm the diagnosis and to look for predisposing conditions, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. We start with Doppler ultrasound because it is inexpensive and can identify biliary pathology that may lead to abdominal pain. It is reasonable to start with a CT or MRI if suspicion for chronic PVT is high or if there is generalized abdominal pain, in which case the differential diagnosis is large. </p><p>Patients should also undergo a serologic evaluation for potential predisposing conditions. While it is our practice to do a hypercoagulability workup in all patients with PVT, including those with decompensated cirrhosis, others would not perform the evaluation in patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to re-balanced coagulation pathways, which can tilt from a hypercoagulable to hypocoagulable state and which are not due to a pre-existing condition &#160; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults#H417347105\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of portal vein thrombosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403444\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler imaging in a patient with chronic PVT demonstrates hyperechoic material within the portal vein that may extend into the mesenteric or splenic veins, dilation of the portal vein and its tributaries, and absence of flow within the portal vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Ultrasonography may also reveal a mass of tortuous vessels at the porta hepatis or within the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The velocity of blood flow within those vessels is usually less than that in a normal portal vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403451\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An abdominal CT scan in a patient with chronic PVT reveals a network of intertwined, densely packed veins in the hepatoduodenal ligament and porta hepatis.

In those with decompensated cirrhosis, the decision to pursue a work up for a genetic basis for hypercoagulability should be individualized. We often reserve it for recurrent thrombotic events or if thrombosis occurs in more than one vascular bed or if there is a family history of thrombotic disorders. The approach to the evaluation of patients with established venous thrombosis is discussed in detail elsewhere.

In such patients, we suggest long-term anticoagulation. We only give anticoagulation to patients with a history of gastrointestinal variceal bleeding or large varices who are at increased risk for bleeding (particularly in those with cirrhosis) if adequate prophylactic measures to prevent recurrent bleeding can be implemented. We prefer beta blockers over variceal ligation for prophylaxis in such patients because of the risk of bleeding from esophageal ulcers that form when the bands used for variceal ligation slough off. This approach is consistent with 2009 guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The PVT was thought to be chronic in 103 patients (76 percent). During follow-up of the group as a whole, the risk of thrombosis was similar to the risk of bleeding (5.5 versus 12.5 per 100 person-years). Anticoagulation did not appear to increase the risk of bleeding, but it did decrease the risk of thrombosis. Whether anticoagulation was associated with recanalization of the portal vein, improvement in liver function, or a lessening of portal hypertension was not addressed. The study was limited because it was retrospective (so it is possible that patients selected for anticoagulation may have been at relatively low risk for bleeding), the nature of the anticoagulation was variable, and most of the patients who were felt to have chronic PVT presented with signs of mesenteric venous ischemia, a finding that is unusual in patients with chronic PVT (suggesting that some of the patients classified as having chronic PVT may have had acute PVT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2232571687\"><span class=\"h4\">Cirrhotic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticoagulation may be beneficial for cirrhotic patients with portal vein thrombosis.

The overall rate of bleeding (ie, both minor and major episodes) was similar in the anticoagulated and untreated patients (11 percent in both groups). The risk of variceal bleeding was assessed in four studies including 158 patients, and the variceal bleeding rate was lower in anticoagulated patients compared with untreated patients (2 versus 12 percent; OR 0.23, 95%CI 0.06-0.94). A clinical trial is needed to validate the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant therapy in this setting and identify which patients should be treated.</p><p>Data on the use of anticoagulation in cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation are limited. In a study of 19 patients with advanced cirrhosis who were awaiting liver transplantation, anticoagulation was associated with restoration of portal vein patency in 10, compared with 0 of 10 historic controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Four patients failed attempts at endoscopic treatment but did well after surgical portal-systemic shunting. Biliary decompression should be performed prior to biliary surgery because instrumentation of an obstructed biliary tract puts patients at high risk for cholangitis.

Definitive salvage therapy should be considered for patients who experience repeated hemorrhage despite adequate endoscopic treatment, have isolated varices in the gastric fundus, or have ectopic varices (eg, splenectomy or surgical shunting depending upon the site of bleeding). Surgery corrects the varices and is usually well-tolerated because liver function typically remains well-preserved in the absence of cirrhosis. Recurrent hemorrhage due to portal hypertension related to extensive portal vein thrombosis is clinically uncommon and if a collateral vessel is large enough to place a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is present, an attempt to decompress the portal system by a TIPS should be made. However, there is only sparse data related to the efficacy of this intervention. Experience with the Suguira procedure in Western countries is limited and should be attempted only at centers with expertise. The severity of underlying liver failure also dictates the surgical risk.</p><p>The choice of surgery depends upon the anatomy of obstruction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenectomy is used for patients splenic vein thrombosis and bleeding gastric varices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68680\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68680 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with diffuse thrombosis of the portal, mesenteric, and splenic veins, a shunt operation may not be possible.

Patients with chronic PVT may also develop intestinal ischemia and infarction if there is extension of the clot into the superior mesenteric vein, though the risk is small. Patients with chronic PVT may also have clinical manifestations related underlying conditions that predisposed to PVT, such as cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73799 \">table 1</a>).
