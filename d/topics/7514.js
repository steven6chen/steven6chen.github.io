Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) is the term used to describe amenorrhea that results from such causes and is diagnosed after excluding other etiologies of amenorrhea. The terms functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) are often used interchangeably.</p><p>FHA is presumed to be a functional disruption of pulsatile, hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. The abnormal GnRH secretion characteristic of FHA leads to decreased pulses of gonadotropins, absent midcycle surges in luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, absence of normal follicular development, anovulation, and low serum estradiol (E2) concentrations. Variable neuroendocrine patterns of LH secretion can be seen. Serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are low or normal and often exceed those of LH, similar to the pattern in prepubertal girls.</p><p>This topic will review the evaluation and management of FHA. The pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of FHA, as well as the approach to women with primary and secondary amenorrhea, are presented separately.

The diagnosis of FHA is based upon the findings of amenorrhea, low serum gonadotropins and estradiol (E2), and, usually, evidence of a precipitating factor (exercise, low weight, stress). As in every woman with new-onset amenorrhea, other causes should first be excluded before diagnosing this condition. Our approach is consistent with the Endocrine Society's 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of FHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The evaluation of both types of amenorrhea includes a thorough history and physical examination, biochemical testing, assessment of estrogen status, and, in some cases, imaging. These are reviewed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F106752\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106752 \">algorithm 2</a>).

In some women, menses may stop without a preceding period of oligomenorrhea. If a woman had exercise-induced amenorrhea in the past, which remitted when she decreased exercising, it is likely to recur if she resumes exercising without compensatory caloric increase. Some women (more commonly adolescents) may present with primary amenorrhea, although this is less common.</p><p>The patient should be asked if she has had weight loss, low-weight eating disorders, dieting, excessive exercise, or psychogenic stressors. One way to ascertain whether weight is a potential cause is to ask the patient what her approximate weight was when she was having regular menses. This weight can then be used as a benchmark for comparison with her weights during times of menstrual <span class=\"nowrap\">dysfunction/amenorrhea</span>. In order to exclude other causes of amenorrhea, as it is a diagnosis of exclusion, it is also important to ask about pregnancy and symptoms that might suggest inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, thyroid disease, or other disorders associated with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, as reviewed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73995 \">table 1</a>).

FSH is the best test for primary ovarian insufficiency, but we also measure luteinizing hormone (LH) and E2 when we suspect FHA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a>). If there is evidence of hyperandrogenism, we measure serum androgens. However, most women being evaluated for FHA are underweight, not overweight or obese like women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). There may be some overlap with lean women with PCOS who are hyperexercisers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Biochemical testing'</a>.)</p><p><strong>Low </strong>levels of LH, FSH, and E2 are typically seen in FHA, but this pattern is also seen with any cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, including hypothalamic or pituitary tumors. In most women with FHA, FSH is greater than LH, particularly during recovery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109616\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Measurement of a serum E2 concentration at the time of the LH and FSH measurements is another way to assess estrogen status. If LH, FSH, and E2 are all low, the patient has hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (and likely FHA if the patient's history is consistent with the diagnosis). Women with PCOS are not estrogen deficient. In women with primary amenorrhea, withdrawal bleeding following the progestin challenge test also indicates an intact uterus, cervix, and vagina. This issue is reviewed in detail separately.

The first step of management is to encourage weight gain through lifestyle changes, such as increased caloric intake to match energy expenditure and reduced exercise.

First-line therapy for women with FHA (caused by decreased energy availability) and anovulatory infertility is therefore increased caloric intake as it is highly effective and can result in restored ovulation or, possibly, sufficient endogenous estrogen production that the individual may respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate. If a woman does not eat enough to have regular cycles and normal fertility, her nutrient intake during a hormonally induced pregnancy is likely to be inadequate for normal fetal growth and development, and in those with low weight, the spontaneous abortion rate is elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and low birth weight of the newborn is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-evaluation-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

This often involves weight gain, which should eventually lead to a resumption of menses (see <a href=\"#H1064215173\" class=\"local\">'Weight gain/lifestyle changes'</a> above). Weight gain and resumption of menses affect bony sites slightly differently, with weight gain causing preferential increases in bone density of the total hip and whole body, whereas menses resumption leads to preferential increases in bone density at the lumbar spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-evaluation-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The magnitude of change in bone density following weight gain and menstrual resumption is variable, with studies reporting increases ranging from 3 to 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-evaluation-and-management/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].

The evaluation of amenorrhea includes a thorough history and physical examination, biochemical testing, assessment of estrogen status, and, in some cases, imaging.
