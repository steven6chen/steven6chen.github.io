These are often overlooked because neonatal infections due to bacteria, viruses, and <em>Candida</em> are more prevalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nonetheless, noncandidal fungal infections occur in neonates resulting in significant mortality and morbidity. They include aspergillosis, cutaneous and intestinal zygomycosis, <em>Malassezia</em> sepsis, trichosporonosis, <em>Pichia</em> sepsis, cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, and dermatophytosis.</p><p>Similarly to <em>Candida</em> infections, the incidence of noncandidal fungal infections in neonates appears to be increasing, particularly in preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Preterm infants may be more vulnerable to fungal infections because of their immature immune systems and poorly developed epithelial skin and mucosal barriers, and the high rate of invasive procedures, such as central venous catheters and intubation, which compromise host defenses (eg, skin integrity). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for Candida infection in neonates&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Noncandidal fungal infections in the neonate and their treatment will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, treatment, and prevention of neonatal <em>Candida</em> infection are reviewed separately.

Infections are most commonly caused by <em>A. fumigatus</em>, <em>A. flavus</em>, and <em>A. niger</em>. Mortality is very high in infected neonates, even when treated with antifungal therapy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Reports of neonatal <em>Aspergillus</em> infection appear to be increasing. In a review of the literature from 2002, 16 of the 17 cases of primary cutaneous aspergillosis were published after 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for neonatal aspergillosis include gestational age (GA) below 32 weeks, birth weight (BW) below 1500 g, and new construction or hospital renovations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, hospital gauze, bedding, tape, and dressing are vehicles for transmission of <em>Aspergillus</em> spores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The administration of broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics and corticosteroids are also strongly associated with disseminated aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In neonates, primary infection generally involves either the skin or respiratory tract. Rapid systemic dissemination may occur, resulting in significant mortality.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous &minus; Preterm infants are at increased risk for primary cutaneous aspergillosis because their skin is thin and delicate. Typically, the skin lesion begins as an erythematous patch or a plaque that rapidly progresses to hemorrhagic bullae. Within 24 hours, the lesion subsequently develops into purpuric ulcerations and black eschar formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>].

The organism also has a propensity to invade blood vessels, causing thrombosis, infarction, and necrosis. Hemorrhagic necrosis is frequently seen in the lung and gastrointestinal tract in autopsies of affected patients. Rare manifestations of disseminated disease include meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and obstructive renal aspergilloma in a neonate with bladder exstrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of aspergillosis can be made by identifying <em>Aspergillus</em> by microscopic examination or culture of tissue obtained by biopsy or from body fluids.

The older, and more common, term &quot;mucormycosis&quot; is familiar to most clinicians. However, zygomycosis has become the preferred term since other members of this class of fungi can cause infection, in addition to those in the order Mucorales.</p><p>Although Zygomycetes fungi are uncommon causes of neonatal infections, there are several reports of infections in newborn infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]. Infections are due to organisms from the genera <em>Rhizopus</em>, <em>Mucor</em>, and <em>Absidia</em>.</p><p>Risk factors for neonatal zygomycosis include prematurity, low BW, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids, and local skin trauma due to vascular catheters and adhesive dressings. Transmission of the fungi may be due to contact with contaminated surfaces such as adhesive tape or dressing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In one report, four cases of <em>R. microsporus</em> in preterm infants were due to contaminated wooden tongue depressors used as splints to secure intravenous and arterial cannulation sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Clinical presentations of neonatal zygomycosis include primary cutaneous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] or gastrointestinal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/12,13,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,15,16</a>]. Gastrointestinal disease resembles necrotizing enterocolitis, but without the radiological changes, and is associated with a high mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/12,15,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15,21</a>].

Vascular invasion is the hallmark of zygomycosis and is often associated with vascular thrombosis and tissue necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis relies upon the identification of organisms in tissues by histopathology with culture confirmation. However, the organism often does not grow in culture, and histopathological identification of a Zygomycete may provide the only evidence of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucormycosis-zygomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucormycosis (zygomycosis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Therapy consists of local debridement or surgical resection, and the administration of amphotericin B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/13-15,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15,25,26</a>]. Maintaining skin integrity by avoiding trauma to the skin by insertion of catheters and dressings, as much as possible, is the best approach to prevent primary cutaneous infection.

As a result, most experts do not recommend amphotericin B as the sole drug to treat CNS neonatal fungal infections. In these patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">flucytosine</a> should be added to amphotericin, because both agents penetrate the CSF well and are synergistic to amphotericin B.</p><p>Similar to treatment of invasive candidal infection, the duration of therapy is uncertain. Most neonatologists and pediatric infectious disease specialists treat for a minimum of 14 days after sterilization of the infected body fluid.

Although case reports have shown that they are effective in treating coccidioidomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] and <em>Trichosporon</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], they are typically reserved for neonates who develop intolerant infusion-related reactions or renal dysfunction during standard amphotericin B administration.

Although there is a potential for nephrotoxicity, most infants display no or only mild nephrotoxicity, which resolves with decreasing the dose of the medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unusual-fungal-infections-in-the-neonate/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Other reported adverse effects include hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia caused by excessive renal losses, bone marrow suppression with anemia and thrombocytopenia, and an increase in hepatic enzymes. These abnormalities are infrequent, dose dependent, and resolve with cessation of the drug.</p><p>Because of the potential adverse effects, infants should have serial monitoring of serum potassium, magnesium and creatinine, liver enzymes, and complete blood count while receiving amphotericin B.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluconazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triazoles are antifungal agents that inhibit the 14-alpha-sterol demethylase of the cytochrome P450 system, which is necessary for the production of ergosterol, a major component of the fungal cell membrane. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Fluconazole</a> is the most commonly used triazole in neonatal practice.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Fluconazole</a> is available in both intravenous and oral preparations.

However, when they occur, these infections result in significant neonatal mortality and morbidity. Noncandidal fungal infections include aspergillosis, cutaneous and intestinal zygomycosis, <em>Malassezia</em> sepsis, trichosporonosis, <em>Pichia</em> sepsis, cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, and dermatophytosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of these infections is increasing, particularly in preterm infants. Other associated risk factors for fungemia in addition to prematurity include the administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, use of immunosuppressive therapy (eg, corticosteroids), invasive procedures (eg, central venous catheters), and, in some cases, new hospital construction or renovations. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal fungal infections other than candida'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for Candida infection in neonates&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for invasive candidiasis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with known or suspected fungemia or central nervous system (CNS) infection require immediate systemic antifungal therapy.
