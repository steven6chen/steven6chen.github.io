The approach to biopsy of the suspicious lesion is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1915893211\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Melanoma: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">WIDE LOCAL EXCISION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitive surgical treatment for primary cutaneous melanoma is a wide local excision down to the deep fascia. The recommended width of the normal tissue around the lesion has progressively decreased as a result of multiple large clinical trials that have examined the impact of the surgical margin on the local recurrence rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73371\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73371 \">table 1</a>). Most excisions should be performed with elliptical incisions, with the required margin included in the short axis of the ellipse. These excisions should be oriented as described above. Closure may be facilitated by curving the ends of the ellipse in a sigmoidal fashion.</p><p>The thickness of the melanoma is a key factor in determining the stage of the lesion and the recommended margin of normal tissue to be resected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Melanomas &le;2 mm thick (T1, T2)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach is to resect melanomas &le;1 mm thick (T1) with a 1 cm margin of normal tissue. For melanomas &gt;1 to 2 mm thick (T2 lesions) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110664 \">table 3</a>), we use a 2 cm margin of normal tissue if this is feasible without the need for a skin graft; a 1 to 2 cm margin may be adequate if anatomically constrained based upon the location of the lesion. Adequacy of excision is based on margin measurement by the surgeon at the time of operation.</p><p>These recommendations are based upon several large clinical trials that have studied the optimal resection margins for patients with thin (T1, T2) primary melanomas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a World Health Organization (WHO) trial, 612 patients with melanomas &lt;2 mm thick were randomly assigned to wide local excision with a 3 cm margin or with a 1 cm margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. At 12-year follow-up, survival rates were similar (87 versus 85 percent), and the local recurrence rate for all patients was 1.8 percent. There were four local recurrences in patients with lesions 1.1 to 2 mm thick in the 1 cm margin group, compared with none in the 3 cm margin group, a difference that was not statistically significant. Based upon these results, the WHO recommended the use of 1 cm margins for patients with melanomas &le;1 mm thick and made no recommendation for thicker melanomas. However, in a subsequent report with additional follow-up, the 3 cm margin group had a local recurrence rate of 1 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60305\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60305 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Two-thirds of the patients who developed a local recurrence died.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial conducted by the Swedish Melanoma Study Group, 989 patients with melanomas 0.8 to 2 mm thick were randomly assigned to 2 cm or 5 cm resection margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At a median follow-up of 11 years, the rate of local recurrence for all patients was less than 1 percent and was similar in both groups. There were no differences between the groups in either overall or disease-free survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third trial sponsored by the French Cooperative Group consisted of 362 patients with melanomas &le;2 mm in thickness, who were randomly assigned to 2 cm versus 5 cm margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There was no difference between the groups in the risk of local recurrence or in overall survival.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Melanomas 2.01 to 4 mm (T3)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For primary melanomas between 2 and 4 mm thick (T3), we suggest a 2 cm margin. Clinical trials have not demonstrated a benefit of excision margins &gt;2 cm.</p><p>The clinical trial data supporting this approach include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter European trial that enrolled patients from 1992 to 2004, 936 patients with a resected melanoma greater than 2 mm thick were randomly assigned to have either a 2 cm or 4 cm resection margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The study was originally designed to include 2000 patients, but the trial was terminated early when accrual slowed. After a median follow-up of 6.7 years, there was no statistically significant difference in either recurrence-free or overall survival (hazard ratios [HR] 0.98 and 1.00).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Melanoma Intergroup Trial randomly assigned 468 patients with intermediate thickness (1 to 4 mm) melanomas to 2 cm or 4 cm excision margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. At a median follow-up of eight years, the rates of overall survival and local recurrence-free survival were not significantly decreased with the 2 cm excision margin (80 versus 84 percent with a 4 cm margin and 0.8 versus 1.7 percent, respectively). On multivariate analysis, statistically significant independent predictors of local recurrence included tumor thickness and ulceration, but not the excision margin. Patients treated with the 2 cm excision margin had a shorter hospital stay and required skin grafting less frequently (11 versus 46 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third trial, a higher locoregional recurrence rate (local and nodal recurrence, in transit metastases) was observed in a British trial that randomly assigned 900 patients with lesions &ge;2 mm thick to 1 cm or 3 cm margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At a median follow-up of 60 months, the risk of locoregional recurrence was significantly higher with 1 cm margins (HR 1.26), but the difference in melanoma-specific survival did not reach the level of statistical significance (HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.96-1.61). However, a subsequent further analysis with 8.8 years of follow-up found that the melanoma specific survival difference was statistically significant (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.00-1.53) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The authors concluded that 1 cm surgical margins should be restricted to patients with tumor thickness &lt;2 mm, and that thicker melanomas require excision margins that exceed 1 cm. These results are consistent with current recommendations.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Melanomas &gt;4 mm (T4)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For thick melanomas (ie, those &gt;4 mm), we also suggest an excision margin of 2 cm. There is no evidence that margins &gt;2 cm decrease the incidence of local recurrence. In this group, the outcome depends upon the presence of regional <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distant disease.</p><p>Data about the optimal approach in this setting are more limited:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the British trial involving 900 patients, 243 patients (27 percent) had lesions &gt;4 mm thick [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Overall, that trial observed an increased risk of local recurrence with 1 cm surgical margins compared with 3 cm (HR 1.26).

An international multicenter trial randomly assigned 832 patients with stage II resected melanoma to excision alone or surgery followed by hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At a median follow-up of six years, adjuvant ILP was associated with a significantly lower incidence of regional recurrence (2.5 versus 9.9 percent without ILP), but there was no improvement in overall survival.</p><p>However, an occasional patient may present with a large primary tumor for which resection would require extensive disfigurement. In this situation, regional chemotherapy may sometimes be utilized to downsize these tumors prior to definitive resection.

Multiple factors may contribute to this anatomic predilection for the skin of the head and neck, including higher levels of sun exposure and a melanocyte content of the skin that is two- to threefold higher than other regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

These recommendations were derived from trials in which most patients had extremity or truncal melanomas. In the head and neck, such margins are not always attainable and may result in significant functional and cosmetic disability. Although skin grafts on the face are avoided whenever possible, the appropriate excision margins for the degree of tumor thickness should not be compromised solely because of cosmetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Plastic surgery flap reconstruction may be required and can accomplish excellent cosmetic results. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Wide local excision'</a> above.)</p><p>Intraoperative frozen section analysis may be helpful when tissue conservation is important. However, the use of frozen section analysis carries a small but real risk of a false negative report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, frozen section analysis should be used judiciously and only by surgeons and pathologists with experience in its use. An effective alternative when complex closures or flaps are needed is to delay closure until after final pathologic evaluation is completed, at which time additional margin resection may be performed if necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parotid and cervical lymphatics are the most common sites of spread for melanomas of the head and neck. Desmoplastic melanoma are more common in the head and neck region than in other areas of the body, and have a decreased frequency of lymph node metastases compared with other melanomas. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Desmoplastic melanoma'</a> below.) </p><p>In contrast to the widespread acceptance of lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy for extremity and truncal melanomas, the role of this technique in cutaneous melanomas of the head and neck continues to evolve. The use of this approach has been limited by the complexity of lymphatic drainage patterns and the frequent need to remove sentinel nodes from the parotid gland, thereby risking damage to the facial nerve. A sentinel node can be identified in approximately 95 percent of patients with low false negative rates when appropriate techniques are utilized by experienced surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Ten percent of patients had melanoma involving at least one lymph node. Multivariate analysis found that a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy was the strongest predictor for subsequent relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 2.81). Other independent prognostic factors associated with recurrent disease included tumor ulceration (HR 2.34) and location of the tumor on the scalp (HR 1.94).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjuvant RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is used for situations in which the risk of and morbidity from local or regional recurrence may be substantial or if there is a very high risk of locoregional recurrence.
