Originally described by Bickerstaff in 1961 as a distinct clinical entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], previous descriptions consistent with MBA were given by Aretaeus in ancient Greece and by Gowers in 1907 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The terminology used to describe what some have called &quot;Bickerstaff syndrome&quot; has evolved over time; &quot;basilar artery migraine&quot; was replaced by &quot;basilar migraine&quot; and then by &quot;basilar-type migraine.&quot; The disorder is now called migraine with brainstem aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Each subsequent term attempted to maintain the identity of the disorder, while weakening the association with the basilar artery. This evolution has occurred because there is no evidence that the basilar artery is involved, and because some of the symptoms may localize outside the territory of the basilar artery.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of MBA. Other aspects of migraine are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135982201\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most experts now consider MBA as a subset of migraine with aura, and its etiology rests in the theory that cortical spreading depression produces the aura. Cortical spreading depression is a self propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization that spreads across the cerebral cortex (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults#H130649634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Cortical spreading depression'</a>). The difference between MBA and migraine with typical aura is that the location of the aura symptoms in MBA primarily involves the brainstem or the bilateral occipital hemispheres, whereas in typical migraine the aura symptoms are mainly restricted to a unilateral hemisphere. However, cortical spreading depression as the cause of altered local blood flow and metabolism in the brainstem has only been proven in animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Bickerstaff invoked the vascular hypothesis, the prevailing theory at the time, to explain the symptoms of &quot;basilar artery migraine&quot; that were referable to either the brainstem or the bioccipital hemispheres [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a later publication, he acknowledged that he had &quot;rather loosely termed&quot; this condition basilar artery migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In truth, there is no evidence that the basilar artery is involved in the etiology of MBA, and abnormal flow in the basilar artery has never been proven in MBA. Only two cases, one with familial hemiplegic migraine with MBA-like symptoms, and one with MBA, have shown ictal spasm of the basilar artery on angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Another case was reported with reduced mean flow velocity in both posterior cerebral arteries during a single MBA episode with resolution after the aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Despite these reports, it is unlikely that reversible ischemia is the source of the prolonged symptoms that occur with MBA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135982426\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are limited regarding the genetic basis of MBA. A mutation in the ATP1A2 gene was found in three first-degree relatives with MBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and another study reported that a single patient suffering from attacks of both MBA and episodic ataxia type 2 had a novel nonsense mutation in the CACNA1A gene, which has been frequently implicated in patients with familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These findings suggest a possible shared pathogenetic mechanism between MBA and FHM (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemiplegic-migraine#H1735110\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemiplegic migraine&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology and genetics'</a>). However, in a population-based study from Denmark, no causative mutation for MBA or genetic linkage was identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Some have questioned whether FHM is a genetic form of MBA because 72 percent of hemiplegic migraineurs exhibit attacks that, if they did not include the additional hemiparesis, would best be described as MBA according to the current diagnostic criteria (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below) for MBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/4,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13,14</a>]. This clinical overlap suggests that MBA and hemiplegic migraine are part of a phenotypic spectrum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initially thought to involve only adolescent women, MBA may affect both genders at any age with a female to male ratio ranging from 1.3:1 to 3.8:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/12,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15,16</a>]. The actual incidence or prevalence is unknown, as various diagnostic criteria have been applied through the years without uniformity. The age of onset is usually between 7 and 20. Attacks may evolve to more typical common forms of migraine with age. As with other types of migraine, there is often a family history of migraine among individuals with MBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>]. The range of findings is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 30 patients with MBA who were followed for six months to three years, a family history of migraine was present in 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A later onset of MBA tended to be associated with a more severe phenotype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based study from Denmark identified families in which migraine with nonhemiplegic aura occurred in both a proband and a sib pair; 105 families comprising 362 patients were enrolled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The following observations were noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MBA was found in 38 patients (10 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among patients with MBA, attacks of migraine with typical aura occurred in 36 (95 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The median age of onset for migraine with typical aura and MBA was 14 and 17 years of age, respectively. Furthermore, MBA onset never occurred before the onset of migraine with typical aura.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series reported 49 patients (32 women) with MBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The age of onset ranged from 10 to 62, with most (65 percent) having their first attack by the third decade. Other migraines with brainstem-related symptoms occurred in 60 percent, and altered or lost consciousness occurred in 77 percent of attacks. A family history of migraine or epilepsy was present in 73 percent and 12 percent respectively. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical characteristics of MBA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73674\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73674 \">table 1</a>) were first described in Bickerstaff's 1961 report of 34 patients (26 women), who had attacks of aura lasting 2 to 45 minutes, most often with unilateral or bilateral hemianopic visual disturbance, vertigo, ataxia, dysarthria, bilateral tingling, or numbness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The aura was typically followed by a throbbing occipital headache and nausea. Loss of consciousness lasting 2 to 30 minutes occurred in 25 percent of these individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The report emphasized the paroxysmal and alarming nature of the symptoms, their eventual complete resolution, and the strong family and personal history of migraine.</p><p>Subsequent studies have confirmed and clarified the clinical phenotype of MBA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study from Denmark of families in which migraine with nonhemiplegic aura occurred in both a proband and a sib pair, MBA affected 29 families and 38 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The following observations were noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MBA aura had a median duration of 60 minutes (range 2 minutes to 72 hours). The frequency of typical MBA aura symptoms was as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Vertigo in 61 percent of patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Dysarthria in 53 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Tinnitus in 45 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Diplopia in 45 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Bilateral visual symptoms in 40 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Bilateral paresthesia in 24 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Decreased level of consciousness in 24 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Hypacusis in 21 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients had some type of visual aura during attacks of MBA; those who did not have a bilateral visual aura had a unilateral visual aura. Furthermore, aphasic auras during attacks of MBA occurred in 15 patients (40 percent) and unilateral sensory aura occurred in 14 patients (37 percent). Two or more aura symptoms always occurred in attacks of MBA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Attacks of MBA were always associated with headache in 28 patients (74 percent), while attacks with or without headache occurred in 10 patients (26 percent). No causative mutations for MBA or genetic linkage were identified. The authors concluded that there is no firm epidemiologic, clinical, or genetic evidence that MBA is a separate entity from migraine with typical aura.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series reported 49 patients (32 women) with MBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Altered or lost consciousness occurred in 77 percent of attacks. A family history of migraine or epilepsy was present in 73 percent and 12 percent respectively. In most, the aura lasted 5 to 60 minutes, and the headache lasted from four hours to two days. Electroencephalography (EEG) was performed in 38 patients, and all were abnormal ictally with slow waves that resolved along with the spell. Migraine triggers included emotional stress, menstruation, barometric pressure changes, head trauma, foods, contraceptive drugs, smoking, and exertion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with MBA have neuro-otologic abnormalities and may present to dizziness clinics for vestibular symptoms. In one series of 50 patients with MBA, most had minor vestibular abnormalities, and a few had severe peripheral injury thought to be a result of basilar migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another series of 20 children with presumed MBA reported that 16 had abnormal bithermal caloric testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>Prolonged impairment of consciousness (greater than two weeks) with marked generalized slow-wave delta activity has been reported in one patient with MBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Specific brainstem localizing syndromes (eg, Wallenberg syndrome) and focal cranial nerve dysfunction are rare in MBA, perhaps because MBA is a manifestation of a maladaptive nervous system, not the spasm of a focal arterial territory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of MBA is suspected whenever patients present with episodic attacks of vertigo, dysarthria, diplopia, ataxia, confusion, or obtundation, particularly when in conjunction with more typical migraine auras consisting of visual, sensory, or aphasic symptoms. The diagnosis of MBA remains a clinical task and is based upon a compatible history, physical examination, and fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below). There are no diagnostic tests specific for MBA.</p><p>A brain MRI and an MR angiogram (MRA) of the intracranial and extracranial vessels should be performed in most patients with first-ever MBA symptoms to search for posterior fossa parenchymal or vascular lesions, particularly vertebrobasilar thrombosis, aneurysms, ectasia, stenosis, arteriovenous malformations, or dissections. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) can be performed as an alternative to MRA, particularly if MR scanning is contraindicated or the patient is intolerant of MR. Conventional angiography may be warranted in cases where noninvasive MRA or CTA imaging is nondiagnostic.</p><p>Some patients suspected of MBA may have reversible MRI changes within the occipital cortex due to vasogenic edema, but no reliable MRI findings are diagnostic of MBA. Rather, the role of MRI is to rule out other possibilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Repeated imaging of the brain and vessels is not necessary in patients who have recurrent stereotyped episodes of MBA.</p><p>An electroencephalogram may be useful to look for epileptiform activity in patients who have periodic altered consciousness. A 24-hour cardiac monitor may help discern episodic arrhythmias. Special coagulation profiles should be performed in patients with paroxysmal brainstem syndromes, especially if the family history suggests a prothrombotic tendency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic criteria for migraine with brainstem aura from the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A) At least two attacks fulfilling criteria B through D</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B) Aura consisting of visual, sensory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">speech/language</span> symptoms, each fully reversible, but no motor or retinal symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C) At least two of the following brainstem symptoms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dysarthria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vertigo</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tinnitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypacusis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diplopia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ataxia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased level of consciousness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D) At least two of the following four characteristics:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At least one aura symptom spreads gradually over &ge;5 minutes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> two or more symptoms occur in succession</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Each individual aura symptom lasts 5 to 60 minutes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At least one aura symptom is unilateral</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The aura is accompanied, or followed within 60 minutes, by headache</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>E) Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis, and transient ischemic attack has been excluded</p><p/><p>Of note, the ICHD-3 criteria specify that presence of aura with motor symptoms excludes MBA and points to the diagnosis of hemiplegic migraine (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemiplegic-migraine#H1734585\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemiplegic migraine&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Some have argued that this theoretical risk is based primarily on the relatively outdated vascular theory of migraine (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;</a>) and the contraindication should be reconsidered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. A retrospective series of 13 patients with MBA, hemiplegic migraine, and prolonged aura exposed to triptans reported no increased risk of adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The concern is that beta blockers may potentially limit compensatory vasodilatory capacitance of cerebral vessels. Similar to hemiplegic migraine, there is anecdotal evidence that beta blockers may lead to ischemia in patients with MBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/migraine-with-brainstem-aura-basilar-type-migraine/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flunarizine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flunarizine</a> for MBA is also based upon its apparent benefit for hemiplegic migraine; flunarizine is not available in the United States.

Of concern, a benign rash may develop in up to 10 percent of patients during the initial one to two months of lamotrigine therapy and necessitates discontinuation of the drug; the risk of developing a life-threatening rash such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome is approximately 1 in 1000 adults. This risk is increased dramatically in children, leading to the recommendation that the drug not be used in patients under the age of 16 years.</p><p/><p>Since MBA is a subset of migraine with aura, preventive medications for migraine such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> or valproic acid may be beneficial, and we suggest them as alternatives if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> are ineffective or intolerable.

Cortical spreading depression appears to be the mechanism underlying the aura. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H135982201\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although more common in females, MBA may affect both genders. Onset is usually between ages 7 to 20. Attacks may evolve to more typical forms of migraine with age. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attacks of MBA nearly always include two or more aura symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73674\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73674 \">table 1</a>). These develop gradually over &ge;5 minutes or occur sequentially over &ge;5 minutes. Auras characteristic of MBA in include some combination of vertigo, dysarthria, tinnitus, diplopia, bilateral paresthesia, decreased level of consciousness, ataxia or hypacusis. Visual and aphasic auras are common with MBA, while motor weakness or hemiplegia is excluded by definition. An individual MBA aura generally lasts five minutes to two hours. Most patients with MBA also have attacks of migraine with typical aura. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of MBA is broad. Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or ischemic stroke, hemiplegic migraine, complex partial seizures, and a number of peripheral and central causes of vertigo are considerations. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiemetics such as phenothiazine and other nonvasoconstricting abortive agents such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used to treat the headache associated with MBA.

Sustained release verapamil is started at 120 mg once daily and increased to 120 mg twice daily (total 240 mg daily). The dose can be further titrated up to 120 mg daily three times a day (total 360 mg daily) for most patients if needed. However, we suggest using no more than 120 mg daily of verapamil for small or older adult patients.

Lamotrigine should be discontinued if a rash develops. Patients with MBA who do not benefit from verapamil, topiramate, or lamotrigine may be treated with other preventive medications including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> or valproic acid.
