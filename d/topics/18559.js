The inflammation may occur as a primary process or secondary to an underlying disease. Clinical symptoms vary widely depending upon the types and location of the vessels involved, the extent of inflammation, and subsequent vessel wall damage with associated hemodynamic changes.</p><p>The primary vasculitides may be classified according to their clinical manifestations, the size and type of the involved blood vessels, and the pathologic changes found within the vessel walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The nomenclature and criteria used for classification of the primary childhood vasculitides will be reviewed here. The approach to the child with suspected vasculitis and an overview of the management of children with vasculitic disorders are presented separately. The classification and approach to vasculitides in adults are also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-management-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Management overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasculitis is rare in children as demonstrated by the following two population-based studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an English survey of family clinicians, the estimated overall annual incidence of new cases of vasculitis was 53.3 per 100,000 children under 17 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The two most common vasculitides were immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura) and Kawasaki disease, with estimated annual incidences of 20.4 and 5.5 per 100,000 in children less than 17 years of age, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from the Czech Republic, a hospital-based estimate of the annual incidence of vasculitis was lower, at 12 per 100,000 children under 17 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The annual incidences of IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura) and Kawasaki disease were 10.2 and 1.6 per 100,000 children under 17 years of age, respectively.</p><p/><p>Both of these surveys are likely to underestimate the incidence of childhood vasculitides since they are based upon voluntary surveys of clinicians serving limited segments of the population. The former report is probably nearer the truth since the Czech study might not have detected affected children who never came to the attention of hospital-based clinicians. In fact, other estimates of Kawasaki disease incidence have yielded values approximately twice those of the British report. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-epidemiology-and-etiology#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>As noted in these two studies, IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura) is the most common vasculitis followed by Kawasaki disease. Other rarer vasculitides in children include Takayasu arteritis (which occurs more frequently in children from the Far East and Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, primary angiitis of the central nervous system, and polyarteritis nodosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome, is extremely rare in children, and temporal arteritis is not seen in pediatric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION VERSUS DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classification criteria were developed in order to standardize clinical definitions of different vasculitides. The goal was to facilitate and improve research efforts by defining consistent and homogeneous patient populations for clinical protocols and outcome studies. Classification criteria were not developed to diagnose disease in individuals and have not been validated for clinical diagnosis.</p><p>Because childhood vasculitides are rare, individual clinicians with limited or no previous exposure to particular conditions may use classification criteria to assist in the diagnosis of individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, studies in adult patients with vasculitis have shown that the diagnostic accuracy is low if classification criteria are used to make the diagnosis of a specific vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In particular, failure to meet the classification criteria does not necessarily preclude a specific diagnosis. The gold standard for diagnosing childhood vasculitis is with either histopathology from tissue biopsy samples or by characteristic lesions detected by imaging studies. However, in certain vasculitides such as Kawasaki disease, immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura), and frequently granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), diagnosis is more often based upon syndrome recognition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary vasculitides may be classified based upon their clinical manifestations, size of the involved blood vessel, histopathology of the damaged vessel, or the presumed underlying disease pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. The most widely used nomenclature was proposed by the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) on systemic vasculitis in 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The 2013 updated classification scheme provided consensus recommendations on disease names, preferred abbreviations, and disease definitions, but no new classification criteria for individual diseases. The framework for classification of vasculitides is based upon the predominant size (large, medium, or small) of the involved vessels, with additional categories of variable-vessel vasculitis and single-organ vasculitis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) and immune complex vasculitis are subcategories of small-vessel vasculitis that reflect the knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms. The use of eponyms has also been phased out and replaced with terms that have pathophysiologic specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The 2013 CHCC classification scheme is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large-vessel vasculitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Giant cell (temporal) arteritis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Takayasu arteritis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medium-vessel vasculitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Polyarteritis nodosa</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Kawasaki disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small-vessel vasculitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Microscopic polyangiitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis &ndash; Previously Wegener's granulomatosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis &ndash; Previously Churg-Strauss syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immune complex small-vessel vasculitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Antiglomerular basement membrane disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variable-vessel vasculitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beh&ccedil;et's syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cogan's syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single-organ vasculitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasculitis associated with a systemic disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasculitis associated with probable etiology</p><p/><p>The most widely used classification criteria are those introduced by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, both the ACR classification criteria and the CHCC nomenclature classification are based upon data from adult patients. Because the ACR system was developed for classifying the vasculitides in adults, IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura) and Kawasaki disease, the two most common pediatric vasculitides, were not included. In addition, using the ACR schema, one-half to one-third of children with chronic systemic vasculitis could not be classified under a specific &quot;named&quot; vasculitis syndrome and would be categorized as &quot;unclassified&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/5,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,13</a>]. Other inadequacies in the performance of the classification systems in adult patients have been noted, and the systems of classification remain under scrutiny [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In 2005, the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES) proposed a system of classification for vasculitides that occur in children who are at or below 18 years of age. Specific classification criteria were proposed for the more common childhood vasculitic syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The rationale of this proposal was to incorporate and build upon the existing ACR criteria by adding individual criteria that are more frequent in, or characteristic of, childhood presentation. Theoretically, this would provide improved sensitivity and specificity for classification of pediatric disorders, with fewer children remaining &quot;unclassifiable.&quot; As an example, &quot;subglottic, tracheal, or endobronchial stenosis,&quot; a more frequent presentation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) in children, was added as a classification criterion for childhood granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's). The ACR classification system is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In 2008, the EULAR, PRES, and the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO), using a cohort of over 1000 patients collected from nearly 100 centers, conducted a formal statistical validation of the preliminary <span class=\"nowrap\">EULAR/PRES</span> classification criteria for IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura), Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. By consensus, minor changes to these criteria were made and improved sensitivity and specificity were demonstrated when applied to the same patient cohort. These criteria are referred to as the <span class=\"nowrap\">EULAR/PRINTO/PRES</span> criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">EULAR//PRINTO/PRES</span> framework for classification predated the 2013 CHCC classification framework. The <span class=\"nowrap\">EULAR/PRINTO/PRES</span> framework is also primarily based upon the size of the involved vessel, although it does not incorporate the small-vessel vasculitis subcategories of AAV and immune complex small-vessel vasculitis that were described later. Nor does it include the categories of variable-vessel vasculitis and single-organ vasculitis. The &quot;monogenic&quot; vasculitides that were subsequently discovered are also not incorporated into <span class=\"nowrap\">EULAR/PRINTO/PRES</span> or CHCC categorization frameworks.
