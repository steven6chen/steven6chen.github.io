In this topic review, the term &quot;anaphylaxis&quot; is applied to both immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions. The evaluation of patients who have experienced perioperative anaphylaxis and strategies for avoiding recurrent reactions during subsequent anesthesia will be reviewed here. The prevalence, etiologies, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of perioperative anaphylaxis are discussed separately.

The complexity of medications used for anesthesia and surgery present challenges when attempting to identify the cause, but critical interpretation of clinical information and select testing leads to better recognition of culprit drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>There are three goals of this evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collection of evidence to support or refute that the adverse perioperative event was anaphylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of the culprit agent so that the agent can be avoided in the future.

However, questioning the patient about prior anesthesia may be helpful in identifying previous exposures as well as agents that were tolerated in the past.</p><p>An initial step in evaluating a patient with suspected perioperative anaphylaxis is verification that the reaction was clinically consistent with anaphylaxis. Wheezing and urticaria are helpful in distinguishing anaphylaxis from other disorders. The characteristic signs and symptoms of perioperative anaphylaxis are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Records of the procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many cases, the evaluating allergy specialist must rely solely upon anesthesia and perioperative records and perhaps a verbal account from clinicians who were present. A review of drug administration records is essential to determine temporal relationships between the administration of various agents and the onset of symptoms. Operative notes may be helpful for identifying potential exposures to latex (eg, symptoms that began shortly after an internal organ was extensively manipulated and handled).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests for mast cell mediators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum or plasma tryptase <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> histamine elevations measured during or shortly after the reaction should be analyzed. An elevated tryptase level is highly suggestive of anaphylaxis, although a normal tryptase level does not exclude anaphylaxis.</p><p>In fatal cases, blood collected before death should be analyzed, as nonspecific increases in these mediators can occur immediately after death. The interpretation of these tests is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If these tests were not obtained at the time of the event, but blood samples were drawn for other purposes, it may still be possible to measure serum tryptase (although not histamine), as tryptase is stable in frozen serum for up to one year.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one large series, the estimated positive predictive value of tryptase elevations in 259 subjects with anesthesia-associated anaphylaxis was 93 percent, and the estimated negative predictive value of normal tryptase levels was 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study compared 75 subjects who were resuscitated for perioperative-allergic cardiopulmonary arrest and 25 control subjects who were resuscitated for nonallergic cardiopulmonary arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of an elevated tryptase or histamine were 90 to 92 percent for identifying an allergic cause. The cutoff values were 7.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> (7.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> for tryptase and 6.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> for histamine.</p><p/><p>The finding of elevated mast cell mediators indicates that mast <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/basophil</span> degranulation occurred, although it does not provide information about the mechanism (eg, IgE-mediated or other) of the reaction or the culprit trigger.</p><p>If serum tryptase is elevated, a repeat measurement should be performed when the patient has recovered to assure that levels are not persistently elevated. Patients with persistent elevations above 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> should be evaluated for the rare disorder, systemic mastocytosis. If the tryptase is above 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> but less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> the individual may be at risk of anaphylaxis due to a monoclonal mast cell disorder or idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome. The susceptibility of anaphylaxis in this condition has been demonstrated for insect hypersensitivity, although these individuals are likely at increased risk of anaphylaxis from other causes as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Evaluation and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-disorders-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell disorders: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of skin testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing (prick-puncture and intradermal) may be considered if the suspect agent is known to cause IgE-mediated reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60805 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Skin testing has no utility in the evaluation of anaphylaxis resulting from other mechanisms. Skin testing is more sensitive than in vitro testing in most cases, although the negative and positive predictive values of skin testing for most drugs is unknown.</p><p>The groups of agents that have most often been implicated in IgE-mediated perioperative anaphylaxis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain antibiotics (particularly beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin or cephalosporins)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Latex (approved in vitro testing is available in the United States and other parts of the world; approved skin test reagents are not available in the United States, but are in other countries)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital dyes (isosulfan blue)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Barbiturate induction agents</p><p/><p>Skin testing has also been described for streptokinase, chymopapain, and insulin, although these agents are rarely implicated in anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Case reports provide evidence that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>, an antiseptic commonly used in dental rinses, surgical scrubs, and sterilizing solutions, may cause anaphylaxis. Skin testing with chlorhexidine (0.5 percent chlorhexidine digluconate solution for prick-puncture skin testing; 0.0002 percent for intradermal testing) is positive in at least some of these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Suggested concentrations for skin testing of some agents are provided below. Nonspecific irritant reactions are possible with some drugs, although these should be less likely if the recommended concentrations are not exceeded. Testing with higher concentrations may result in nonspecific positive responses, even in people who have not had adverse reactions to the drug, making the test of no value. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Specific agents'</a> below.)</p><p>We generally test a patient with each of the medications that were administered prior to or during the adverse reaction, placing priority on those agents most likely to cause anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-management#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management&quot;, section on 'Etiologies'</a>.)</p><p>For those agents that have been implicated in causing anaphylaxis through multiple mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60805 \">table 1</a>), particularly NMBAs, we also perform skin testing for one or two potential alternative drugs that are available to the anesthesiologist involved in the case. This assists in planning for future anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Neuromuscular-blocking agents'</a> below.)</p><p>After an evaluation is performed in which culprit drugs are identified, the patient should be educated about the specific agent that likely caused the reaction and informed about how best to avoid this and any potentially cross-reacting drugs. The results of the evaluation and advice about avoiding future reactions should be relayed to the patient's primary care health professional, anesthesiologist, and surgeon. The patient should consider obtaining a medical identification bracelet or similar device that lists the culprit drug(s).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of skin testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing is usually delayed for four to eight weeks after the reaction, since false-negative results may be more likely immediately following anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. However, testing may be performed sooner if repeat anesthesia is necessary, as positive tests are still meaningful. This approach is supported by a study that compared the results of skin testing at two time points in patients with perioperative anaphylaxis; the first within four days of the reaction and the second, four to eight weeks after the reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Of patients with positive skin test results implicating a specific drug, 15 had positive results at the first testing, 22 at the second testing, 12 at both, 3 at only the first testing, and 10 at only the second testing. Until an evaluation has been completed, the agents statistically more likely to have caused the reaction should be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-management#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management&quot;, section on 'Etiologies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Accuracy and interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interpretation of skin testing requires clinical expertise, because the positive and negative predictive values for skin testing with most medications have not been systematically defined, with the notable exception of penicillin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite these limitations, a positive skin test to an agent that is known to cause IgE-mediated reactions, with appropriate positive (histamine) and negative (saline) controls, is usually interpreted as indicative of allergic sensitization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Techniques and precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergy skin testing ideally should only be performed by allergy specialists with training in the technique. Skin testing is considered safe for most patients, although it is not without risk. It is recommended that emergency equipment and medications, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, be available for treatment of the rare, yet potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis that can arise from the testing. A general review of skin testing techniques is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prick-puncture testing is safer than intradermal testing and is preferred for the initial testing. If prick-puncture testing is negative, intradermal testing can safely proceed. Intradermal testing is more sensitive than prick-puncture testing and thus provides maximal reassurance that the agent in question was not responsible for the adverse event. In general, the maximal concentration used for intradermal testing is 10- to 1000-fold more dilute than that used for prick-puncture testing. However, these concentrations are often determined empirically. If the concentration is too high, testing can induce either an irritant response or anaphylaxis. Both of these adverse outcomes are more likely with intradermal testing, so a reduction in concentration from that of the prick-puncture testing is employed. The concentration(s) chosen are dependent upon prior experience, perceived risk of anaphylaxis or published case series, and rarely on controlled trials.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the literature provides a nonirritating concentration for intradermal testing, the same concentration can be used for initial prick-puncture skin testing. If prick-puncture testing is negative, then intradermal testing can be performed, as intradermal testing is more sensitive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is no recommended testing concentration available in the literature, we begin prick-puncture testing with a 1:100 to 1:100,000 dilution of the concentration associated with the original reaction. The initial test concentration is based upon the severity of the reaction and the likelihood that the drug in question was responsible. A more dilute concentration may be used for the initial steps of testing if the patient's reaction was particularly severe. Repeat testing is performed with 10-fold increases in concentration until a positive prick-puncture test result or the clinically utilized concentration is reached.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If all prick-puncture tests are negative, then intradermal testing is performed starting at 1:100 to 1:1000 of the maximum prick-puncture concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Serial tests with 10-fold progressive increases in concentration are subsequently performed. The time required for testing may be reduced by using fewer dilutions (eg, 1:100, 1:10, and undiluted) first for prick-puncture testing, followed by the same dilutions for intradermal testing. Some experts are comfortable with this efficiency, while others prefer the additional safety of using more dilute starting solutions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate positive and negative controls are always required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A false-positive irritant reaction may occur with both prick-puncture and intradermal testing, but is more likely with the latter. If a positive prick-puncture or intradermal test occurs with a substance for which there are no specific published concentration recommendations, we advise testing several controls (eg, the clinician and a volunteer) to verify that the concentration does not cause a nonspecific, irritant response. The positive and negative predictive values are very limited when performing testing with drugs not rigorously studied, but this is often the only option to provide some guidance with respect to safety if no alternative choices for anesthesia are available.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of in vitro testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vitro immunoassays for allergen-specific IgE (the modern form of radioallergosorbent testing [RAST] using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] methodology) may be helpful in identifying the causative agent in IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, although very few of these are available commercially. In addition, some tests that are offered commercially are not validated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> involve drugs which have never been shown to induce IgE antibodies. Thus, skin testing is usually more reliable, in part because skin testing is more sensitive at detecting specific IgE. Neither type of testing has utility in the evaluation of anaphylaxis resulting from mechanisms other than IgE.</p><p>In vitro testing is mainly utilized in the evaluation of potential reactions to latex. A validated immunoassay to detect latex-specific IgE is commercially available. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Latex'</a> below.)</p><p>With the exception of penicillin and several other beta-lactam antibiotics, there are few in vitro tests available for most of the other medications and agents implicated in perioperative anaphylaxis. A detailed discussion of in vitro testing for allergic disease is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-in-vitro-allergy-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of in vitro allergy tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioperative anaphylaxis can result from more than one mechanism, and it is important to understand which mechanisms are associated with commonly implicated agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57346 \">table 2</a>). The pathophysiology of these reactions is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-management#H12436589\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of anaphylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>Certain agents have been repeatedly implicated in perioperative and perianesthesia anaphylaxis, including neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs), latex, antibiotics, barbiturate induction agents, blood products, super vital dyes, and possibly analgesics (opioids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuromuscular-blocking agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Europe, 50 to 70 percent of anaphylaxis related to anesthesia is attributed to neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs) (also referred to as muscle relaxants or paralytics). Anaphylaxis is less frequently associated with NMBAs in the United States. These agents can cause anaphylaxis through both immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and direct mast cell activation, although severe, life-threatening reactions are usually IgE-mediated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57346 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The epidemiology and risk factors of hypersensitivity to NMBAs are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-management#H315537455\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management&quot;, section on 'Neuromuscular-blocking agents'</a>.)</p><p>The explanation for the difference in prevalence of NMBA-associated anaphylaxis in Europe versus the United States may be a result of false-positive results when skin testing for NMBA allergy is performed. Some of the NMBAs (those derived from steroids) may induce a wheal-and-flare skin test response due to direct action on blood vessels. This has been confirmed by almost 50 percent of normal volunteers showing a positive skin response. Since skin tests may be used to document NMBAs as a cause of anaphylaxis, the false-positive rate with certain agents may result in an exaggeration of the risk, particularly if more concentrated solutions are used for intradermal testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, there may be epidemiologic differences between Europe and the United States that explain the difference. The use of cough suppressants containing pholcodine, available in many countries in Europe but not in the United States, may be associated with the development of IgE antibodies to pholcodine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suxamethonium and other NMBAs. Furthermore, NMBA-associated anaphylaxis is 10 times more common in Norway, a country in which pholcodine products are more commonly used, than in Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, other substances may lead to IgE sensitization to NMBAs and pholcodine, since in vitro IgE to pholcodine can be detected in the serum of patients in countries where pholcodine is not used, such as the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The NMBAs most commonly implicated are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> (also known as suxamethonium), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atracurium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vecuronium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pancuronium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mivacurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mivacurium</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisatracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisatracurium</a>. Atracurium can cause nonimmunologic release of histamine from mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and some other drugs with this property (metocurine and tubocurarine) were removed from the United States market. Mivacurium is seldom used. However, they are mentioned here because they may still be in use in other parts of the world.</p><p>Cross-reactivity has been documented among NMBAs, meaning that patients who react to one NMBA may react to others. This phenomenon has been most often reported with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pancuronium</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vecuronium</a> and with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> (suxamethonium) and gallamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The shared quaternary ammonium groups in all NMBAs may underlie this phenomenon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-management#H315537455\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management&quot;, section on 'Neuromuscular-blocking agents'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Testing for IgE-mediated reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing with NMBAs is not standardized. We begin with prick-puncture testing, performed as described above and accompanied by a positive and negative control. If there is no reaction to the drug, we then proceed to intradermal testing with concentrations no higher than those listed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>]. Some experts limit the number of tests by using undiluted NMBA for prick-puncture testing and using 1:100 dilution for initial intradermal testing.

The use of concentrations at the higher end of the range provides the clinician with more confidence that the drug is not the cause of the IgE-mediated reaction, although there is an increased risk of false-positive results. If the test is positive, we usually perform the test on control individuals (the clinician or associates) to be sure the positive is not a nonspecific irritant reaction.</p><p>In vitro assays for IgE specific to NMBAs are available in some countries, including the United States. Reported assays have up to 88 percent sensitivity but a false-positive rate of 5 to 10 percent.

If there is no alternative agent with a negative skin test, then the suspect agent could be used again following premedication with antihistamine and possibly glucocorticoid. However, many studies document that no premedication regimen can reliably prevent all or even most cases of IgE-dependent anaphylaxis, and the clinician should take all possible precautions to minimize the severity of a reaction (eg, lowest possible dose) and must be prepared to treat an adverse event.

Desensitization can be performed if the culprit antibiotic is required in the future and no acceptable alternative is available. Desensitization is a process by which temporary tolerance to an agent is achieved by administering progressively increasing doses, starting at a dose less than that required to provoke symptoms.</p><p>Antibiotic desensitization by the oral route is associated with fewer risks than intravenous desensitization and is therefore preferred if an oral preparation is available. However, even an oral challenge may require intensive care observation if the prior reaction was life-threatening.</p><p>Since many antibiotics do not have an oral formulation, antibiotic desensitizations are often administered intravenously in an intensive care setting under the supervision of an allergy specialist. The procedure is usually accomplished in a matter of hours. Desensitization protocols for penicillin are reviewed separately.

Most patients are able to tolerate repeat administration using these procedures. The use of desensitization protocols is an option for patients with recurrent reactions despite slower rates and premedication.

However, since the removal of Cremophor ER (polyethoxylated castor oil) as a solvent for many of these agents, the incidence of induction agent anaphylaxis has decreased significantly.</p><p>There are two types of induction agents: barbiturates (eg, thiopental and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methohexital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methohexital</a>) and nonbarbiturates (eg, benzodiazepines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>).

Therefore, every effort should be made to identify the responsible trigger, so that the patient is not restricted to receiving multiple second-line agents. Unfortunately, even a very thorough evaluation may reveal no evidence of allergy to one specific agent. In these cases, future management involves avoidance of high-risk agents and adherence to the general precautions discussed below. In other evaluations, a positive skin test result may be obtained to more than one agent, raising the possibility that one or more results are false-positives with regard to causality. This is a particular concern with the neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs) or opioids. Future use of alternate NMBAs with negative skin tests is likely safe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">General precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For any patient with a history of perioperative anaphylaxis, there are several general precautions which should be applied to future procedures requiring anesthesia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asthma should have respiratory symptoms as well-controlled as possible prior to receiving anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-blockers should be avoided, if possible, especially if the culprit agent could not be conclusively identified. Beta-blockers may increase the severity of anaphylaxis and reduce responsiveness to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>. However, some patients may have cardiovascular conditions for which beta-blockade is critical, and these cases require multidisciplinary consideration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis#H1096757966\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Acute diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Concurrent medications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may interfere with compensatory physiologic responses to anaphylaxis and exaggerate bradykinin-induced vascular changes, although these data are not robust. The decision to discontinue these medications prior to repeat anesthesia depends upon the severity of the reaction and on whether a specific cause could be implicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis#H1096757966\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Acute diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Concurrent medications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs that can cause direct histamine release from mast cells and basophils (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, quaternary NMBAs) should be administered as slowly as possible, particularly if they are infused in close temporal proximity to each other (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60805 \">table 1</a>). Drugs that do not have these properties (if available) should be given instead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative antibiotics should be administered slowly, with careful hemodynamic monitoring. When possible, loading or initial doses should be given prior to induction of anesthesia, while the patient is awake, and not concomitantly with multiple other anesthetic agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Verification that baseline total serum tryptase is not elevated may be helpful to identify subjects at increased risk of anaphylaxis due to clonal mast cell disorders (&gt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> or mastocytosis (&gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>. Additional precautions should be implemented in such individuals, as they are at increased risk of anaphylaxis in general. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic mastocytosis: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Preparation for medical and surgical procedures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternate forms of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternate forms of anesthesia have the potential advantage of avoiding the use of NMBAs and hypnotic induction agents. In addition, patients are awake and able to communicate symptoms, such as pruritus or dyspnea. However, these forms of anesthesia may not be appropriate for many surgeries.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local anesthesia or nerve blocks may be adequate in a few situations. If the patient has a history of reacting to local anesthetic agents, then skin testing and challenge can be performed in advance to the drug that will be used to ensure that there is no evidence of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy. Preservatives in some local anesthetic preparations can result in positive skin tests but very rarely cause anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic reactions to local anesthetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal or epidural anesthesia can be used for relatively minor surgeries below the diaphragm, although perioperative anaphylaxis has been reported in patients receiving these forms of anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The rate of recurrent reactions in patients who initially reacted during general anesthesia and later received spinal anesthesia is unstudied. In addition, the clinician should be mindful that the patient is essentially sympathectomized (below the level at which the anesthesia is introduced), reducing the baseline blood pressure and decreasing responsiveness to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and other sympathomimetic agents that would be needed if anaphylaxis were to recur. This is particularly concerning in cases in which a culprit drug could not be identified. Thus, the general precautions noted above must still be applied.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1405407455\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

If an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reaction is suspected or likely, skin testing or in vitro testing for allergen-specific IgE should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgE-mediated reactions are most common with neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs) (muscle relaxants), latex, antibiotics (particularly penicillins and cephalosporins), isosulfan blue, and barbiturate induction agents. Skin tests can be performed for each of these agents. Approved commercial preparations for penicillin skin testing, but not for any other drug listed, are available in the United States. Skin testing should be performed by allergy specialists. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Role of skin testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In vitro tests for allergen-specific IgE are available for latex and a very limited number of other agents (eg, penicillin and NMBAs in some countries). In vitro testing is generally less sensitive than skin testing. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Role of in vitro testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative anaphylaxis can result from more than one mechanism, and it is important to understand which mechanisms are associated with each agent, as well as what type of testing is relevant for that mechanism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60805 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Specific agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The safest management approach for a patient with past anaphylaxis is the definitive identification and complete avoidance of the trigger. If this is not possible or evaluation does not reveal a specific culprit, then future management is based upon avoidance of high-risk agents and implementation of general precautions. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Approach to future anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require repeat anesthesia, general precautionary measures include optimal preoperative control of asthma, slow administration of antibiotics and other high-risk agents, and avoidance (when possible) of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and drugs that cause direct histamine release from mast <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/basophils</span>.
