This is a normal physiologic process that occurs in healthy infants, children, and adults. Most episodes are brief and do not cause symptoms, esophageal injury, or other complications. In contrast, &quot;gastroesophageal reflux disease&quot; (GERD) is present when the reflux episodes are associated with complications or troublesome symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>The term &quot;regurgitate&quot; describes reflux to the oropharynx, and &quot;vomit&quot; describes expulsion of the refluxate out of the mouth, but not necessarily repetitively or with force. The terms are often used interchangeably in clinical practice. In this review, we will use the term &quot;regurgitate&quot; to describe obvious GER into the mouth, whether or not the refluxate is expelled from the mouth. Recurrent regurgitation and vomiting are often caused by GER, but occasionally are caused by more serious problems, including underlying anatomic, metabolic, or neurologic abnormalities, which should be considered when indicated by the patient's clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent vomiting or regurgitation'</a> below.)</p><p>The term &quot;rumination&quot; describes a separate phenomenon in which food is voluntarily regurgitated into the mouth, masticated, then reswallowed. This disorder should be considered as a possible cause of GER, but it has a behavioral etiology and treatment. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent vomiting or regurgitation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with nausea and vomiting&quot;, section on 'Rumination syndrome'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few large population-based studies have described the epidemiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in children. Most studies focus on the prevalence of GERD in specific groups. Comparison among studies is also limited by the use of different definitions of GERD and the variable extent to which other possible causes of symptoms that were attributed to GERD were investigated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to a large community-based study of children in the United States, the prevalence of various symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) was 1.8 to 8.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among adolescents, 3 to 5 percent complained of heartburn or epigastric pain, and 1 to 2 percent used antacids or acid-suppressing medication. The prevalence of GERD in adults in the western world is approximately 10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Contrary to previously held beliefs, GERD does not appear to be limited to western countries. The prevalence of GERD in children appears to be rising worldwide, although it is unclear whether the rise reflects increasing case identification, or increases in obesity or other conditions that promote GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Higher rates of GERD are seen among children with a history of prematurity, pulmonary diseases, developmental and neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy. Children with Down syndrome are also at increased risk for GERD and other esophageal motor abnormalities for reasons that are poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. These groups of children also appear to be at increased risk for developing respiratory complications related to GERD and represent a significant proportion of children referred for antireflux surgery. Complications of GERD, including Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, are more common in individuals who had repair of esophageal atresia in the perinatal period as compared with individuals without this congenital defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. GERD also appears to be relatively common in children with obesity or cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regurgitation in infants is common and typically decreases or resolves during the first year of life (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux in infants&quot;</a>). Although the problem usually resolves by the end of infancy, there is a weak association with GERD later in life. As an example, frequent regurgitation during infancy or a history of GERD in the mother (but not the father) predicts the risk of reflux-related symptoms during childhood. This was demonstrated in a prospective cohort study in which children who had more than 90 days of frequent regurgitation during the first two years of life were more likely to have heartburn around nine years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Symptoms of GERD during childhood may persist into adolescence and adulthood (&quot;tracking&quot;). In a survey of 207 patients who were diagnosed with GERD through an endoscopic examination showing esophagitis in childhood (mean age five years), about one-third had symptoms of significant GERD during early adulthood (approximately 15 years later) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. At least 9 (up to 23) percent had weekly symptoms of GER. Among those responding to the survey, 30 percent were currently taking acid-suppressing medications, and 24 percent had undergone fundoplication. Other studies have shown similar results, but the lack of prospective trials limits the reliability of these observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Several questions related to the epidemiology and natural history of GERD in children remain unanswered. We have only a partial understanding of the relationship between GER and respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic cough, and recurrent pneumonia. In addition, the relationship between childhood GERD and GERD-related complications in adulthood is unclear. Finally, the healthcare burden related to the diagnosis and treatment of childhood GERD and the impact of GERD on quality of life for children and their families have not been fully examined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) vary according to age, although overlap may exist.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants &ndash; GER is common in infants and usually is not pathological. Regurgitation is present in 50 to 70 percent of all infants, peaks at age four to six months, and typically resolves by one year. A small minority of infants with GER develop other symptoms suggestive of GERD, including irritability, feeding refusal, hematemesis, anemia, respiratory symptoms, and failure to thrive. The clinical manifestations and management of GER in this age group is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux in infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preschool &ndash; Preschool age children with GERD may present with intermittent regurgitation. Less commonly, they may have respiratory complications including persistent wheezing. Decreased food intake, poor weight gain, or food aversion without any other complaints may be a symptom in young children. All of these symptoms are nonspecific and insufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of GERD. A more specific symptom of GERD is Sandifer syndrome, an unusual posturing consisting of arching of the back, torsion of the neck, and lifting up of the chin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sandifer syndrome is found in typically-developing preschool-aged children, as well as those who are developmentally delayed, as in the original descriptions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-torticollis-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired torticollis in children&quot;, section on 'Sandifer syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>School-aged children and adolescents &ndash; The pattern of symptoms and complications of GERD in older children and adolescents resembles that seen in adults. The cardinal symptoms are chronic heartburn <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Complications of GERD, including esophagitis, strictures, Barrett esophagus, and hoarseness due to reflux-induced laryngitis, also may be seen. Older children may complain of nausea, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epigastric pain, but many pre-adolescents will not localize pain and report diffuse abdominal discomfort. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to chronic cough in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p>GERD-related chest pain is not well-described by young children. Young or nonverbal children may be observed pounding their chest. GERD is common in children with autism, and may be manifested only by unexplained or self-injurious behaviors. In older children, chest pain typically is described as squeezing or burning, located substernally sometimes radiating to the back, lasting from minutes to hours, and resolving either spontaneously or with antacids. It usually occurs after meals, awakens patients from sleep, and may be exacerbated by emotional stress.</p><p>Extraesophageal disorders that are associated with GERD also may be seen in older children and adolescents. In a large case-control study of children without neurologic defects, GERD was an independent risk factor for developing sinusitis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.3), laryngitis (OR 2.6), asthma (OR 1.9), pneumonia (OR 2.3), and bronchiectasis (OR 2.3) (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Asthma'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent pneumonia'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. GER is also hypothesized to contribute to otitis media with effusion, but causality has not been proven. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H320709115\"><span class=\"h1\">AVAILABLE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following sections summarize characteristics of the tests that are used to evaluate individuals with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The clinical approach to selecting among these tests depends on the patient's presenting characteristics. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Suggested approach for common clinical scenarios'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Empiric treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An empiric trial of acid suppression is often used as a diagnostic test, and is suggested for older children and adolescents with uncomplicated heartburn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The trial typically consists of a two- to four-week course of acid-suppressing medication (eg, a proton pump inhibitor [PPI]). An empiric trial of a PPI may not be a valuable diagnostic test in infants and young children, in whom symptoms of GERD are less specific; however, response after a two-week trial of a PPI has been used as inclusion criteria for clinical trials in infants with GER [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Studies in adults suggest that empiric treatment is a cost-effective approach in selected patients, although the applicability of these results to children is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

When compared with esophageal pH studies, barium studies of the esophagus have a sensitivity ranging from 31 to 86 percent, specificity of 21 to 83 percent, and positive predictive value of 80 to 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>].</p><p>Although radiologic evaluation is not useful to confirm or exclude GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,24</a>], imaging is useful in a young infant with intractable reflux, to identify congenital abnormalities such as an antral web, pyloric stenosis, annular pancreas, duodenal web, or malrotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Imaging may also be useful in the evaluation of selected patients with atypical presenting features, such as dysphagia or odynophagia, in whom it may identify hiatal hernia, Schatzki's ring, achalasia, or strictures associated with acid or eosinophilic esophagitis. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Dysphagia or odynophagia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy and histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract is indicated for selected patients in whom esophagitis or gastritis is suspected. These include children or adolescents with heartburn, hematemesis, or epigastric abdominal pain that fails to respond to or relapses quickly after empiric treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,24</a>]. In addition, endoscopy may be valuable in the evaluation of patients with recurrent regurgitation, dysphagia, odynophagia, or a history of food impaction, or in children with frequent GER that persisted from infancy until after two years of age. </p><p>At endoscopy, the examiner inspects the visual appearance of the esophageal mucosa and anatomy, and takes a series of biopsies for histologic examination. The findings help to determine the presence and severity of esophagitis and complications, such as strictures or Barrett esophagus, and to exclude other disorders such as eosinophilic, peptic, or infectious esophagitis. The diagnostic yield of endoscopy in children with symptoms suggesting GERD is not well established. In one large series of children undergoing endoscopy due to GERD symptoms, 35 percent were found to have erosive esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In another large series of children undergoing endoscopy for GER, only 13 percent had histologic evidence of esophagitis, whereas more than 50 percent of those undergoing endoscopy for dysphagia had gross and histologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Endoscopy can be performed safely in infants, toddlers, and older children. Procedure-related complications of diagnostic endoscopy and biopsy are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Complications requiring medical attention, including under- or over-sedation, occur in about 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The most common complication is transient sore throat or hoarseness, which occurs in about 35 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The endoscopy should include biopsies of the esophageal mucosa to evaluate for esophagitis, even if the esophagus appears normal on visual inspection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,31</a>]. Histologic abnormalities consistent with GERD include increased numbers of intraepithelial eosinophils, thickening of the basal cell layer, and elongation of the epithelial papillae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,32,33</a>]. In young children with esophagitis, the findings of basal zone hyperplasia are uncommon, and other histologic features, such as the presence of neutrophils and eosinophils, and dilated vascular channels in papillae of the lamina propria are more typically seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with reflux-associated esophagitis should be treated with acid suppression, as discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The histologic features described above are only moderately specific for GERD. In patients with markedly increased numbers of eosinophils in esophageal biopsies, the possibility of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) should be considered. EoE is a chronic immune-mediated disorder characterized by markedly increased intraepithelial eosinophils in greater numbers than noted in GERD. Symptoms of EoE and the number of intraepithelial eosinophils may not respond to acid suppression. EoE is increasingly recognized in children and adults, and the symptoms and histological findings overlap with those of GERD, such that in some cases it can be difficult clearly distinguish between the disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The number and distribution of eosinophils can help distinguish GERD from EoE. In children with GERD, the eosinophilic inflammation tends to be mild (&lt;15 eosinophils per high power field) and limited to the distal esophagus, whereas in children with EoE the inflammation tends to be severe (&gt;15 eosinophils per high power field) and located in the mid or proximal esophagus. In addition, many patients with EoE have a history of atopy or peripheral eosinophilia, and are more likely to fail to respond to antireflux treatment. Diagnostic and treatment approaches to patients with suspected EoE are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal pH monitoring or impedance monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal pH and multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) monitoring permits the assessment of the frequency and duration of esophageal acid exposure and its relationship to symptoms. However, the results may not correlate consistently with symptom severity, although there is a correlation with the presence of esophagitis on endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,33,36</a>]. Therefore, pH monitoring can raise or lower suspicion of GERD, but is not a definitive diagnostic test, and is not useful in many clinical situations, especially in infants. </p><p>To perform pH monitoring, a microelectrode attached to a small catheter is passed through the nose and positioned in the distal esophagus. The position can be verified radiologically. In special situations, multiple sensors can be used to determine if acid reflux extends into the proximal esophagus. There are also devices that clip to the esophageal mucosa and remain in place for 24 hours, to allow recording of intraesophageal pH without the transnasal catheter. This technology can be used for older children and is particularly beneficial for children with autism in whom transnasal pH monitoring is often difficult to perform.</p><p>The &quot;reflux index&quot; is defined as the percentage of total time that the esophageal pH is less than 4; this provides an estimate of the cumulative esophageal acid exposure, which is considered to be the most valid measure of reflux. However, there is only a weak correlation between the reflux index and clinical symptoms, presence of esophageal disease, or response to therapy, and results of esophageal pH monitoring should be interpreted in the context of other clinical information. The reflux index usually is interpreted as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants &ndash; Reflux index above 7 percent is considered abnormal, and between 3 and 7 percent is indeterminate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older children and adults &ndash; Upper limit of normal for the reflux index between 4 and 7 percent. </p><p/><p>Multichannel intraluminal impedance monitoring (MII) is a newer technique that permits measurement of all reflux episodes, including those that are acidic, weakly acidic and alkaline. MII is available at many centers, and usually is used in combination with pH monitoring so that episodes of acid reflux may be distinguished from non-acid reflux. In a trial comparing the two techniques, combined MII-pH monitoring detected reflux events that caused symptoms twice as often as pH monitoring alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Pill esophagitis is likely in patients who have sudden onset of odynophagia any time during the course of treatment with one of these drugs, especially if the pill is swallowed with little or no liquid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> taken just before bedtime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If the symptoms are mild, then it is reasonable to treat these patients empirically with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sucralfate</a> or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in addition to stopping the offending medication. If the symptoms are severe or progressive, it is important to perform an upper endoscopy prior to initiating treatment, to exclude infectious causes of esophagitis that cause odynophagia, including candida, cytomegalovirus, and herpes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-induced-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication-induced esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Uncommon causes of dysphagia that may present in children or adolescents include motility disorders (eg, myotonia) and systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80528\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80528 \">table 3</a>).

Abnormal reflux, as measured by symptoms or by esophageal pH monitoring, occurs in 25 to 75 percent of children with persistent asthma, and the association increases with severity of either condition, but whether this association is causal remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Many studies have shown clinical improvement in asthma when patients are treated for GER [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/49,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,51</a>]. However, predicting which patients are likely to respond to treatment remains problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,52</a>]. </p><p>For patients with asthma and symptoms that strongly suggest GERD (including heartburn in older children and adolescents, or chronic regurgitation or vomiting in infants and younger children), we suggest a three-month trial of acid suppression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>GER may trigger asthma in some patients even in the absence of symptoms of GERD. Therefore, many experts recommend esophageal pH or <span class=\"nowrap\">MII/pH</span> monitoring or an empiric three-month trial of vigorous acid suppression for patients with either of the following characteristics, particularly if they lack seasonal or allergic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nocturnal asthma more than once a week</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous requirement for oral corticosteroids, high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, more than two courses of oral corticosteroids per year, or persistent asthma that does not allow the patient to be weaned from medical management</p><p/><p>Similar approaches are used for adult patients with asthma and possible GERD.

Such patients should be evaluated for swallowing dysfunction using videofluoroscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. Esophageal pH monitoring has low sensitivity and specificity in detecting whether aspiration pneumonia is related to reflux in an individual patient, but may help establish the diagnosis in selected patients with suspected aspiration when combined with other investigations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other than direct evaluation of swallowing for patients with suspected swallowing dysfunction, no techniques are available to determine definitively whether GERD is causing chronic aspiration in an individual patient. Measurement of lipid-laden macrophages (obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage) and nuclear scintigraphy have been used for this purpose, but neither technique can reliably determine whether a patient has chronic aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

A history of choking is highly suggestive of foreign body aspiration, even if the choking occurred days or weeks prior to the onset of respiratory symptoms. An H-type tracheoesophageal fistula should also be considered in a child with recurrent pneumonia, especially if the same segment of the lung is always involved.

The regurgitation usually resolves by 18 months of age. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refers to GER that is associated with pathological complications. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in children is broad, particularly when the principal complaint is regurgitation, vomiting, or abdominal pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79114\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79114 \">table 1</a>). The diagnostic possibilities can be narrowed based upon the age of the child and the pattern of symptoms, using a thorough medical history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61174\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61174 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H320709715\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that are <strong>not</strong> typical for GERD include fever, weight loss or faltering growth, abdominal tenderness or distension, bilious vomiting, marked hematemesis, hepatosplenomegaly, headache or new neurologic symptoms, or other systemic symptoms. Patients with these symptoms should be carefully evaluated for other disorders. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent vomiting or regurgitation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that suggest the possibility of GERD include (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recurrent regurgitation that continues after two years of age</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Refusal of food, especially solids</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Frequent complaints of heartburn</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe or progressive asthma that is not responsive to standard therapy for asthma </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recurrent pneumonia, particularly in children with neurologic dysfunction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic hoarseness or stridor</p><p/><p>When children present with these symptoms, further workup is appropriate.

Persistent or recurrent symptoms should prompt referral for an upper endoscopy with biopsy, especially if any dysphagia is present. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Empiric treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract is indicated for patients with heartburn or epigastric abdominal pain that fails to respond to or relapses quickly after empiric treatment, or those with dysphagia or odynophagia. In addition, endoscopy may be valuable in the evaluation of patients who continue to have recurrent regurgitation after two years of age. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Suggested approach for common clinical scenarios'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopy and histology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic evaluation is necessary to establish the diagnosis of esophagitis.

In children with odynophagia (painful swallowing), diagnostic endoscopy should be performed rather than empiric treatment with acid suppression due to the possibility of infectious esophagitis. An esophageal motility study is helpful in diagnosing primary motility disorders such as achalasia.
