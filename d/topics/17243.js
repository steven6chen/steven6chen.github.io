Thyroid nodules are round or oval-shaped areas within the thyroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76248 \">figure 2</a>) that can be caused by a number of conditions, most of which are not serious.</p><p>This topic discusses the tests that may be performed on thyroid nodules, as well as the treatments that are available. Other thyroid conditions are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithyroid-drugs-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Antithyroid drugs (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT DOES THE THYROID DO?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thyroid produces two hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), which regulate how the body uses and stores energy. Thyroid function is controlled by a gland located just below the brain, known as the pituitary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63094\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63094 \">figure 3</a>). The pituitary produces thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which stimulates the thyroid to produce T3 and T4.</p><p>Thyroid nodules are very common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76248 \">figure 2</a>); up to half of all people have at least one thyroid nodule, although most do not know about it. Thyroid nodules can be caused by many different conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51803\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51803 \">table 1</a>). Reassuringly, approximately 95 percent of all thyroid nodules are caused by benign (noncancerous) conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROID NODULE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic tests can determine if a thyroid nodule is benign or malignant (cancerous); this information can help to guide treatment decisions. There are several diagnostic tests, and each provides unique information about the thyroid nodule. However, not every person with a thyroid nodule needs all of these tests.</p><p>Often, a test will provide a definitive answer about the type and cause of a nodule. In other cases, a test may be inconclusive, and further testing will be required. Discuss which tests you will need and the results of these tests with your health care provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid-stimulating hormone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) can be measured with a blood test.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the TSH level is normal, the next step is to have a thyroid ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H23393801\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid ultrasound'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Fine-needle aspiration'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low levels of thyroid TSH in the blood may indicate that a nodule is producing high levels of thyroid hormone. If the TSH level is lower than normal, the next step is to have a thyroid scan. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid scan'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High levels of TSH may indicate autoimmune inflammation of the thyroid (called Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Another blood test, to measure levels of thyroid antibodies, is sometimes recommended in this case (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis)&quot;</a>). An FNA biopsy may also be needed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23393801\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thyroid ultrasound should be performed in all patients with a suspected thyroid nodule or nodular goiter on physical examination or with nodules incidentally noted on other imaging studies (carotid ultrasound, computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or positron emission tomography [PET] scan). Thyroid ultrasonography is used to answer questions about the size and anatomy of the thyroid gland and nearby structures in the neck and the characteristics of the nodule. Thyroid ultrasound findings can be used to select nodules that require FNA biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Fine-needle aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the TSH level is normal, and the next step is FNA. FNA uses a thin needle to remove small tissue samples from the thyroid nodule. The tissue is examined with a microscope.</p><p>FNA biopsy can be performed in the office with a local anesthetic (numbing medicine). It can be performed by palpation or using ultrasound guidance. You may feel mild discomfort as the anesthesia is injected, and you may feel some pressure during the biopsy, but the level of discomfort is similar to a visit with the dentist.</p><p>This test is accurate in identifying cancer in a suspicious thyroid nodule. In some cases, the biopsy does not contain enough tissue to make a diagnosis, and a repeat biopsy is necessary. In other cases (15 percent), the result of the biopsy is indeterminate. Indeterminate means that the findings are not clearly benign or malignant, the risk of malignancy is low, and further testing may be advised. Surgery may be recommended for indeterminate nodules for a definite diagnosis. In some cases, assessment of molecular markers on the needle aspirates is used to select low-risk, indeterminate nodules for observation rather than surgery.</p><p>The results of the biopsy will be one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign (noncancerous).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant (cancer).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspicious for malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follicular neoplasm (microfollicular nodules, including H&uuml;rthle cell lesions). This is considered an indeterminate biopsy and requires further evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follicular lesion or atypia of undetermined significance (nodules with atypical cells). This is considered an indeterminate biopsy and requires further evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nondiagnostic or insufficient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people do not have to have a thyroid scan, only those who have a low TSH level. In these cases, the thyroid scan is the first step after the blood test (instead of the FNA).</p><p>A thyroid scan can help to determine if a thyroid nodule is autonomous (&quot;hot&quot;) or nonfunctional (&quot;cold&quot;). The scan is performed after taking a small dose of a radioactive iodine (a pill); technetium scans may also be used (an injection), but they are less reliable.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid nodules that absorb the radioiodine are usually <strong>not</strong> cancerous (called autonomous, hot, or toxic). (See <a href=\"#H23394399\" class=\"local\">'Autonomous (&quot;hot&quot;) thyroid nodules'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid nodules that do not absorb the radioiodine are called cold and have a 5 percent risk of being cancerous. Approximately 95 percent of thyroid nodules are cold.</p><p/><p>The risk of exposure to radiation is small compared with the benefit of knowing the test results. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not have a thyroid scan. Following a thyroid scan, patients should take care to flush the toilet and wash their hands after urinating because the radioactive substance is eliminated in the urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROID NODULE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriate thyroid nodule treatment depends upon the type of thyroid nodule that is found. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign thyroid nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign thyroid nodules usually develop as a result of overgrowth of normal thyroid tissue. Surgery is <strong>not</strong> usually recommended, and the thyroid nodule can be monitored over time. If the thyroid nodule grows, a repeat biopsy or surgery may be recommended. Some surgeons recommend excision of nodules over 4 cm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Suppressive (thyroid hormone) treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a thyroid nodule is not cancerous, but the nodule is large, some clinicians will suggest a trial of thyroid hormone (thyroxine [T4]) to shrink the nodule; this is called suppressive treatment. The American Thyroid Association guidelines do not recommend this treatment, because only a small percentage of nodules shrink, and suppressive therapy may have side effects. Thyroid hormone levels should be monitored carefully during suppressive treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid hormone suppressive therapy for thyroid nodules and benign goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant thyroid nodules (thyroid cancer)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only approximately 5 percent of all thyroid nodules are malignant. Most patients with thyroid cancer have an excellent chance for cure or long-term survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=follicular-thyroid-cancer-including-hurthle-cell-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Follicular thyroid cancer (including H&uuml;rthle cell cancer)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=papillary-thyroid-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Papillary thyroid cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of thyroid cancer will depend on the type of cancer. Thyroid cancers require surgical removal of the thyroid gland and sometimes one or more treatments with radioiodine, followed by thyroid hormone (T4) suppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23394482\"><span class=\"h2\">Suspicious for malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nodules in this category have a 50 to 75 percent risk of malignancy. Patients with nodules that are suspicious for malignancy frequently have a lobectomy or a total thyroidectomy because the chance that the nodule is a cancer is higher than the chance it is benign.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23394490\"><span class=\"h2\">Follicular neoplasm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We frequently perform a thyroid scan in patients with biopsies that show follicular neoplasm, especially when the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is in the lower portion of the normal range. From 15 to 20 percent of follicular neoplasms prove to be cancer. Thus, if the scan shows a cold nodule, surgical removal (usually a hemithyroidectomy) is generally recommended. Molecular markers (assessed on the fine-needle aspirate) are frequently used to select low-risk nodules for observation rather than surgery. Most of these tests, if negative, are still associated with a 5 to 6 percent risk of cancer, while, if positive, the risk of cancer exceeds 45 percent, depending on the test used. Thyroid nodules that absorb the radioiodine (autonomous or &quot;hot&quot; nodule) are usually <strong>not</strong> cancerous, and treatment depends upon thyroid function tests and other factors. (See <a href=\"#H23394399\" class=\"local\">'Autonomous (&quot;hot&quot;) thyroid nodules'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23394497\"><span class=\"h2\">Follicular lesion or atypia of undetermined significance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who have nodules with atypical cells require repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA). The optimal treatment depends upon patient factors, such as risk for thyroid cancer, and the FNA (including molecular testing) and ultrasound features of the nodule. Molecular markers are frequently used to select low-risk nodules for observation rather than surgery. Most of these tests, if negative, are still associated with a 5 percent risk of malignancy, while, if positive, the risk of cancer exceeds 45 percent, depending on the test used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23394353\"><span class=\"h2\">Nondiagnostic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A nondiagnostic biopsy does not have enough cells for interpretation. It should not be considered a negative biopsy. For patients with nondiagnostic FNA biopsies, the FNA should be repeated using ultrasound guidance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23394399\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomous (&quot;hot&quot;) thyroid nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some thyroid nodules produce thyroid hormone, similar to the thyroid gland, but do not respond to the body's hormonal controls. These nodules are called autonomous thyroid nodules. They are almost always benign, but they can overproduce thyroid hormone, leading to hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If you have an autonomous nodule and high levels of thyroid hormone, you will usually be advised to undergo surgery to remove the thyroid nodule, or undergo radioactive iodine treatment to destroy the nodule. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If you have an autonomous nodule and normal thyroid function or minimal hyperthyroidism, the appropriate treatment will depend on your age and other health factors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In young adults, autonomous nodules may be monitored over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In older adults, radioactive iodine treatment or surgery may be recommended because high thyroid hormone levels pose a risk of an abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) and bone loss (osteoporosis).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23394427\"><span class=\"h2\">Cystic thyroid nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystic thyroid nodules are usually benign nodules that have filled with fluid. These nodules may simply collapse when the fluid is removed. Cystic nodules are usually monitored for changes. If the cyst reforms or bleeds more than once, surgery can be performed to remove the thyroid nodule. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-thyroid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic thyroid nodules&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the middle of the neck, located below the larynx (voice box) and above the clavicles (collarbones).
