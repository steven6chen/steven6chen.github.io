Although an uncommon occurrence in children, it is nevertheless a disturbing finding for both the affected child and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> family.</p><p>The causes and evaluation of gross hematuria in children will be reviewed here. The evaluation of children with microscopic hematuria is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-microscopic-hematuria-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of microscopic hematuria in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONFIRMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gross hematuria is suspected when red or brown urine is present. However, red or brown urine can be due to causes other than blood including the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56337\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56337 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pigments from drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenazopyridine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenazopyridine</a>, rifampicin) or foods (eg, beets)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolites associated with other clinical conditions (eg, porphyria)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free hemoglobin or myoglobin</p><p/><p>Thus, the initial step in the evaluation of patients with red urine is to establish whether or not the urine discoloration is due to blood or another substance. This is accomplished by the following two procedures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary dipstick test for blood &ndash; The reagent strip that detects blood utilizes hydrogen peroxide, which catalyzes a chemical reaction between hemoglobin (or myoglobin) and the chromogen tetramethylbenzidine. If the urinary dipstick test is positive for blood, the likely cause of the <span class=\"nowrap\">red/brown</span> pigmentation is blood, or free hemoglobin or myoglobin. A negative test eliminates these etiologies as the cause of urinary discoloration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine centrifugation &ndash; If after centrifugation of the urine specimen the sediment is <span class=\"nowrap\">red/brown,</span> then the etiology is most likely blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55923\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55923 \">algorithm 1</a>). If the supernatant is <span class=\"nowrap\">red/brown</span> and the sediment is not discolored, then the <span class=\"nowrap\">red/brown</span> urine is not due to blood but to another substance, such as free hemoglobin or myoglobin. Microscopic examination of the sediment should confirm the presence of red blood cells (RBCs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Red to brown urine'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In patients with gross hematuria, the color change does not necessarily reflect the degree of blood loss, since as little as 1 mL of blood per liter of urine can induce a visible color change.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly identified etiologies for gross hematuria in children include urinary tract infection (UTI), irritation of the meatus or perineum, and trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Other less common causes include nephrolithiasis, sickle cell <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/trait,</span> coagulopathy, glomerular disease including postinfectious glomerulonephritis and immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, malignancies (eg, Wilms tumor and rarely, transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder), and drug-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, such as is seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Post-micturition urethral bleeding, a benign condition, may also be seen in infant boys with resolution by one year of age in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The relative frequency of the known causes of gross hematuria in children varies depending upon the clinical setting. This is illustrated by several case series of children with gross hematuria who presented to three different clinical settings (ie, a pediatric emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], a pediatric urology referral service [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], or a pediatric nephrology referral service [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]).</p><p>In a 1977 two-year retrospective review of 150 patients presenting to a tertiary pediatric emergency center with gross hematuria, either documented (n = 39) or suspected (n = 35) UTI was the underlying diagnosis in half of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other causes included perineal or urethral irritation (18 percent), trauma (7 percent), acute nephritis (4 percent), coagulopathy (3 percent), and stone (2 percent). In 10 percent of patients, no etiology was found.</p><p>In a 10-year retrospective review of 342 children who presented with gross hematuria to a pediatric urologic center in the United States between 1994 and 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], the causes of gross hematuria and their frequency included urethral irritation or trauma (15 percent), UTI (14 percent), underlying congenital anomalies such as vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), posterior urethral valves (PUV), or ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) (13 percent), nephrolithiasis (5 percent), and malignancy (1 percent). In 35 percent of the patients, no cause could be determined. In addition, bladder or urethral abnormalities were seen in 76 of 136 patients who underwent cystoscopy including posterior urethritis (n = 25), cystitis (n = 25), bladder trabeculation (n = 7), and urethral stricture (n = 6).</p><p>In this urologic case series, there were no cases of glomerular disease, which is most likely due to referral bias. This was illustrated by the third retrospective case series from a pediatric nephrology referral center that demonstrated a greater proportion of cases due to glomerular disease compared with both of the two previous studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this review, results were based upon 82 of 100 patients with completed evaluation. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A glomerular cause was identified in 24 patients (29 percent). The two most common diagnoses were IgA nephropathy (n = 13) and Alport syndrome (n = 6). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of IgA nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, pathogenesis, and pathology of Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonglomerular etiology was established in 30 patients (37 percent). The most common diagnoses were hypercalciuria (n = 9), urethral irritation or trauma (n = 8), and hemorrhagic cystitis (n = 7).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No cause was found in the remaining 28 patients (34 percent). In 26 of these patients, the hematuria was attributed to a nonglomerular source.</p><p/><p>In the two referral-based studies, boys were at a higher risk for gross hematuria than girls because of their increased susceptibility to trauma of the urethral meatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, in the first study, there was no gender difference. The increased prevalence of female patients with gross hematuria due to urinary tract infections seen in the emergency department setting appears to have offset the predominance of boys with recurrent gross hematuria due to trauma, resulting in the reported equal distribution of boys and girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of children who present with gross hematuria have an easily recognizable and apparent cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-gross-hematuria-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The clinician generally is able to establish the underlying etiology by a complete history, physical examination, and urinalysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68294\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68294 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Historical clues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are often clues from the history that point toward a specific diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent vigorous exercise or trauma.

In comparison, flank pain without radiation but with fever, dysuria, and frequency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urgency is suggestive of acute pyelonephritis.

As an example, initial hematuria (onset of urination) usually suggests urethral bleeding; continuous bleeding throughout urination may occur from bleeding in the bladder, ureter or kidneys; and terminal bleeding (at the end of urination) is indicative of bladder disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The color of urine may distinguish glomerular bleeding from extraglomerular bleeding. Glomerulonephritis is associated with brown urine. Bleeding from the lower urinary tract is suggested by pink or red urine and may be accompanied by blood clots.

In a first morning urinary sample, protein excretion greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> at a time when there is no gross bleeding is also indicative of glomerular source of blood. Although helpful if present, the absence of these findings does not exclude glomerular disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Morphologic study of urinary red blood cells (RBCs), particularly with a phase-contrast microscope, may be helpful in distinguishing glomerular from nonglomerular bleeding. The presence of more than 30 percent dysmorphic RBCs or of more than 5 percent of a specific form named an &quot;acanthocyte&quot; is highly suggestive of glomerular hematuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79440%7ENEPH%2F62064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79440 graphicRef62064 \">picture 2A-B</a>).
