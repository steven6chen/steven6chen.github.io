People with an object stuck up the nose usually have no symptoms. If people do have symptoms, they can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing through the nostril with the object in it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bad-smelling fluid draining out of the nose</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13620978\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I remove an object stuck up my child's nose on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Do not try to grab or pull out an object that is stuck up your child's nose. If you do, you might push the object deeper into the nose or push it to the back of the nose. From the back of the nose, the object can fall into and get stuck in the wind pipe. Or your child might breathe it into his or her lungs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56535\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56535 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13620993\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to help my child on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can have your child try to blow the object out of his or her nose. To do this:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the nostril without the object closed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child blow air out of the nostril that has the object in it</p><p/><p>If the object comes out, your child's nose might bleed for a short time. To stop the bleeding, gently pinch the end of the nose closed for 10 minutes. You can also put a cold pack on the nose or cheeks. If your child's nose is bleeding, do not tilt his or her head back. Tilting the head back does not stop a nosebleed and could make your child swallow blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13621008\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my child's doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Call the doctor or nurse right away.</p><p>If your child can't blow the object out of his or her nose, the doctor or nurse will need to remove it. Depending on the object and other factors, the doctor or nurse might be able to remove the object in the office. If not, he or she will have you go to the emergency room or to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor to have it removed. Batteries (such as button or disc batteries) and beads usually need to be removed in the emergency room.</p><p>Even if your child blew the object out of his or her nose, you will still need to see the doctor or nurse. He or she will do an exam and check that no other objects are in your child's nose or ears. (Children sometimes put objects in their ears, too.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13621023\"><span class=\"h1\">How will the doctor or nurse remove the object?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The doctor or nurse can use different tools to look inside the nose and remove the object. Before he or she removes the object, he or she might put drops in the nose to numb the nose and reduce swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13621038\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need any other treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Objects that are stuck in the nose for a long time can sometimes cause a sinus infection. The sinuses are hollow areas in the bones of the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75045 \">figure 2</a>). If your child has a sinus infection, he or she might need to take antibiotic medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13621053\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nosebleeds-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nosebleeds (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=removing-objects-stuck-in-the-ear-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Removing objects stuck in the ear (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nosebleeds-epistaxis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nosebleeds (epistaxis) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
