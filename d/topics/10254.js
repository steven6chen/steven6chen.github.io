The longer-acting preparations have been prescribed with increasing frequency. According to recommendations from the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) members, calcium channel blockers are a recommended choice for initial management of hypertension, either as monotherapy or as part of antihypertensive combination therapy. There are robust data suggesting that their use reduces the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, some meta-analyses have suggested that calcium channel blockers may be more effective than other drugs in reducing stroke risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A review of the major side effects associated with these agents and the controversy concerning their effect on coronary events, mortality, gastrointestinal bleeding, and the development of cancer are presented here. The management of calcium channel intoxication is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium channel blocker poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While all approved calcium channel blockers inhibit the L-type calcium channel on cells, they are divided into two major categories based upon their predominant physiologic effects: the dihydropyridines, which are predominantly vasodilators and generally have chronotropic and inotropic effects, and the non-dihydropyridines, which are less potent vasodilators and also slow cardiac contractility and conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dihydropyridines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dihydropyridines, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isradipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isradipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">felodipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nisoldipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nisoldipine</a>, lacidipine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>, are potent vasodilators that have little or no negative effect upon cardiac contractility or conduction. They are typically used to treat hypertension and chronic stable angina. Different agents and preparations have different durations of action. Longer-acting agents are generally safer and are increasingly preferred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-dihydropyridines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The non-dihydropyridines, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, are used in the management of hypertension, chronic stable angina, cardiac arrhythmias, and for proteinuria reduction. They are somewhat less potent vasodilators compared with dihydropyridines, but they have a greater depressive effect on cardiac conduction and contractility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-cardiac-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium channel blockers in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H79963019\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Calcium channel blockers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential adverse effects that may be seen with calcium channel blockers vary with the type and dose:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dihydropyridines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">felodipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>) may lead to headache, lightheadedness, flushing, and peripheral edema in up to 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major potential adverse effects with the non-dihydropyridines (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>) are constipation, which may occur in as many as 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], as well as bradycardia and worsening cardiac output. Thus, these drugs are relatively contraindicated in patients who are taking beta blockers or who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), sick sinus syndrome, and second- or third-degree atrioventricular block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, both dihydropyridines and non-dihydropyridines can lead to gingival hyperplasia in some cases.</p><p/><p>In general, the adverse effects of calcium channel blockers are dose dependent, so a decrease in dose is a possible way to improve tolerability. Patients who do not tolerate dihydropyridines may tolerate a change to non-dihydropyridines and vice versa. Non-dihydropyridines and, to a lesser extent, dihydropyridines are metabolized through the cytochrome P450 3A4 system (like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a>), and, as such, they should be used with caution in patients who are prescribed other agents that affect this metabolic pathway or who consume large amounts of grapefruit juice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The peripheral edema associated with calcium channel blockers is related to redistribution of fluid from the vascular space into the interstitium. In theory, increased calcium channel blocker-mediated vasodilation leads to increased pressure and subsequent permeability in the capillary circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In one study of 12 healthy subjects, for example, a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> increased the foot volume despite also increasing sodium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The risk of edema is more common with dihydropyridines than with non-dihydropyridines and appears to be dose dependent. Risk of edema is two to three times higher with higher than with lower doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Since calcium channel blocker-mediated edema is not the result of increased plasma volume, it tends not to improve with diuretic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Conversely, addition of an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of edema caused by calcium channel blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. This effect is probably related to ACE inhibitor- or ARB-mediated venodilation that helps to reduce transcapillary pressure.</p><p>As such, edema caused by dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be treated by any combination of the following: reduction in dose, switch to a non-dihydropyridine agent, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> addition of a RAS-blocking agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on cardiac function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, can diminish cardiac contractility and slow cardiac conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As a result, these drugs are relatively contraindicated in patients who are taking beta blockers or who have HFrEF, sick sinus syndrome, and second- or third-degree atrioventricular block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Use in heart failure and coronary artery disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to their negative inotropic effects, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should not be used in patients with HFrEF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-channel-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium channel blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, it does appear that these agents can be used safely in patients who have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and they may also be used in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic stable angina. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-non-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the non-acute management of ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Calcium channel blockers'</a>.)</p><p>Use of short-acting dihydropyridines has been demonstrated to cause reflex tachycardia and an increase in sympathetic tone, which may lead to poor outcomes in patients with heart failure and coronary disease. As such, these short-acting agents are generally no longer commercially available. However, the long-acting dihydropyridines (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">felodipine</a>) appear to be safe when used in patients with coronary artery disease or heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93142750\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPOSED BUT UNPROVEN SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several serious adverse effects have been ascribed to calcium channel blockers, although the data supporting these links are weak and inconclusive:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI) with short-acting but <strong>not</strong> long-acting agents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased risk for acute MI in hypertensive patients taking short-acting but <strong>not</strong> long-acting agents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased risk of cancer, particularly breast cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage</p><p/><p>Short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should generally be avoided.

The potential for harm from the profound hypotension and sympathetic activation induced by such large doses of short-acting nifedipine is incontrovertible in these hemodynamically vulnerable patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52312\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52312 \">table 1</a>). Thus, there is no compelling reason to use short-acting calcium channel blockers in such patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Possible increased risk for acute myocardial infarction with short-acting agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A highly publicized observational study from 1995 suggested that calcium channel blockers increased the risk for an acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Further review suggests that this risk, if it exists, is pertinent only to short-acting dihydropyridines. Multiple randomized, controlled trials involving thousands of hypertensive patients have since found no evidence of increased coronary risk from long-acting calcium channel blockers that do not share the possible harmful cardiovascular effects of the short-acting preparations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52312\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52312 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18674251\"><span class=\"h3\">Possible increased cancer risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some observational studies suggest an association, the balance of data does <strong>not</strong> support an increased cancer risk among those exposed to calcium channel blockers.</p><p>Several observational studies have found an association between calcium channel blockers and an increased risk of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>], particularly breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a retrospective, case-control study, for example, current and prior use of antihypertensive medications were ascertained from 1907 women diagnosed with breast cancer plus 856 women without breast cancer who were randomly selected from the phone book [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although the use of calcium channel blockers for less than 10 years was not associated with cancer, a subgroup analysis revealed an increased risk of breast cancer among women who used calcium channel blockers for 10 or more years. However, because of the methodologic limitations of this and other observational studies, a causal link between calcium channel blockers and cancer cannot be established based upon these data.</p><p>By contrast, a large meta-analysis of antihypertensive medication trials that included more than 300,000 individuals found that calcium channel blockers did not increase the incidence of cancer (odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% CI 0.96-1.13) or cancer-related mortality (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82-1.11), although the risk of breast cancer, per se, was not analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Additionally, a large, population-based study in the United Kingdom demonstrated no increased risk of overall cancer or breast cancer among people exposed to calcium channel blockers, regardless of duration of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Possible increased gastrointestinal bleeding risk in older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previous observational studies have suggested a possible increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with calcium channel blocker use, particularly among older adults. However, these data have not been confirmed in most subsequent reports, including in large, randomized trials and meta-analyses.</p><p>As an example, in a retrospective analysis of approximately 1000 hypertensive patients among a total of 8000 older adult individuals screened as part of a three-community epidemiologic study, a higher rate of gastrointestinal hemorrhage was observed in those taking short-acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, but not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In addition, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 clinical trials demonstrated, at most, a marginal association between calcium channel use and gastrointestinal bleeding, which did not appear to be of important clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-and-safety-of-calcium-channel-blockers/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
