The appearance of a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia following a myocardial infarction, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), in the early period post-MI may be the harbinger of ongoing myocardial ischemia, the development of pro-arrhythmic myocardial scar tissue, elevated sympathetic tone or increase in circulating catecholamines, or an electrolyte disturbance such as hypokalemia. In-hospital mortality approaches 20 percent or more in patients who develop VT or VF following a myocardial infarction. As such, rapid identification and treatment of these arrhythmias can be life-saving. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Because of the marked increase in mortality associated with ventricular arrhythmias following a myocardial infarction, many researchers have focused on ways to prevent ventricular arrhythmias in the early post-MI period. This topic will focus on prophylaxis against ventricular arrhythmias following myocardial infarction (MI), primarily focusing on the appropriate use or non-use of antiarrhythmic medications. Treatment for established ventricular arrhythmias in the post-MI patient, using defibrillation with or without antiarrhythmic medications, is discussed separately.

The clinical significance of different types of ventricular ectopy following myocardial infarction also varies markedly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11046305\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular premature beats</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular premature beats (VPBs), which are typically asymptomatic, are common after acute MI with a reported incidence as high as 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The early occurrence of VPBs does not predict short- or long-term mortality, but frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multiform VPBs that persist more than 48 to 72 hours after an MI may be associated with an increased long-term arrhythmic risk. Also of importance early after an acute MI are R-on-T VPBs. The pathogenesis of VPBs after MI and issues related to VPBs in patients with a prior MI are discussed separately.

In the first 24 to 48 hours after MI, NSVT is usually due to transient abnormalities of automaticity or triggered activity in the region of ischemia or infarction; in comparison, NSVT that occurs later is more often due to reentry and permanent arrhythmic substrate. However, the incidence and prognostic significance of NSVT appear lower with contemporary primary percutaneous reperfusion therapies.

In the early stage of an evolving infarction (ie, within 48 hours of onset), SMVT may result from transient arrhythmogenic phenomena in ischemic and infarcting tissue, such as abnormal automaticity, triggered activity, and reentrant circuits created by heterogeneous conduction and repolarization. SMVT occurring later than 48 hours is considered a marker of permanent arrhythmic substrate (scar and hence scar-mediated) and is associated with an increased long-term risk of arrhythmia recurrence and sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

However, there have been mixed results regarding the mortality impact of intravenous beta blockers in the early postinfarction period. Pooled data from controlled trials involving over 29,000 patients undergoing early, short-term intravenous administration of a beta blocker demonstrated a 13 percent reduction in acute mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Additionally, the majority of these studies centered on the suppression of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) with class I antiarrhythmic drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 1</a>), a strategy which actually led to increases in mortality associated with many of the antiarrhythmic drugs. The increase in mortality was attributed to asystole which resulted from the development of complete heart block in some of these patients and the suppression of an escape ventricular focus due to the antiarrhythmic drug. Subsequent studies evaluating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, a class III antiarrhythmic, have shown a decrease in ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death post-MI but no improvement in overall mortality.</p><p>We do not administer prophylactic antiarrhythmic agents in the post infarction period. The use of these agents is reserved for patients with documented ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The rationale for this approach is described in the following sections.

Although this practice decreases ventricular premature beats (VPBs), randomized trials demonstrated that there was an <strong>increase</strong> in deaths due to arrhythmia.

More than 20 randomized trials have evaluated prophylactic lidocaine in this setting. Although lidocaine was effective in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>], others failed to show benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. In a meta-analysis, lidocaine therapy was associated with nonsignificant trends toward reduced VF (odds ratio 0.71) but increased mortality (odds ratio 1.12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The increased mortality could be attributed to asystole as a result of suppression of an escape ventricular rhythm that occurs if complete heart block developed.

Data from an initial small trial and a 1993 meta-analysis suggested that amiodarone reduced ventricular arrhythmias and may have reduced mortality after MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,24</a>]. The benefit of early administration of amiodarone, especially when given intravenously, may be related to its beta blocking effect. The role of chronic oral amiodarone therapy in post-MI patients with ventricular premature beats (VPBs) was more completely assessed in the Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Arrhythmia Trial (CAMIAT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. While arrhythmia suppression was greater and risk of arrhythmic death was lower in patients treated with amiodarone, there was no significant difference in overall survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs-for-ventricular-arrhythmias-in-patients-with-a-prior-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of antiarrhythmic drugs for ventricular arrhythmias in patients with a prior myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The European Myocardial Infarct <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> Trial (EMIAT) evaluated amiodarone in post-MI patients with left ventricular ejection fraction below 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Similar to the results from CAMIAT, patients in EMIAT treated with amiodarone had a significant reduction in arrhythmic death, but not in overall mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Similar findings were noted in an analysis of eight trials that included over 5000 patients with a prior MI: amiodarone therapy was associated with a significant 35 percent reduction in <span class=\"nowrap\">arrhythmic/sudden</span> death, and a nonsignificant 8 percent reduction in total mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55922\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55922 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The effectiveness of amiodarone was not influenced by left ventricular ejection fraction, NYHA class, or the presence of asymptomatic arrhythmias on Holter monitoring.</p><p>Unlike the other antiarrhythmic drugs, prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is not associated with an increase in mortality. However, its unselected use in all patients does not appear to improve outcomes. As such, we do not administer prophylactic amiodarone in the post-MI period. Instead, we reserve its use in the postinfarction period for patients who have <strong>symptomatic</strong> VPBs or sustained ventricular arrhythmias that require antiarrhythmic drug therapy. In this population, amiodarone is likely to be effective and does not appear to increase mortality. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29883324\"><span class=\"h2\">Device therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with moderate-to-severe or severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction post-MI are at increased risk for developing ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) even in the absence of in-hospital arrhythmia. Such patients may benefit from the use of a wearable (vest) defibrillator prior to evaluation for possible permanent ICD implantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60103\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60103 \">picture 1</a>). Patients with an ejection fraction of 35 percent or less may eventually meet <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/HRS</span> guideline-based criteria for prophylactic ICD implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-against-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-and-after-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These guidelines, however, recommend a 40-day waiting period post-MI prior to prophylactic implantation of an ICD to allow for possible recovery of ventricular function. Additionally, many payers will not reimburse for prophylactic ICD implantation prior to re-assessment of systolic function at 40 days post-MI. As such, the wearable (vest) defibrillator can provide highly efficacious and definitive treatment for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during this time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wearable cardioverter-defibrillator&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Initial studies suggest that electrophysiologic (EP) testing with programmed ventricular stimulation may allow for risk stratification for ICD placement in the early post-MI patient without prior sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Further investigation in a randomized clinical trial is warranted to confirm the utility of EP testing early post-MI.

However, frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multiform VPBs that persist more than 48 to 72 hours after an MI may be associated with an increased long-term arrhythmic risk. It is unknown whether VPBs play a role in the initiation of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and attempts to decrease the frequency of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias by suppressing VPBs have resulted in increased mortality. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of ventricular arrhythmias'</a> above.)</p><p>The prophylactic administration of class Ic antiarrhythmic agents (eg, encainide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>) in the post-MI period is associated with increased mortality.

Instead, we reserve its use in the post-MI period for patients with <strong>symptomatic</strong> VPBs that require antiarrhythmic drug therapy. We prefer amiodarone to other antiarrhythmic agents in this setting because it has not been associated with increased mortality. (See <a href=\"#H31035829\" class=\"local\">'Amiodarone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The immediate administration of beta blockers is a standard part of the treatment of acute MI.
