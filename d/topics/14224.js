However, the data should be viewed as preliminary and hypothesis-generating, and not definitive. An adequately powered phase III trial with rigorous assessment of neurotoxicity by both clinicians and patients using standardized and validated neuropathy rating scales is needed before it can be concluded that exercise reduces either the frequency or severity of CIPN. Nevertheless, given the myriad benefits associated with exercise, including its potential to mitigate CIPN, it is reasonable to suggest exercise to patients receiving potentially neurotoxic chemotherapy.</p><p>There are some encouraging preliminary reports suggesting a potential protective effective of exercise on CIPN:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An early trial, in which 61 patients undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma were assigned to chemotherapy alone or with a 36-week intervention of sensorimotor, endurance, and strength training twice a week, concluded that exercise was associated with significantly improved quality of life (the primary endpoint), significantly reduced peripheral neuropathy-related deep sensitivity (as assessed by blinded application of a tuning fork to the metatarsophalangeal and malleolus medialis by the clinician), and a better activity level and balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A potential benefit for exercise to prevent or mitigate CIPN was also suggested in a secondary analysis of a <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00924651?term=EXCAP&rank=1&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPOG/dXHsio+5HdUbPUeyUTUsHW/EiPppbNzm+ABlV8T+5neDPrY2QUxwNYlVqrOk/w=&amp;TOPIC_ID=94976\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">multicenter phase III trial</a> in which 619 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy were randomly assigned to chemotherapy with or without a standard exercise program (EXCAP; an individualized, moderate-intensity, home-based, six-week progressive walking and resistance exercise program).

However, a subset analysis of 355 patients enrolled in this trial (185 receiving chemotherapy alone and 170 receiving exercise plus chemotherapy) who were receiving a taxane-, platinum-, or vinca alkaloid-containing chemotherapy regimen examined the impact of exercise on CIPN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].

As assessed by these nonstandard neurotoxicity assessment methods, exercise appeared to significantly reduce CIPN for patients receiving vinca alkaloids, platinum, or taxanes; the benefit seemed to be limited to older individuals. The authors postulated that the lack of impact in younger individuals might be attributable to the need for a higher &quot;dose&quot; of exercise needed to prevent CIPN in younger, leaner, and more fit individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report of a subset of 1237 women treated with taxanes who were followed in the Pathways study, a prospective cohort study of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer over a seven-year period at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, also noted that obesity and low physical activity (at the time of chemotherapy initiation) were associated with more severe and sustained CIPN related to taxane treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other published data also provide support for exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/94,98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,98,99</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523404540\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2471856683\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic neurotoxicity</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H682542105\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose reduction, delay, and intermittent treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general,<strong> </strong>patients with mild neuropathy can continue to receive full doses; however, if symptoms increase in severity or the neuropathy interferes with function, the risk of potentially disabling neurotoxicity must be weighed against the benefit of continued treatment.

A device that delivers patient-specific electrocutaneous stimulation to the skin (called &quot;Scrambler therapy&quot;) has shown promise for treatment of neuropathic pain, including that associated with CIPN. Non-randomized pilot trials suggest that Scrambler therapy can reduce chemotherapy-induced neuropathy symptoms, even if symptoms have been present for &gt;1 year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/120-122\" class=\"abstract_t\">120-122</a>]. </p><p>Based upon these trials, two prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials are ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02722434 and NCT02111174) evaluating this approach for patients with established chronic CIPN. These approaches as well as interventional procedures for treatment of painful neuropathies in patients with cancer are discussed in detail elsewhere.

In this randomized controlled trial, 62 cancer survivors with CIPN (mostly females, predominantly treated with taxanes) were randomly assigned to EEG neurofeedback or to waitlist control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. Neurofeedback consisted of 20 sessions in which the participants watched and responded to their own EEGs while playing a game for 45 minutes per session; when they maintained their EEG waveform amplitude over a chosen threshold and inhibited less desirable waveforms, they were given rewarding feedback with a picture and a beep; the game paused when the participant did not match the thresholds preprogrammed into the software, and no auditory or visual feedback was given. Over time, the group completing the neurofeedback experienced significant improvements in pain scores when compared with the waitlist control group. Neurofeedback training also improved patient reports of numbness and tingling. The treatment appeared to be very well tolerated, and there were no reports of adverse events. The generalizability of these results is limited by the small patient sample, the lack of an active or sham control group, and the nonblinded assessment of outcomes. However, additional study of neurofeedback and other approaches to physiologic self-regulation (eg, relaxation training, yoga) are warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2041014810\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute neurotoxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, acute neurotoxicity is predominantly seen in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> and the taxanes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>.
