It is classified as hypokalemic when episodes occur in association with low potassium blood levels or as hyperkalemic when episodes can be induced by elevated potassium. Most cases of periodic paralysis are hereditary, usually with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is a muscle disease that has onset in infancy or early childhood and is manifested by transient episodes of paralysis, usually precipitated by cold exposure, rest after exercise, fasting, or the ingestion of small amounts of potassium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The first description in 1951 was of a family with frequent attacks of paralysis that were of short duration and precipitated by rest after exercise, stress, and certain foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Later, an important observation made was that potassium levels were high in some patients and potassium administration frequently precipitated these attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic discusses hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. Other causes of periodic paralysis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemic periodic paralysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (PP) is a rare disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 1:200,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Women and men appear to be equally affected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperkalemic PP is an autosomal dominant condition with nearly complete penetrance. The cause of hyperkalemic PP is a change in a gene that regulates the production of a protein (SCN4A) in the sodium channel of skeletal muscle. The gene is located in chromosome 17q23, and is known as SCN4A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/1,2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6,7</a>]. At least nine different mutations in this gene have been identified that can cause hyperkalemic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>].</p><p>The sodium channel is a large molecule in the cell membrane of the muscle fiber. It consists of four subunits arranged pairwise around a central opening. When muscle receptors bind transmitters released from a nerve, the sodium channel opens to allow sodium to pass into the muscle cell. This process activates a chain of electrical impulses, triggering muscle contraction. In the resting phase that follows the contraction, the sodium channel is closed.</p><p>In hyperkalemic PP, the sodium channel closes too slowly, and sodium ions continue to leak into the muscle cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/5,6,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,9-11</a>]. This leads to oversensitivity and stiffness in the muscle (myotonia). If the channel remains open the muscle will become desensitized and, as a result, paralyzed. During the episode of muscle weakness or paralysis, potassium ions are released from the muscle and the concentration of potassium in the bloodstream (serum potassium) rises.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms usually begin early in life, usually in the first decade but as early as the first year, with attacks of generalized weakness. The weakness in an attack of hyperkalemic PP can be focal, affecting only one limb, but generalized weakness with hypotonia is more common. Some patients have myalgia with attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Consciousness is preserved and cranial and respiratory muscles are usually spared. Hyperkalemic-induced arrhythmias have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>Reported precipitants of attacks in hyperkalemic PP include anesthesia, cold exposure, rest after exercise, fasting, or the ingestion of small amounts of potassium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/1,2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,16</a>].</p><p>The overlapping range of both the duration and frequency of episodes among patients with hyperkalemic PP and hypokalemic PP make these features unreliable to distinguish them (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65215 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. It is generally reported that episodes in hyperkalemic PP tend to be more frequent (occurring as often as several times in one day), less severe, and shorter in duration (minutes to hours) compared with hypokalemic PP. However, in one case series, the average duration of 24 hours seen in patients with hyperkalemic PP was similar to that in patients with hypokalemic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Episodes lasting for more than one month have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Potassium levels are normal or modestly elevated during attacks; the disorder is so-named because hyperkalemia can precipitate attacks. In one series, the average potassium level recorded during an attack was 5.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Between attacks, myotonia (delayed muscle relaxation after contraction) can be elicited on examination in about 20 to 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>]. This is often subclinical and generally not disabling. In addition to the classic maneuvers to elicit myotonia, having the patient repeatedly open and close his eyes to elicit eyelid myotonia is reported to be a sensitive test for this clinical feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Myotonia'</a>.)</p><p>Attacks are most frequent during adolescence and early adulthood. Later in life, in the fourth to sixth decades, paralytic attacks subside. As these attacks decrease in frequency, most patients develop myopathic weakness, which may be mild or disabling and affects mainly the muscles of the pelvic girdle and lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/5,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,17</a>]. This progressive degenerative myopathy occurs with equal frequency in hyperkalemic PP as in hypokalemic PP, although it is not as widely recognized in the former.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperkalemic PP must be distinguished from other causes of periodic paralysis, which are discussed separately. The periodic paralysis in the Andersen syndrome can be associated with normal or high (as well as low) serum potassium, and should be explicitly excluded because preventive strategies can differ. The distinguishing clinical features of these disorders are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65215 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;(see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemic periodic paralysis&quot;</a>).</p><p>In a first attack of quadriparesis, other diagnoses such as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, acute myelopathy (eg, transverse myelitis), myasthenic crisis, tick paralysis, and botulism may be considered initially. In contrast to hyperkalemic PP, when profound weakness occurs in these disorders, respiratory muscle involvement is common. Also, bulbar and extraocular muscle weakness are common in Guillain Barr&eacute; syndrome, myasthenic crisis, tick paralysis, and botulism, and are rare in hyperkalemic PP. The differential diagnosis of acute quadriparesis is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Other disorders that can cause intermittent muscle weakness include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myasthenia gravis. Weakness in myasthenia gravis typically occurs predictably in the setting of milder degrees of exertion, does not occur in &quot;attacks&quot; as does periodic paralysis, and often involves bulbar and extraocular muscles, which are rarely if ever affected in hyperkalemic PP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic myopathies. Patients with a metabolic myopathy typically complain of exercise intolerance, with myalgias and muscle fatiguability, rather than attacks of weakness. Myoglobinuria may accompany or follow more severe symptoms (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the metabolic myopathies&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When there is an established family history of hyperkalemic PP, further diagnostic evaluation is often not required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">During an acute attack</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elevated serum potassium concentration during an attack may alert the clinician to the diagnosis of hyperkalemic PP. However, the level may be normal or insufficiently abnormal to raise suspicion for this disorder, and other testing for causes of acute muscle weakness may be initiated, such as cervical magnetic resonance imaging, electromyography, and lumbar puncture (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above).</p><p>The presence of peaked T-waves on electrocardiogram (ECG) can be helpful to alert the clinician to the diagnosis of hyperkalemic PP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80441\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80441 \">waveform 1</a>). An ECG should be performed in all patients with periodic paralysis to exclude a long QT or QU interval suggesting Andersen syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77018\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77018 \">waveform 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemic periodic paralysis&quot;, section on 'Andersen syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Between attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperkalemic PP may be difficult to diagnose when patients are evaluated after or between attacks when muscle strength and serum potassium are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Creatine kinase is often elevated between attacks of paralysis, but this is neither sensitive nor specific for hyperkalemic PP.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electromyography (EMG) is probably the most useful test in the interictal evaluation of patients. In the EMG exercise test, compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) following a single supramaximal electrical stimulus are recorded at rest and every one to two minutes following two to five minutes of exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Exercise consists of maximal contraction of a muscle (biceps or anterior tibialis) for two to five minutes with three to four-second rest periods every 15 seconds. A gradual reduction of over 40 percent in the evoked motor amplitude after 30 to 40 minutes is compatible with a diagnosis of PP but is not specific as to type. This test has been reported to have a sensitivity of 71 percent and a specificity of 98 percent for PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].<br/><br/>One report suggests that the EMG exercise test can discriminate between types of periodic paralysis. These investigators found that an initial increase in CMAP followed by a delayed decrease was seen in five of six patients with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis after short-duration exercise (10 to 12 seconds) and only 1 of 13 patients with hypokalemic PP associated with a calcium channel defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Of the two patients with the sodium channel variant of hypokalemic PP, one had this finding.<br/><br/>EMG can also discern subclinical myotonia, seen in 50 to 75 percent of patients with hyperkalemic PP, a finding that distinguishes this disorder from hypokalemic PP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing for the nine most common mutations underlying hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provocative testing can be employed, when genetic testing fails to identify an underlying mutation. Careful monitoring, usually in an inpatient setting, is recommended for all forms of provocative testing:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provocative testing with oral potassium load (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/kg)</span> can also be done, but is dangerous, requiring cardiac monitoring in an inpatient setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exercise, for example, running for 30 minutes on a treadmill, can be a less dangerous alternative or can be used to supplement a potassium load, increasing the sensitivity of the test. Weakness and decreasing amplitude of the CMAP on EMG, usually occurring within one hour, support the diagnosis of hyperkalemic PP, but negative results do not rule out this condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Both hyperkalemic PP and hypokalemic PP can be induced with ACTH. In one study, in three patients with suspected hyperkalemic PP, ACTH (80 to 100 IU IM) was administered in the morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Muscle strength was assessed in the hand with a dynamometer at baseline and every one to two hours, along with measurement of serum potassium. Weakness was observed along with a rise in serum potassium 5 to 6.5 hours later and both recovered within the next hour. Significant side effects did not occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ECG should be performed in all patients with periodic paralysis to exclude a long QT or QU interval suggesting Andersen syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77018\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77018 \">waveform 2</a>).

Some patients can abort attacks with sugar or mild exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/12,18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18,24</a>]. Thiazide diuretics, inhaled beta adrenergic agonists (eg, one to two puffs of 0.1 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>), and intravenous calcium can be used in more severe attacks, especially if accompanied by more severe hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/18,24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24-28</a>]. Beta-adrenergic agents likely work by stimulating the sodium-potassium pump, increasing potassium transport into cells.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of hyperkalemic PP overlap with other periodic paralysis disorders (thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, and the Andersen syndrome) such that they can be difficult to distinguish without additional diagnostic testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65215 \">table 1</a>). <br/><br/>In an acute attack, hyperkalemic PP may be distinguished from other periodic paralyses, as well as other causes of acute quadriparesis, including Guillain Barr&eacute; syndrome, botulism, and cervical myelopathy, by the presence of an elevated potassium concentration, the absence of respiratory and bulbar involvement, and spontaneous recovery within several hours. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)<br/><br/>An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed in all patients with periodic paralysis to exclude a long QT or QU interval suggesting Andersen syndrome (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemic periodic paralysis&quot;, section on 'Andersen syndrome'</a>).<br/><br/>Genetic testing is available for most, but not all of the mutations underlying hyperkalemic PP. Genetic testing may be unnecessary if there is an established family history. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Electromyography (EMG) is useful in the interictal evaluation of patients with periodic paralysis when genetic testing is negative. Electrical myotonia with a history of attacks of weakness strongly suggests the diagnosis of hyperkalemic PP.
