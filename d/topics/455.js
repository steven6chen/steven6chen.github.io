It is caused by a buildup of fluid in the lungs. A buildup of fluid in the lungs can cause problems because it can keep oxygen from getting into the blood. Then the organs in the body do not get as much oxygen as they need.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191178250\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes ARDS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different conditions can cause ARDS, but the most common causes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious infection (sepsis) &ndash; Sepsis is a serious illness that happens when an infection spreads throughout the body.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing vomit into the lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lung infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious accident or injury</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191178257\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ARDS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms of ARDS include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing much faster than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fingertips and lips looking slightly blue</p><p/><p>People can have other symptoms, too. It depends on the cause of their ARDS. For example, a lung infection can cause a fever and cough.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191178264\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, as soon as possible. Many people who get ARDS are already in a hospital. But if you are not in a hospital, you (or the person with you) should call the doctor or nurse if you have any of the symptoms above.</p><p>If your doctor or nurse is not able to see you right away, or you can't reach him or her on the phone, go to the nearest emergency room.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191178271\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for ARDS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor will do an exam and a chest X-ray. He or she might also do a CT scan of your lungs. A CT scan is an imaging test that can create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>The doctor will also do other tests to see what's causing the ARDS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191178278\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ARDS treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ARDS is treated in the hospital, usually in the intensive care unit (called &quot;ICU,&quot; for short).</p><p>People who are having a very hard time breathing usually need a breathing tube. A breathing tube is a tube that goes down the throat and into the lungs. The other end is attached to a machine that helps with breathing (sometimes called a &quot;life support&quot; machine).</p><p>When the tube is in place, people are not able to eat or talk. Plus, they are usually sedated. That means the doctor has given them medicines to make them very sleepy. This helps them not feel pain or anxiety. Once people can breathe on their own again, the doctor can take the tube out.</p><p>If the ARDS is caused by another condition that can be treated, the doctor will treat that condition, too. For example, lung infections are treated with antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191178285\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen in people with ARDS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different problems can happen during treatment. For example, people can get a lung infection from germs in the hospital, or other organs in the body can stop working.</p><p>Although some people with ARDS do not get better, many do get better. But people who get better will often have long-term lung problems caused by their ARDS. They might also be physically weak and have thinking problems, which can happen if the brain doesn't get enough oxygen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191178341\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sepsis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=going-home-from-the-hospital-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Going home from the hospital (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-directives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Advance directives (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-prevention-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia prevention in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
