This disorder can occur sporadically, or as a manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). Medical therapy is the current standard of care for most patients with ZES as part of the MEN 1 syndrome. By contrast, many patients with sporadic ZES are candidates for surgical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Prior to the development of effective acid suppression therapy, the major morbidity and mortality of ZES were related to complications of fulminant peptic ulcer disease; total gastrectomy was the only effective measure to protect patients from these problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The development of H2 antagonists and the more powerful proton pump inhibitors has resulted in a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality from ulcer disease and has obviated the need for gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of 212 patients with ZES studied prospectively for a mean of 13.8 years, a ZES-related cause of death could be identified in only half of the 31 percent who died. All of the ZES-related deaths were due to tumor spread; none were due to hypersecretory complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the two current goals of therapy in ZES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of the complications resulting from autonomous release of gastrin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of the tumor itself</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of medical management in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is to limit the clinical manifestations and complications of peptic ulcer disease. Because peptic symptoms in patients with ZES are often a poor marker of acid secretion, formal acid secretory studies have been advocated to guide the dosage of acid suppressants, with the goal of reducing gastric acid secretion to below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/h</span> prior to the next dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, such studies are often not available even in major medical centers, and it has become customary among many gastroenterologists to initiate and maintain proton pump inhibitors at high dosage (eg, 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>), using symptoms alone as a signal to increase the dose. To the author's knowledge, there have been few if any episodes of major peptic diathesis associated with this approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Proton pump inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proton pump inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexlansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexlansoprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pantoprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabeprazole</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a>) effectively block acid secretion by irreversibly binding to and inhibiting the <span class=\"nowrap\">hydrogen/potassium</span> ATPase that resides on the luminal surface of the parietal cell.

Their effects last for more than 24 hours; as a result, many patients can be treated with a once a day regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A four-year prospective study of 40 patients with ZES who were treated with omeprazole found the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Omeprazole</a> effectively controlled acid output in all patients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirty-one patients could be managed by administration of the drug once a day, while nine patients required a 60 mg twice a day regimen</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Omeprazole</a> was able to completely resolve peptic symptoms in 23 of 29 patients who described symptoms while on H2 blocker therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No patients experienced tachyphylaxis, and no hematologic, metabolic, or gastric toxicity was noted</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopy with gastric biopsy revealed no evidence of gastric carcinoid tumors as a complication of long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> therapy</p><p/><p>Patients with ZES should be started on a high dose of a PPI (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 60 mg daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> 120 mg daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a> 45 mg daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabeprazole</a> 60 mg daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pantoprazole</a> 120 mg daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8</a>]. Some patients require an early upward titration of these doses; however, once control of acid output has been achieved, a gradual dose reduction is usually possible. In a study of 37 patients who had received high dose omeprazole for almost two years, nearly 50 percent were able to titrate the maintenance dose down to 20 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Overall, 95 percent of patients without MEN 1, severe gastroesophageal reflux, or previous partial gastrectomy had safe reductions in their medication dose.</p><p>PPIs have been generally safe, even when used in high doses.

This recommendation is derived from the observation that in addition to eliminating or at least decreasing the need for antisecretory medical therapy, successful resection of sporadic gastrinomas protects against the possibility of eventual morbidity and death from metastatic spread of the tumor (see below). In the hands of an experienced surgeon, up to 50 percent of these patients will be cured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. Lymphadenectomy exceeding more than 10 lymph nodes at the time of surgery has been shown to achieve a higher biochemical cure as compared with selective or no lymphadenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The likelihood for surgical cure is especially high for extrapancreatic gastrinomas (eg, those in the duodenum or peripancreatic lymph nodes). In contrast, laparotomy is not routinely recommended for patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) as part of MEN 1 since the multifocal nature of the tumors in this disorder almost uniformly precludes cure of gastrin hypersecretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Treatment&quot;</a>.) However, because a minority of MEN-1 tumors can have aggressive growth patterns, some recommend imaging techniques or even surgical exploration to identify those exceeding 2 cm with the intent of resecting them.</p><p>Eighty percent of curable gastrinomas lie within the gastrinoma triangle comprised of the head of the pancreas and the duodenal sweep. The combination of preoperative localization techniques makes it possible for the experienced surgeon to identify over 90 percent of sporadic gastrinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>]. Intraoperative transduodenal illumination and duodenotomy are of particular value in detecting very small gastrinomas arising in the wall of the duodenum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>].

In the unlikely event that a sporadic gastrinoma cannot be identified at surgery, we suggest deferring a Whipple's procedure in favor of closure, with the intent of serial imaging every six months to try to localize the neoplasm.</p><p>Gastric secretion may not return to the normal range following gastrinoma resection because of a residual excess of gastric parietal cells, a consequence of the trophic effect of chronically elevated gastrin levels. Up to 40 percent of patients will require prolonged antisecretory therapy to control hyperacidity following curative resection, and such patients need continued monitoring for acid hypersecretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Of 50 patients who underwent curative resection for ZES, gastric hypersecretion was observed for a mean of eight years in 62 percent of patients and was judged to be extreme in 28 percent despite normal blood gastrin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A parietal cell (proximal gastric) vagotomy performed at the time of tumor resection has been advocated to reduce (and in some cases obviate) the need for postoperative medical therapy, particularly when complete resection of the gastrinoma tissue cannot be accomplished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>]. However, it is currently uncommonly performed because of the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors. Furthermore, relatively few surgeons currently perform this procedure.</p><p>The reduction in mortality associated with surgical therapy for patients without metastatic disease was illustrated in a prospective study of 124 patients with gastrinoma presumed to be free of metastasis by imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Only 3 percent of the 98 patients who underwent resection developed liver metastases during a mean follow-up period of 6.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. By contrast, 23 percent of 26 patients treated medically developed metastatic disease over a slightly longer follow-up period (8.7 years). Two deaths due to metastatic gastrinoma occurred in the medically treated group compared with no disease-specific deaths in the operative group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Reoperation for recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although surgery decreases the incidence of hepatic metastases and improves survival, long-term biochemical cure is achieved in less than 30 percent. Reoperation may be of benefit in those with recurrent ZES in whom the tumor can be identified and localized. In one study, for example, 17 patients with recurrent disease that was unequivocally imaged underwent 18 reoperations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Five patients were disease free after operation, with a median follow-up of 28 months. There were no deaths in the cured group; two patients in the group with persistent disease died during a median follow-up of 34 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIATION THERAPY FOR NONSURGICAL CANDIDATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experience with external beam radiotherapy (RT) in the management of islet cell tumors is limited. Although pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas were previously considered to represent a radioresistant tumor, data from published case reports and small case series suggest that RT can produce high rates of symptomatic palliation and freedom from local progression in patients who are not candidates for surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPY OF METASTATIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver is the major metastatic site for gastrinomas, as it is with other islet cell tumors. The second most common site is bone (7 percent of patients in one series), almost all of which occur in patients who also have liver metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The axial skeleton (spine or sacrum) is the primary site of bone metastasis, but other sites can be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and MRI are the best tests to detect these lesions; the former is preferred because extra-axial lesions can occur.</p><p>Metastatic gastrinoma is now the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES). Unfortunately, current treatment modalities are of limited benefit.

In an illustrative series, 185 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) were followed prospectively for a mean of 12.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver metastases were found in 24 percent of patients at the time of diagnosis; the majority of these patients had a primary pancreatic neoplasm, and 67 percent had primary tumors that were greater than 3 cm in size.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with liver metastases had a 10-year survival of only 30 percent compared with a 15-year survival of 83 percent in those without liver metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lymph node metastases had the same mortality as those who were free of visceral metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with MEN 1 had a significantly lower rate of metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis (6 percent); their high overall survival rate (100 percent at 20 years) reflected this fact.</p><p/><p>The level of fasting serum gastrin (FSG) at the time of initial diagnosis may provide an indication of disease extent and estimated prognosis in patients with sporadic ZES. In a follow-up report of 239 patients with ZES, the level of preoperative FSG correlated with tumor size and presence of lymph nodes and liver metastases (as found at exploration), as well as primary site (pancreas tumors associated with highest levels of FSG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The five-year survival rates for patients with mild (0 to 499 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> moderate (500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> or severe elevations (&gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> of FSG were 94, 92, and 86 percent, respectively. The corresponding 10-year survival rates were 86, 87, and 73 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTTREATMENT SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited evidence from which to make recommendations for follow-up after resection of a gastrinoma. Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network based upon expert consensus include the following recommendations for follow-up after treatment of an islet cell tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three and six months postresection &mdash; History and physical examination, serum gastrin, and computed <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/magnetic</span> resonance imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term &ndash; History and physical examination with tumor markers every six to 12 months for years 1 to 3, and as clinically indicated thereafter. Imaging studies are recommended only as clinically indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical therapy is the current standard of care for most patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) as part of the MEN 1 syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Treatment&quot;</a>.) By contrast, we recommend that (in addition to medical therapy) patients with a sporadic gastrinoma and without evidence of metastatic spread of disease be treated with exploratory laparotomy with curative intent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In addition to eliminating or at least decreasing the need for antisecretory medical therapy, successful resection of sporadic gastrinomas protects against the possibility of eventual morbidity and death from metastatic spread of the tumor. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Medical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of medical management in ZES is to limit the clinical manifestations and complications of peptic ulcer disease. We recommend that patients with ZES should be started on a high dose proton pump inhibitor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 60 mg daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> 120 mg daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a> 45 mg daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabeprazole</a> 60 mg daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pantoprazole</a> 120 mg daily (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Subsequent lowering of dosage without recurrence of symptoms is usually achievable. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Medical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality from gastrinomas depends largely upon whether the tumor is benign or malignant, and the extent of disease involvement. Metastatic gastrinoma is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with ZES. Unfortunately, the current modalities for treatment of metastatic disease have been of limited benefit. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with limited, resectable liver-isolated metastatic gastrinoma, we recommend surgical resection of the hepatic metastases along with the primary tumor (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Although the majority of cases will not be cured by surgery, given the slow-growing nature of the tumor, extended survival is sometimes possible. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other treatment options for patients with unresectable hepatic-predominant metastatic disease include embolization, chemoembolization, RFA, and cryoablation. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Liver-directed therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of somatostatin analogs for patients with symptomatic metastatic gastrinoma is unpredictable, but some patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumors may benefit. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Somatostatin analogs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other systemic therapy approaches (chemotherapy, molecularly targeted agents, and peptide receptor radioligand therapy) to control symptoms and tumor growth are discussed in detail elsewhere.
