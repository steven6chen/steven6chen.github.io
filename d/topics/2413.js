ASCVD can be subdivided into four major areas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary heart disease manifesting as myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrovascular disease manifesting as stroke and transient ischemic attack</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral artery disease manifesting as intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic atherosclerosis and thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysm</p><p/><p>Inflammation is a known factor in the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent ASCVD events. Ongoing inflammation increases the vulnerability of an atherosclerotic lesion to erosion or rupture. The most extensively studied biomarker of inflammation in ASCVD is C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein that is produced predominantly by hepatocytes under the influence of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c-reactive-protein-in-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

These issues as well as the mechanisms of association with cardiovascular risk will be reviewed here, along with the role of serum CRP in screening for ASCVD risk. The incremental value of CRP beyond traditional risk factors for estimating ASCVD risk in an individual patient continues to be debated and is discussed separately.

Early observations suggested that there may be a direct effect of CRP on the development of atherosclerosis, based on the finding of CRP in atherosclerotic lesions; CRP&rsquo;s binding to low density lipoprotein (LDL), allowing LDL to be taken up by macrophages without the need for modification; and pro-inflammatory effects following CRP infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c-reactive-protein-in-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].</p><p>In contrast to these experimental and clinical observations, other reports have not supported a direct role of CRP in atherogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c-reactive-protein-in-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/3,10,13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,13-19</a>]. Observations from two large (Mendelian randomization) studies suggest that there is not a direct pathogenic role of CRP:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of over 50,000 individuals with and without ischemic ASCVD in whom the levels of high-sensitivity CRP and genotype for four CRP polymorphisms were known, the following findings were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c-reactive-protein-in-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The risk of ischemic heart disease was increased significantly in persons who had serum CRP levels above 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> as compared with persons with CRP levels below 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (adjusted hazard ratio 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1).

It is the hs-CRP assays that are used to determine cardiovascular risk.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditional assays, developed to aid in the diagnosis of infectious or inflammatory illnesses, have a limit of detection in the range of 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span>.

These fluctuations are thought to reflect changes in an individual&rsquo;s systemic inflammatory status. As such, the <span class=\"nowrap\">CDC/AHA</span> recommends that the hs-CRP be checked twice to confirm a stable value prior to taking any therapeutic actions. The following observations illustrate the magnitude of variability of CRP in adults:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 113 healthy adults, the variability in quarterly serum CRP measurements over one year was similar to that for serum total cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c-reactive-protein-in-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

When patients were stratified into three risk categories (CRP &lt;1, 1 to 3, and &gt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L),</span> 40 percent of patients changed risk category between the first and second measurements. Similar fluctuations were noted in interleukin (IL)-6, another inflammatory marker.

The most extensively studied biomarker of inflammation in ASCVD is C-reactive protein (CRP). Despite a lack of specificity for the cause of inflammation, data from numerous epidemiologic studies have shown a significant association between elevated serum or plasma concentrations of CRP and the prevalence of underlying atherosclerosis, the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events among patients with established disease, and the incidence of first cardiovascular events among individuals at risk for atherosclerosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Possible pathogenic role of CRP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the ideal value that constitutes a high serum high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP; and increased cardiovascular risk) is not clearly defined, ranges articulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) for the use of serum hs-CRP to estimate cardiovascular risk are routinely employed when hs-CRP is measured for this purpose. There is no standardized CRP value that can be considered normal. However, individuals with values &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> have been considered to be at lowest risk, with low-, average-, and high-risk values defined as &lt;1, 1 to 3, and &gt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1311435769\" class=\"local\">'Clinical context'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several large population-based studies evaluating CRP in unselected asymptomatic populations have shown that, among apparently healthy individuals, the baseline level of CRP predicts the long-term risk of a first myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, sudden cardiac death, and all-cause mortality. While serum CRP does appear to act as an independent predictor of ASCVD in the general population, the predictive value added to that determined by screening for other coronary risk factors is small. (See <a href=\"#H700526850\" class=\"local\">'Association of CRP with cardiovascular risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of hs-CRP to screen the general population for cardiovascular risk is controversial. While some experts recommend the routine measurement of hs-CRP at the time of cholesterol screening to be used as adjunctive data in the overall assessment of cardiovascular risk, we continue to prioritize the assessment of traditional risk factors and consider hs-CRP primarily for those with intermediate cardiovascular risk as determined using traditional risk factors and one or more of the available risk calculators. (See <a href=\"#H1723784404\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-risk-calculators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Screening patients at low risk for ASCVD using hs-CRP has <strong>not</strong> been shown to change the current recommendations of lifestyle modifications in such individuals. Similarly, screening individuals at high risk for ASCVD with hs-CRP would <strong>not</strong> change current guideline-based management of established risk factors. Therefore, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend a strategy of routinely measuring hs-CRP in unselected populations to screen for ASCVD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients at intermediate risk for CVD using traditional risk factors and contemporary risk calculators (ie, 10 to 20 percent risk at 10 years) for whom a more definite estimate of cardiovascular risk might change their individual decision about whether or not to initiate statin therapy, we suggest a screening measurement of hs-CRP (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The JUPITER trial suggests that the measurement of hs-CRP might help in the identification of asymptomatic patients at intermediate risk of cardiovascular events who may benefit from lipid-lowering treatment if CRP is &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span>.
