Hypocomplementemia, when present, may be associated with extensive vasculitis and systemic features that most commonly involve the musculoskeletal, pulmonary, renal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal systems. Although UV is most commonly idiopathic, it can occur in association with autoimmune diseases, drug reactions, infections, or malignancy.

Some patients have low complement levels, a feature that is associated with more severe disease and with systemic involvement. By comparison, patients with normal complement levels are more likely to have mild disease (sometimes referred to as normocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis [NUV]).</p><p>Urticarial vasculitis is sometimes discussed as a clinical feature that is part of another diagnosis, and sometimes as a primary diagnosis or syndrome. Based upon complement levels and presence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> absence of specific systemic findings the terms that appear with UV as a distinct diagnostic entity are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome (HUVS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p>The distinctions between these two syndromes are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HUVS has been recognized as a specific autoimmune disorder involving six or more months of urticaria with hypocomplementemia, in the presence of various systemic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/1,7,9-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,9-15</a>]. </p><p>These systemic findings typically include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis or arthralgias</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild glomerulonephritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uveitis or episcleritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent abdominal pain</p><p/><p>HUVS can occur independently or can be associated with other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> below.) </p><p>Diagnostic criteria for HUVS have been proposed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82138\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82138 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, these criteria lack specificity, and a diagnosis of HUVS should <strong>not</strong> be made without a skin biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H41\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A biopsy showing cutaneous small vessel vasculitis with a characteristic immunofluorescence staining is essential to the diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Immunofluorescence'</a> below). When measured, C1q levels are frequently found to be low, although the specificity and positive predictive value of this finding are not clear and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus may also have decreased C1q levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, whether a depressed C1q level is necessary to diagnose HUVS is unresolved. Antibodies to the collagen-like region of C1q (C1q precipitins) are present in most patients with HUVS. Although this test is not clinically available , the C1q solid-phase test for immune complexes and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-C1q autoantibodies give nearly equivalent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HUV is the term used to describe patients with UV and hypocomplementemia who do not meet diagnostic criteria for HUVS. In general, patients with HUV have cutaneous disease and few or no systemic manifestations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is believed to result from the formation of immune complexes in the blood that then deposit in vessel walls. In support of this hypothesis are the findings on skin biopsy (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Histology'</a> below), the association of UV with some disorders in which the antigen-antibody complexes are well defined (eg, hepatitis B, hepatitis C), and the observation that removal of immune complexes by plasmapheresis is temporally associated with the resolution of the urticarial lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>The antigens eliciting the formation of antibodies are not known in many cases of UV. Medications and viruses (particularly hepatitis B and C) have been implicated as the target antigen in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. There have also been reports demonstrating the development of UV in association with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a>, and the injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> dermal filler agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p>In some patients with UV (particularly those with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome [HUVS]), a collagen-like region on C1q has been implicated as the antigenic target [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18</a>]. The autoantibody is referred to as a C1q precipitin. A causative role of these specific autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of UV has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/7,16,20,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16,20,26-28</a>].</p><p>Once antigen-antibody complexes have formed, they can activate the classical complement pathway. This generates C3a and C5a, which cause mast cell degranulation resulting in urticarial eruptions. C3a and C5a also cause increased vessel permeability and chemotaxis of neutrophils. Infiltrating neutrophils release proteolytic enzymes, causing further tissue destruction and edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>It has been hypothesized that IL-1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of UV. This is based on both the theoretical observation that features of UV have been noted in autoinflammatory disorders in which IL-1 is thought to play a role, as well as and practical observations in which anakinra (an IL-1 antagonist) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a> (a long-acting fully humanized monoclonal anti-IL-1-beta antibody) have been reported to successfully treat UV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4323686\" class=\"local\">'Severe systemic disease'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to environmental factors, genetic factors are thought to play a role in the development of HUVS. A study including two families with autosomal-recessive HUVS found that mutations in DNASE1L3 were associated with a familial form of HUVS and HUVS associated with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

These more severe findings, typically with a neutrophilic infiltrate, are seen in patients with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome (HUVS). Rarely, lymphocytic, as opposed to leukocytoclastic, vasculitis may be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunofluorescence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct immunofluorescence reveals deposits of immunoglobulins, complement, or fibrin around blood vessels in most patients with UV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/18,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,37</a>].

This is partly due to a lack of clarity in the medical literature resulting from the variety of cutaneous, systemic, and serologic features associated with the disease. As an example, the prevalence of UV in patients with chronic urticaria varies from 5 to 20 percent, depending on the definition of vasculitis used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/3,18,32,39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18,32,39-43</a>].</p><p>Women comprise 60 to 80 percent of reported patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/18,38,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,38,44</a>]. The peak reported incidence is in the fourth decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/35,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38</a>]. UV has also been described in children; the youngest reported case occurred in a patient one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermatologic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urticarial plaques (or wheals) of urticarial vasculitis (UV) can be found anywhere on the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66203%7EALLRG%2F54877%7EALLRG%2F77924%7EALLRG%2F66672%7EALLRG%2F81159\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66203 graphicRef54877 graphicRef77924 graphicRef66672 graphicRef81159 \">picture 2A-E</a>).

Several of the following features can help distinguish UV wheals from those in common urticaria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77125\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77125 \">table 2</a>), although none is diagnostic:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common urticaria is pruritic and not painful.

By definition, the diagnosis of UV requires the presence of both characteristic clinical manifestations and pathologic evidence of LCV; thus, a biopsy should always be performed to establish the diagnosis of UV, even if the clinical presentation appears typical of UV or hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome (HUVS).</p><p>In addition to routine histologic evaluation for LCV, direct immunofluorescence should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-vasculitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Perivascular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> basement membrane zone deposits of immunoglobulin or complement frequently are present in UV.

We typically obtain two 4 mm punch biopsies from lesional skin. Our tissue sample for direct immunofluorescence is usually one-half of one of the punch biopsy specimens (split vertically with a scalpel) as this procedure allows for an additional tissue sample for routine histologic evaluation. Alternatively, the entire specimen from the second punch biopsy can be sent for direct immunofluorescence.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathophysiology of UV is believed to involve the deposition of immune complexes in vessel walls, complement activation, and mast cell degranulation due to C3a and C5a with resultant urticaria. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocytoclasis, or fragmentation of leukocytes with nuclear debris, and fibrinoid deposits are important histopathologic findings that represent direct signs of vessel damage. Immunofluorescence reveals deposits of immunoglobulins, complement, or fibrin around blood vessels in most patients. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Histology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The urticarial lesions of UV can be found anywhere on the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66203%7EALLRG%2F54877\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66203 graphicRef54877 \">picture 2A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77924 \">picture 2C</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66672\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66672 \">picture 2D</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F81159\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81159 \">picture 2E</a>). Certain features can help distinguish UV wheals from those in common urticaria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77125\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77125 \">table 2</a>), although none is diagnostic. Systemic findings most often involve the musculoskeletal, renal, and pulmonary systems. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>UV is most commonly idiopathic, although it can occur in association with autoimmune diseases, drug reactions, infections, or malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of UV requires the presence of urticaria with leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) on skin biopsy. If LCV is present, then further testing is indicated to define the presence and extent of systemic disease and evaluate for associated conditions. (See <a href=\"#H41\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Skin biopsy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H42\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>UV is a benign and self-limited disease for the majority of patients, although symptoms can last for decades in some individuals. (See <a href=\"#H48\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UV is often difficult to treat, and therapy is based upon case reports and small series. Management is guided by the clinical presentation, and agents are chosen based upon the severity of the disease and presence of systemic involvement. Systemic glucocorticoids are considered the mainstay of therapy for UV, and additional agents are typically added.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89734329\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic therapy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antihistamines are used to manage pruritus if urticaria is a prominent features of the disease. These drugs do not impact the course of the disease, and one preparation has not been shown to be superior to another for this condition. We start with a non-sedating agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a> (10 mg once daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a> (60 mg once or twice daily), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a> (10 mg once daily). (See <a href=\"#H4324596\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used to treat the arthralgias and arthritis associated with UV. (See <a href=\"#H4324596\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89734336\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild to moderate disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids in combination with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> are typically used as initial therapy for patients with mild to moderate disease, although there is more experience with glucocorticoids and dapsone. This approach is typically reserved for patients who do NOT have organ- or life-threatening manifestations of the disease (eg, renal failure) and who have not responded to antihistamines and NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"#H4323109\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate disease'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89734342\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe systemic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with refractory symptoms or those with organ- or life-threatening disease manifestations, we use other agents in combination with glucocorticoids. The assistance of a rheumatologist with experience in the management of vasculitides is suggested for patients with evidence of significant systemic disease. (See <a href=\"#H4323686\" class=\"local\">'Severe systemic disease'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based on limited data from case reports and small case series, along with our own experience, we generally use the following agents listed in order of preference: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. We rarely use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, given the potential toxicity and limited benefit. (See <a href=\"#H4323686\" class=\"local\">'Severe systemic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As more evidence becomes available for the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, anakinra, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>, these agents may become preferred.
