Catecholamine-secreting sympathetic paragangliomas often present clinically like pheochromocytomas with hypertension, episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia. However, the distinction between pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma is an important one because of implications for associated neoplasms, risk for malignancy, and genetic testing.

Approximately 75 percent of sympathetic paragangliomas arise in the abdomen, most often at the junction of the vena cava and the renal veins, or at the organ of Zuckerkandl, which resides just above the aortic bifurcation near the take-off of the inferior mesenteric artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86631\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86631 \">image 2</a>).

The definition of malignancy is not always straightforward. Although preoperative imaging may infrequently reveal evidence for tumor invasion of adjacent organs, neither this finding nor any histologic feature reliably predicts malignant behavior. According to the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, the only true indicator of malignant behavior is metastatic spread to the regional nodes or distant sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The majority of patients with malignant skull base and neck paragangliomas experience regional spread (69 percent in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]) rather than distant metastases. The difficulty of reoperating in the neck for recurrent metastatic paraganglioma has led some to suggest selective ipsilateral node dissection to identify occult metastatic disease for patients with skull base and neck paragangliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

As an example, in a series of 59 cases of malignant skull base and neck paraganglioma extracted from the National Cancer Database, metastases were restricted to the regional nodes in 69 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These data have led many to recommend selective lymph node dissection at the time of primary resection of malignant skull base and neck paragangliomas. (See <a href=\"#H25255740\" class=\"local\">'Resection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H25256129\" class=\"local\">'Resection'</a> below.)</p><p>Although outcomes of patients with regional nodal disease are better than they are with distant metastases (five-year survival 77 versus 12 percent in the above noted series from the National Cancer Database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]), adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is frequently recommended. (See <a href=\"#H932245029\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast to skull base and neck paragangliomas, patients with malignant paragangliomas below the skull base and neck have a higher likelihood of developing distant metastases, most commonly to the bone, liver, and lung. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology#H15698737\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paragangliomas: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;, section on 'Overview'</a>.)</p><p>While the presence of distant metastatic disease has an adverse effect on prognosis, metastases do not necessarily represent a contraindication to resection, particularly for paragangliomas below the skull base and neck. Palliative surgery may be performed primarily to reduce or ameliorate a hypersecretory state, but can also release tumor pressure on surrounding tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A lower tumor burden can result in a significant decrease in catecholamine secretion (for functioning tumors) as well as lowered dosage of agents used for alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade. It can also improve the response to other therapeutic approaches. A survival advantage for surgical debulking has not been shown. (See <a href=\"#H520462180\" class=\"local\">'General principles of locoregional management'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7781944\" class=\"local\">'Medical preparation for surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520462180\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LOCOREGIONAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for locoregional management can include surgical resection or radiation therapy (RT). In general, resection is preferred for localized paragangliomas arising below the neck and for all catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas or paragangliomas that are symptomatic from tumor bulk arising at any site. Less invasive approaches, such as conventionally-fractionated external beam RT or stereotactic body RT (SBRT), may provide high rates of long-term disease control for skull base and neck paragangliomas or for non-skull base and neck paragangliomas that are unresectable, but they do not offer the same degree of symptom relief that is accomplished with resection. (See <a href=\"#H25255879\" class=\"local\">'Primary radiation therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H25256349\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>An algorithmic approach to locoregional management of paragangliomas is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F102355\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102355 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177281754\"><span class=\"h2\">General surgical principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with an inherited syndrome predisposing to paraganglioma may have concurrent multiple tumors (eg, von Hippel Lindau disease with cerebellar hemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, and pancreatic islet cell tumors). In general, treatment of the catecholamine-secreting tumor typically takes clinical priority and is resected first. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2759155\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A presumptive preoperative diagnosis of a paraganglioma can usually be made using biochemical and radiographic testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81154\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81154 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Prior to resection, catecholamine secretion should be assessed biochemically in all patients with suspected paraganglioma, even if they do not present with a clinical picture of catecholamine hypersecretion. Undiagnosed catecholamine hypersecretion in patients without symptoms of catecholamine excess is not uncommon and can cause major morbidity and mortality during resection. In fact, if severe labile hypertension occurs during anesthetic induction or early in the resection of a cervical, perinephric, lower abdominal, or pelvic mass that is not yet known to be catecholamine-secreting paraganglioma, the presumptive diagnosis of a catecholamine-secreting tumor should be made and the case aborted, with return for definitive resection only after evaluation and adrenergic blockade is performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology#H60675447\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paragangliomas: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with a catecholamine-secreting tumor, radiologic imaging can provide information about tumor localization. For nonsecretory tumors, imaging characteristics are frequently sufficiently distinctive (by location and a high degree of vascularity) to permit a presumptive preoperative diagnosis of paraganglioma. The most commonly used tests are ultrasound, cross sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and radioisotope imaging using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (indium-111-pentreotide scintigraphy, Octreoscan). Radiographic screening for metastatic disease (typically using FDG-PET) is indicated for patients with germline succinate dehydrogenase (<em>SDHB</em>) mutations, given the high rate of malignant paraganglioma in this subset, but is usually not warranted for other groups unless there are symptoms or signs that raise suspicion for the presence of metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology#H15699100\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paragangliomas: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology#H2263352\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paragangliomas: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;, section on 'Screening for synchronous and metastatic disease'</a>.)</p><p>Many patients proceed directly to surgery without benefit of a preoperative biopsy. Preoperative biopsy (incisional or by fine needle aspiration [FNA]) is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in a patient suspected of having any type of catecholamine-secreting tumor. The findings on FNA are of little value, particularly for skull base and neck paragangliomas. In addition to the challenge of establishing the correct diagnosis, biopsy may result in severe hemorrhage or subsequent fibrosis, with subsequent difficulty with definitive surgery. FNA or a core needle biopsy may be indicated in a patient who has suspected distant metastatic disease to establish the diagnosis and permit optimal treatment planning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology#H9831867\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paragangliomas: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;, section on 'Tissue diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2759162\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of arteriography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although tumor extent is often well demonstrated by CT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI, vascularity is best studied with digital subtraction angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition to demonstrating displacement of blood vessels, potential vessel compromise by tumor invasion, and the adequacy of the intracranial circulation if internal carotid artery sacrifice is necessary, arteriography can also reveal previously unsuspected synchronous paragangliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. However, selective arteriography is not essential in the evaluation of skull base and neck paragangliomas unless preoperative embolization is being considered prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"#H520462646\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative arterial embolization of skull base and neck paragangliomas'</a> below.)</p><p>To avoid precipitating a catecholamine crisis, all patients suspected of having a paraganglioma should have negative biochemical results for catecholamine hypersecretion before interventional imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tumor manipulation, or should undergo alpha-adrenergic blockade prior to arteriography or embolization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7781944\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical preparation for surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with undiagnosed catecholamine-secreting tumors who undergo surgery for other reasons (and who therefore have not undergone preoperative adrenergic blockade) have high rates of perioperative mortality due to lethal hypertensive crisis, malignant arrhythmias, and multi-organ failure. For this reason, some form of preoperative pharmacologic preparation is indicated for all patients with catecholamine-secreting neoplasms. If tumors are nonfunctional by biochemical testing, they do not require blockade.</p><p>Preoperative medical therapy is aimed at controlling hypertension, preventing a hypertensive crisis during surgery, and providing volume expansion to reverse catecholamine-induced blood volume contraction preoperatively in order to prevent severe hypotension after tumor removal. There are several approaches to medical therapy in preparation for surgery in patients with catecholamine-secreting tumors. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, calcium channel blockers, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrosine</a> have all been used successfully. No randomized controlled trials have compared the different approaches, and there is no universally accepted method. Our approach parallels that used prior to resection of a pheochromocytoma; this subject is discussed elsewhere.

Prior to surgery, it is appropriate and important for the surgeon to assess the adequacy of adrenergic blockade that has been administered by themselves or other caregivers, so that <span class=\"nowrap\">she/he</span> can optimize the degree of blockade before proceeding on to a safe operation. The goal of preoperative adrenergic blockade and volume expansion is to achieve a normal heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output throughout the surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86832\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86832 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>During the procedure, the surgeon should communicate frequently with the anesthesiologist especially upon incision, at the time of division of the venous supply, and during tumor manipulation. The anesthesiologist must employ appropriate vascular access and monitoring devices including a bladder catheter. The anesthesiologist must be prepared to counteract alpha- and beta-adrenergic catecholamine-induced cardiovascular effects with short-acting medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentolamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>), and should communicate with the surgeon if such methods require use and when such methods are discontinued. Intraoperatively, cardiovascular and hemodynamic variables must be monitored closely, with continuous measurement of intra-arterial pressure and heart rhythm. For patients with heart failure or decreased cardiac reserve, monitoring of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is indicated. Fluid administration and output should be carefully monitored.</p><p>In the immediate postoperative period, continued monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose levels is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The planning target volume (PTV) is the GTV with a uniform expansion for setup uncertainty that is 1 to 5 mm depending on the system of immobilization and image-guidance.

Local control rates are higher, 86 to 100 percent, for benign tumors in which gross total resection can be achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/16,24,40,64,78,80,81,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24,40,64,78,80,81,99</a>].</p><p>For patients with symptomatic tympanic paragangliomas (Fisch class A and B, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86566 \">table 1</a>)), surgical resection (tympanoplastic surgery) represents the treatment of choice if there are no contraindications to general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/16,38,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,38,100</a>]. These tumors become symptomatic (pulsatile tinnitus, conductive hearing loss) at an early stage in the majority of cases, and complete resection can be accomplished in most with a low risk of damage to the lower cranial nerves. Initial observation may be considered in the rare patient with an asymptomatic tumor &lt;2-3 cm. (See <a href=\"#H761997\" class=\"local\">'Initial observation'</a> above.) </p><p>Optimal treatment for jugular paragangliomas is more controversial, particularly for advanced tumors. While resection is possible for Fisch class C and D tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86566 \">table 1</a>) using an infratemporal or juxtacondylar approach, there is a high risk of postoperative cranial nerve dysfunction because of the intimate association of these tumors with the lower cranial nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/16,24,39,40,78,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24,39,40,78,81</a>]. The results of surgery can best be illustrated by a systematic review of retrospective published series that included 1084 patients with jugular paragangliomas who were treated with a variety of surgical approaches; surgical control (defined as alive without evidence of disease during the entire follow-up period) was achieved in 85 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. There were 1183 preoperative cranial neuropathies, which increased to 2148 postoperatively; thus, surgery resulted in 965 new cranial nerve deficits. Importantly, hearing loss was not included in this analysis because of lack of reporting in most series. The incidence of &quot;dead ears&quot; after surgery in four series totaling 266 cases of jugular paraganglioma was 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/81,101-103\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,101-103</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25256349\"><span class=\"h4\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major advantage of primary RT for jugulotympanic paragangliomas is avoidance of the morbidity of resection while offering a high probability of tumor control. However, as noted above, while less invasive approaches such as RT may provide high rates of long-term disease control for asymptomatic head and neck paragangliomas, they do not offer the same degree of symptom relief that is accomplished with resection. (See <a href=\"#H520462180\" class=\"local\">'General principles of locoregional management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1548031\" class=\"local\">'General radiation therapy principles'</a> above.)</p><p>Durable local control is reported in 89 to 98 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/39-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-46</a>].

As an example, in a systematic review that included 461 patients with a jugular paraganglioma who were treated with conventional fractionation RT, there were 242 cranial neuropathies prior to treatment, and with a mean duration of follow-up of 113 months, this decreased to 232 after RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>However, a number of serious complications are reported after RT for a jugular paraganglioma, including temporal bone osteomyelitis, temporal bone necrosis, pituitary insufficiency, brain necrosis, and sensorineural hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41</a>].

Because of the risk of tumor spillage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>], it is essential to employ circumferential en bloc oncologic technique with no entry of the tumor capsule. To this end, it is taught that the patient should be gently mobilized away from the tumor and not vice versa. Paragangliomas are notably hypervascular; thus, although early division of the outflow vein(s) is optimal for maintaining hemodynamic stability, oncologic mobilization and resection is frequently assisted by early division of the multiple inflow vessels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20515835\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approaches to resection of abdominal paragangliomas may be either open or endoscopic (which may be laparoscopic or posterior retroperitoneal). As with pheochromocytomas (intra-adrenal paragangliomas), endoscopic removal of extra-adrenal paragangliomas is the preferred surgical approach in experienced hands, and when it is anatomically feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/13,47-50,107-111\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,47-50,107-111</a>]. Although there are less published data than for laparoscopic adrenalectomy in the case of a pheochromocytoma, laparoscopic procedures reduce postoperative morbidity, hospital stay, and expense compared with conventional laparotomy. A retroperitoneal endoscopic approach is appropriate for some suprarenal paragangliomas, while a transperitoneal approach is used for infrarenal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. An endoscopic approach is contraindicated for patients with large tumors, surgically unfavorable anatomy (eg, multiple small paragangliomas arising at the root of the small bowel mesentery), or radiographic or clinical evidence of local invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17</a>], and may be relatively contraindicated for patients with either dopamine-secreting tumors or <em>SDHB</em> germline mutations because of the high rate of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/17,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,52,53</a>].

While most paragangliomas secrete catecholamines, they can also be nonfunctional, particularly those arising in the skull base and neck.

When defined in this way, durable disease control can be achieved in &gt;90 to 95 percent of benign skull base and neck paragangliomas after conventionally-fractionated external beam RT or SBRT.

The risks of severe long-term sequelae have been improved by modern radiation planning and treatment techniques. (See <a href=\"#H11116526\" class=\"local\">'Radiation side effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with tympanic paragangliomas (Fisch class A and B, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86566 \">table 1</a>)), surgical resection (tympanoplastic surgery) is a reasonable option if there are no contraindications to general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H25256129\" class=\"local\">'Resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Optimal treatment for jugular paragangliomas and for more advanced tympanic paragangliomas is more controversial. The critical anatomic location and vascularity of these tumors make surgical resection complex, and there is a significant risk of serious complications, particularly for advanced (eg, Fisch class C and D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86566 \">table 1</a>)) tumors, in which there is a high risk of postoperative cranial nerve dysfunction. Because of this, we suggest RT rather than resection for most patients, unless they are symptomatic from catecholamine secretion or tumor bulk. (See <a href=\"#H25256349\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3465663\"><span class=\"h2\">Paragangliomas below the neck</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest complete surgical resection rather than RT for all potentially resectable paragangliomas arising in the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Because of the risk of tumor spillage, it is essential to employ circumferential en bloc oncologic technique with every attempt to avoid entry of the tumor capsule. (See <a href=\"#H762615\" class=\"local\">'Paragangliomas below the neck'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When anatomically feasible, endoscopic (laparoscopic or posterior endoscopic) approaches are preferred for resection of abdominal paraganglioma, as long as the tumor is not large or locally invasive. (See <a href=\"#H20515835\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection of <span class=\"nowrap\">thoracic/mediastinal</span> paraganglioma usually requires an open approach and may require cardiac bypass. (See <a href=\"#H20515891\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection of bladder paraganglioma may be accomplished by radical cystectomy or partial cystectomy. If present, enlarged ipsilateral lymph nodes should be removed. (See <a href=\"#H20515898\" class=\"local\">'Bladder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20516204\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term follow-up</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The interval between treatment of a primary paraganglioma and appearance of a recurrence or metastasis may be long, with some recurrences reported up to 20 years after the initial diagnosis. Long-term follow-up is indicated. We suggest radiographic imaging and biochemical testing for catecholamine secretion three to four months postresection. For those patients with catecholamine-secreting tumors, we suggest lifelong annual biochemical follow-up. In those patients with nonfunctioning paragangliomas it is reasonable to obtain biochemical studies and imaging annually for several years and then decrease the frequency of testing. Biochemical testing should be carried out lifelong. (See <a href=\"#H20516661\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H742609154\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and editors would like to recognize Dr. Derrick Lin, who contributed to previous versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">van Duinen N, Steenvoorden D, Kema IP, et al.
