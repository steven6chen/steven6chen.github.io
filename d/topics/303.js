Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for approximately 15 percent of childhood leukemia and is much less common in the pediatric population than acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which accounts for 80 percent of pediatric acute leukemia. Survival rates for AML have greatly improved over the past several decades; however, overall survival for children with AML is approximately 65 to 70 percent and remains lower than for children with ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The improvements in survival have been achieved through clinical trials investigating the role of intensification of therapy, including the use of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), as well as improvements in supportive care. </p><p>This topic will provide an overview of AML in children and adolescents, focusing on issues that are of interest to primary care providers. The pathogenesis of AML and discussions of the molecular genetics and cytogenetics in AML are presented separately.

Similar to those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), patients with AML can present with fever, malaise, musculoskeletal pains, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bleeding. A complete blood count most often reveals anemia and thrombocytopenia and can have decreased, normal, or increased white blood cell (WBC) counts with leukemic myeloblasts noted on the peripheral smear. The less common complications described below may require immediate medical intervention. </p><p>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can be present and can range from mild to severe, especially in some subtypes of AML (eg, acute promyelocytic leukemia). Complications due to the leukemic burden at diagnosis may also include an elevated WBC of <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100,000/microL,</span> leading to leukostasis. (See <a href=\"#H449860011\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> below and <a href=\"#H449859997\" class=\"local\">'Acute promyelocytic leukemia'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of the child with suspected cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Less often, children may present with symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement (eg, headache, lethargy, mental status changes, cranial nerve palsies) or other extramedullary sites. Significant electrolyte derangements and acute kidney injury can occur, especially in those with high WBC or tumor burden. Hepatic dysfunction can also be present at diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H449860011\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449859846\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform the following studies in children with suspected AML:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, glucose, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, uric acid, albumin and total protein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture for evaluation of the CNS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be sent for cell count, protein, glucose, cytology (examination of stained cytospin slides).

Bone marrow aspiration will allow for morphologic and immunophenotypic assessment for definitive diagnosis of AML. This sample is sent for pathologic review, immunophenotyping, metaphase cytogenetics (ie, karyotyping), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), as well as specific molecular testing, which is essential for accurate risk stratification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In some settings, immunophenotypic evaluation by flow cytometry of the peripheral blood can be used for diagnostic purposes; however, this does not replace bone marrow evaluation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected extramedullary disease should have appropriate radiographic imaging of the suspected sites. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for familial acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes consists of a careful medical and family history aimed at identifying signs and symptoms of the known familial syndromes. This is discussed in more detail separately.

AML is distinguished from ALL based on the morphology and immunophenotype of the blasts. Findings on metaphase cytogenetics, FISH, and molecular studies are important for risk stratification. Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis is a standard part of the evaluation of children with newly diagnosed AML. The pathologic features of AML are presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Pathologic features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morphology &ndash; Myeloblasts are immature cells with large nuclei, usually with prominent nucleoli, and a variable amount of pale blue cytoplasm. Typically, myeloid blasts have more abundant cytoplasm compared with lymphoid blasts and may have Auer rods or granules present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78291\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78291 \">picture 1</a>). The morphologic classification of AML has been based upon the French-American-British (FAB) classification that relies on the lineage associated phenotype, ranging from minimally differentiated (FAB M0) to the more mature acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL, FAB M7). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H26565166\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'AML not otherwise specified'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunophenotype &ndash; The immunophenotype of the tumor cells can be determined by flow cytometry or by immunohistochemistry. The tumor cell immunophenotype can rapidly distinguish between AML and ALL. It can also determine myeloid-specific lineage but usually does not substitute for morphologic FAB classification. AML expresses numerous markers, including CD11b, CD34, CD33, CD45, CD64, CD65, CD117, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and lysozyme.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing &ndash; Cytogenetic abnormalities can be detected in approximately 75 percent of pediatric AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although many abnormalities can often be detected by conventional cytogenetics, many cryptic translocations require FISH for more reliable detection. A number of cytogenetic aberrations have prognostic and therapeutic implications. In addition to conventional karyotyping, specific fusions should be evaluated by FISH for at least the following: t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17), and 11q23 translocations. Deeper sequencing can offer a more comprehensive genomic profile, including cryptic fusions not detected by conventional cytogenetics, and many detected abnormalities are becoming increasingly recognized for their importance in therapeutic aspects including risk stratification and disease monitoring.

Routine evaluation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detectable mutations with prognostic relevance including <em>NPM1</em>, <em>CEBPA</em>, <em>FLT3</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/ITD</span> should be evaluated at diagnosis, but additional testing for mutations involving <em>c-KIT</em>, <em>WT1</em> should be performed when possible.

Although information regarding late effects is not as robust as for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), potential late adverse effects include late onset cardiotoxicity, central nervous system (CNS) impairment, decreased linear growth, infertility, cataracts, and an increased incidence of secondary cancers as well as an overall decreased health status due to such factors as neurocognitive dysfunction, depression, fatigue, and anxiety.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for the vast majority of pediatric acute leukemia. In contrast, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is much less common in the pediatric population, representing approximately 15 percent. While survival rates have improved over the past several decades, survival in children with AML is lower than that of children with ALL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with AML commonly present with fever, malaise, musculoskeletal pains, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bleeding. Blood work usually demonstrates anemia and thrombocytopenia. The white blood cell count can be decreased, normal, or increased. Less common complications that may require urgent intervention include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), signs and symptoms related to central nervous system involvement, hyperleukocytosis, and tumor lysis syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H449859839\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic evaluation of children and adolescents with AML should include an evaluation for these potential complications along with a pathologic review of the morphology, immunophenotype, and genetic features. These studies both distinguish AML from ALL and other entities and provide information needed for risk stratification. (See <a href=\"#H449859846\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H449859853\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk stratification takes into account cytogenetic and molecular features as well as response to induction chemotherapy. Treatment on research protocols is recommended as such protocols have helped to standardize treatment, improve survival rates, and decrease complications of therapy. Chemotherapeutic regimens in children and adolescents most often contain two courses of intensive induction chemotherapy followed by either cytarabine-based consolidation or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Central nervous system prophylaxis is a standard component of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H449859963\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although cure rates for children and adolescents with AML have approached 70 percent, outcomes for children with adverse prognostic biologic features and refractory or relapsed disease remains poor. Novel therapies for the high-risk patients are needed. (See <a href=\"#H449860045\" class=\"local\">'Relapsed leukemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H449859894\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for AML is very aggressive and includes intense chemotherapy, and in some cases HCT, and has high rates of acute toxicity, especially infections. Children and adolescents treated for AML should also be monitored closely for long-term complications of treatment regimens and require regular follow-up throughout their lives. (See <a href=\"#H449860011\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H449860052\" class=\"local\">'Late effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk for developing AML.
