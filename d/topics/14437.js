Thus, it is important when reading this topic or any source of information about these substances to ensure that it correlates with the latest version of the WADA prohibited substance list. </p><p>In the past decade, the WADA list of banned performance-enhancing substances has grown to over 192 drugs and methods. In addition to androgens and other hormones, the WADA prohibited list includes stimulants, recreational drugs such as narcotics and cannabinoids, beta agonists, diuretics, and other prescription medications. In 2011, section S0 was added to the WADA list to include substances that have yet to be approved for human use, are still in clinical development, or have been discontinued (S0).

Ephedra is commonly used by athletes to promote alertness, endurance, and strength, although no studies have demonstrated a significant athletic benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The alkaloids in ephedra have been identified as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a>, and phenylpropanolamine. Supplements containing ephedra may be purchased over the counter, and ephedra is included in some cough medicines, decongestants, and diet agents. Adverse effects may be significant, with one sporting fatality in 2003 attributed to the supplement. WADA prohibits urinary concentrations greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> of ephedrine or methylephedrine. Ephedra is reviewed in greater detail separately.

According to a 2007 review article, ephedrine use among track and field athletes may be over 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among respondents to a 2004 survey of United States college hockey players, 38 percent reported using ephedrine, while 46 percent reported using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Survey results from nearly 900 male and female college athletes and non-athletes published in 2008 reported that just over 6 percent of male athletes and 4.5 percent of female athletes used ephedrine, but the surveys did not include pseudoephedrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. According to the 2016 WADA prohibited list, ephedrine may be used in small doses. Urinary cut off levels are listed below. (See <a href=\"#H1044027553\" class=\"local\">'Urine concentration thresholds for selected stimulants'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> for use as a diet aid due to the increased risk of heart attack and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Because of health concerns, in 2011 the United States military removed supplements containing DMAA from military exchanges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and Health Canada classified DMAA as a drug subject to regulation and removed approval of any DMAA-containing products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In 2013 the US FDA made the manufacture and sale of methylhexanamine illegal due to toxicity and side effects. However, DMAA continues to be found as an unacknowledged additive in many sports supplements, particularly those purchased over the Internet, and hence is the cause of many inadvertent violations of anti-doping rules.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">DMAA has numerous other names, such as dimethylpentylamine, pentylamine, geranamine, forthane, and 2-amino-4-methylhexane. Not all these names are included on the WADA prohibited list, creating more confusion. Some supplements label this ingredient as geranium oil or geranium root extract, but analysis has shown that the substance is not a natural ingredient of geranium plants. A health warning on the United States National Center for Biotechnology Information website states that &quot;DMAA, especially when used in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caffeine</a>, can be a health risk elevating blood pressure and leading to cardiovascular problems ranging from shortness of breath to heart attack.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MDMA (ecstasy)</strong> &ndash; While not a performance-enhancing drug (PED) per se, MDMA may give a perception of enhanced energy that some athletes may believe to be helpful.

Oxilofrine increases inotropic cardiac activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although oxilofrine has never been approved for use by the US FDA as either a dietary supplement or pharmaceutical, and is not widely used in the United Kingdom, it has been identified as a contaminant in a variety of supplements, and two well-known sprinters tested positive for this substance in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one study, oxilofrine was identified in 14 different supplements available for over-the-counter purchase in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

It is easily available on the Internet and can be disguised in medications such as methylsynephrine or &quot;Acacia rigidula,&quot; often in dosages that far exceed therapeutic recommendations. Oxilofrine is approved for use in some countries where it is given during anaesthesia and for treatment of orthostatic hypotension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sibutramine </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Sibutramine is a combined serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that acts by increasing thermogenesis and making the user feel fuller after a meal.

Its use in sport was suspended in 2010 in Europe due to associations with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Sibutramine has been detected in weight loss products, and in some cases was not included in the list of ingredients.

The drug is a carnitine analogue that inhibits formation of L-carnitine, which ultimately reduces fatty acid transport into mitochondria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. With less fatty acid available to serve as the substrate for energy production, more carbohydrate is used. Meldonium is usually prescribed for patients with ischemic heart disease, as it reduces oxygen consumption through enhanced glycolysis during ischemia. The reduction in oxygen consumption may translate into improved performance and recovery for endurance athletes. Mildronate was added to the WADA list of banned substances in 2016 after monitoring revealed widespread use during athletic competition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Preclinical trials were abandoned when high doses were linked to increased cancer rates in animals, and WADA has warned athletes of possible serious side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1518264321\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoxia inducible factors (HIF)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIFs are a group of substances banned by WADA and described as peptide hormones, growth factors, and related substances (S2 in the WADA prohibited list). HIFs are transcription factors that mediate the cellular response to hypoxia, which develops in muscles during high intensity exercise. HIFs determine the genetic response to hypoxia, including regulation of erythropoietin production, the metabolic pathways used for energy production, angiogenesis, and iron supply. Autologous HIFs are quickly metabolized in the absence of hypoxia. HIF stabilizers may extend the activity of HIFs, resulting in higher levels of erythropoietin and increased capacity for oxygen transport. HIFs may increase the number of capillaries in skeletal muscles, thereby increasing carbohydrate metabolism and further improving oxygen carrying capacity.</p><p>HIFs are orally bioavailable small molecules developed as anti-anemia therapies. Most are experimental and the subject of clinical trials. They include the following substances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIF stabilizers include cobalt, FG 4592, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (GSK360A).

Desmopressin was added to the WADA list of prohibited substances in 2011 when a study demonstrated substantial hemodilution in athletes, and reductions in plasma concentrations of hemoglobin and other blood parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Desmopressin has been taken to mask use of rhuEPO, taken to modify the hematologic factors used in the WADA Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) program. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of central diabetes insipidus&quot;, section on 'Desmopressin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1398004161\"><span class=\"h2\">Probenecid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Probenecid</a> is an inhibitor of particular transport mechanisms in the renal tubules, and thus blocks excretion of a number of drugs, including anabolic steroids and their metabolites. This results in a more dilute urine with a lower concentration of the prohibited drugs. Athletes may use probenecid to prevent exceeding thresholds for drugs with a urine concentration cut-off.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868643250\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma expanders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma expanders are high molecular weight, biologically inert substances typically used in transfusions or as a blood substitute. Examples include glycerol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, dextran, albumin, and hydroxyethyl starch (HES). These agents have also been used to improve hydration and to mask the use of banned drugs by athletes. When administered, plasma expanders do not readily leave the circulation, and hence exert an osmotic effect pulling fluid into the blood vessels and increasing blood volume. In this way, they may dilute hematologic measurements, such as the hematocrit, important in the ABP, and mask the administration of erythropoietin or erythropoietin-like substances. They are included in the WADA prohibited substance list. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes#H364314742\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of androgens and other hormones by athletes&quot;, section on 'Erythropoietin'</a>.)</p><p>HES, a synthetic polymer derived from amylopectin, persists in the plasma for 17 to 24 weeks and causes plasma volume expansion for up to 24 hours. Side effects include an increased tendency for blood coagulation. Rapid screening tests for HES and dextran are available. Urinary cut-off thresholds for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> are used to distinguish doping from normal dietary intake. Albumin, an endogenous protein, can be administered intravenously, after extraction from whole blood. Some drugs bind to albumin, reducing their excretion rate.

Some food manufacturers add it to processed foods and drinks as an emulsifier, sweetener, and thickener. As with other plasma expanders, glycerol causes fluid retention and temporary expansion of body fluid levels and hence may act as a masking agent against the detection of erythropoietin and its analogues, anabolic steroids, and other banned substances with urinary thresholds. Glycerol also is used to improve performance via hyperhydration. In 2016, WADA prohibited the use of glycerol supplements. Normal daily sources of glycerol do not cause a positive test, as the urinary threshold of 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> is adequate to allow usual daily consumption and use. (See <a href=\"#H1868643250\" class=\"local\">'Plasma expanders'</a> above.)</p><p>Glycerol hyperhydration is a technique used by some primarily endurance athletes to improve performance. The typical dosing range is 1 to 1.5 g of glycerol per kg of body weight mixed with 25 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> bodyweight of fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Approximately 600 to 1000 mL of fluid expansion may be expected over an oral fluid bolus alone, primarily via reduced urinary output. The results of one animal study suggest there is additional benefit if a carbohydrate-electrolyte solution is used instead of water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. A meta-analysis of studies of glycerol versus water hyperhydration in endurance athletes concluded that glycerol hyperhydration improves fluid balance and endurance performance compared to water&ndash;based approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Hyperhydration with glycerol before exercise in a hot environment can help to reduce fluid deficits and to prevent the diuresis that occurs with aggressive standard hydration practices, which are common in weight-restricted sports after weigh in. Side effects can be significant and may include nausea, vomiting, and headache.</p><p>As glycerol is banned by WADA, high performance athletes subject to doping control should not use glycerol hyperhydration. However, this technique may benefit individuals who are active for prolonged periods in hot environments (eg, firefighters, military personnel, recreational endurance athletes). Glycerol hyperhydration may be useful for the management of dehydration, allowing an earlier return to exercise, but the approach is banned for competitive athletes, in and out of competition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H220727151\"><span class=\"h2\">Other agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although previously designated a masking agent, epi-testosterone is now classified as an anabolic agent.

This makes detection difficult and reinforces the importance of a good therapeutic alliance between clinician and athlete when obtaining a medical history. Clinicians should help to educate athletes about the potential harms of supplements marketed as performance enhancers, which may be sold online, through magazines, or at health fitness stores. It is best not to accuse athletes of drug use. Detection of non-hormonal performance enhancement use is possible when there is patient-clinician trust and supporting symptoms and signs. It can often be confirmed with urine testing or blood testing.</p><p>When an athlete presents with symptoms and signs consistent with the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), it is important to take a thorough history and perform a standard physical examination (see <a href=\"#H2613542515\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and signs'</a> below). Then the clinician should discuss the possible diagnoses with the athlete, and the likely causative or contributing factors, including the possible role of PEDs. It is appropriate at this stage to ask the athlete if they have been using any such substance.</p><p>In other circumstances, a third party may raise concerns about a particular athlete or group of athletes that a clinician helps to care for or is involved with in some way. In such cases, it may be possible to mention to a particular athlete that someone has raised questions about PEDs and to ask if they are aware of such activity. It is important to be honest and frank but not accusatory. There may be situations, such as when there is a risk of significant morbidity or death, or where there is evidence of widespread misuse among a group of athletes or teams that may be sanctioned by sporting officials, where it is appropriate for information to be given to drug enforcement agencies on an anonymous basis. Most anti-doping agencies have a process for the public to provide anonymous information regarding anti-doping violations. However, medical practitioners must be careful not to breach patient-doctor confidentiality laws and guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2613542515\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When PED use is suspected, the clinician should look for presenting symptoms that seem unusual or do not make sense. Initial symptoms and signs may include any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden onset of sleep problems without other explanation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relatively acute changes in mood, energy, or body weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychomotor retardation, dysphoria, hypervigilance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations, jitteriness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood pressure and heart rate elevation not attributable to other causes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained or unusual medical conditions not attributable to other causes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other physical changes (eg, acne)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypokalemia in a fit, otherwise healthy athlete</p><p/><p>Competitive athletes may be more susceptible to pressure or the temptation to use non-hormonal PEDs at particular times, such as early during the preseason, during the height of the competitive season, or when recovering from an injury. During the pre-season, athletes may take PEDs to increase muscle mass and tolerate higher loads of training, and they may believe they are less likely to be tested at this time. The pressure to return to play after an acute injury can lead players to use non-hormonal performance enhancing drugs, particularly in team sports.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2811585306\"><span class=\"h2\">Athlete biological passport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of the athlete biological passport (ABP) is to monitor selected athlete variables (referred to as biomarkers of doping) over time that indirectly reveal the effects of doping. This approach stands in contrast to traditional detection methods based on direct testing for the presence of illicit substances in urine or blood.</p><p>The ABP has two active modules:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematological Module &#8210; Introduced in 2009, the hematological module is used to help identify illicit interventions to enhance oxygen transport, use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), and any form of blood transfusion or manipulation. Blood tests are used to follow relevant biomarkers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroidal Module &#8210; Introduced in 2014, the steroidal module is used to help identify endogenous anabolic androgenic steroids administered exogenously, and other anabolic agents, such as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMS). Urine tests are used to follow relevant biomarkers.</p><p/><p>Following collection of appropriate samples, the athlete must complete the ABP doping control form, which includes question about the following items:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the athlete trained at an altitude above 1500 m during the two weeks prior to the test (information includes location, duration of stay, and altitude).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the athlete used a hypoxia tent or any other type of altitude simulation during the two weeks prior to the test (information includes the exact device and how it was used).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirmation that the athlete had not participated in training or competition in the two hours prior to sample collection.</p><p/><p>In addition to the hematological and steroidal modules, WADA is developing an endocrine module to help detect the use of growth factors. Over the longer term, WADA wishes to develop a large panel of doping biomarkers to improve monitoring. The ABP is not intended to replace traditional testing, but serves as an important complement making anti-doping programs more effective.</p><p>The ABP involves a series of mandatory protocols relating to sample collection, analysis, and legal considerations that ensure scientific quality and legal standing, and enable mutual recognition and data sharing among anti-doping organizations. The Athlete Passport Management Unit (APMU) is responsible for the administration of the ABP, and ideally it works alongside WADA accredited laboratories. The APMUs are established by WADA or a regional anti-doping organization. They liaise with an expert panel, which reviews test results, interprets the longitudinal data, suggests follow-up testing, and provides an opinion on atypical passport findings to the relevant International Sporting Federation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1808745153\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Athletes undergoing urine testing only must complete a doping notification form with the doping control officer. On the form, they must note any medication or supplement that they have taken in the last seven days and confirm that they accept the testing protocol. Testing protocols may vary at individual sites, but the standard method of testing in athletes is a split sample urine test and high performance liquid chromatography analysis. A split sample involves dividing the initial urine collection into two separate containers, labeled &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; samples. The samples are then sent to the certified testing lab, following strict chain of custody protocols. The &quot;A&quot; sample is run first, and, if positive for a banned drug, the athlete is notified of the positive test and informed that the &quot;B&quot; sample will be run to confirm the result. The athlete and a representative are permitted to be present at the running of the &quot;B&quot; sample, unless they waive their right to have the B sample tested. A brief description of the immunoassays and other methods used to detect the presence of drugs, particularly common drugs of abuse, is provided separately; a table summarizing common urine drug testing assays follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F95110\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95110 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testing-for-drugs-of-abuse-doa#H192794423\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testing for drugs of abuse (DOA)&quot;, section on 'Specific drug assays: Methods and capabilities'</a>.)</p><p>If a positive test is confirmed by the &quot;B&quot; sample, the results are turned over to a medical review officer or panel for appropriate follow-up. If the initial &quot;A&quot; test is negative, the &quot;B&quot; sample is not tested. If authorities suspect that PEDs may have been used but current tests are inadequate for detection, in some jurisdictions urine samples may be stored and frozen for up to 10 years and then reassessed using newly developed tests. In the past several years, many athletes have received sanctions for using performance-enhancing substances when the drugs were detected in stored urine, which was subsequently tested with more accurate methods.</p><p>The length of time a banned substance remains in the body and detectable depends on a number of clinical variables, including the half-life of the drug, other medications being taken (eg, diuretics and other masking agents), and other specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic factors. (See <a href=\"#H1864859659\" class=\"local\">'Agents used to prevent detection of banned substances'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2363245631\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood testing is used to detect prohibited substances and other methods of performance enhancement (eg, enhancement of oxygen transport - including use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), hemoglobin oxygen carriers (HBOCs), and any form of blood transfusion or manipulation). It is also used for long-term monitoring of an athlete's biological variables, in accordance with the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) Guidelines.</p><p>The equipment used for blood collection and post-collection processing differs depending on the type of analysis required. The blood sample collection kit includes a sterile needle, syringe and the relevant vacutainers in a sealed bag. Whole blood or plasma is used for tests to detect blood transfusions, HBOCs and ESAs and is collected in two 3 mL EDTA tubes (A and B samples). For detection of growth hormone, along with ESAs and HBOCs, two 5 mL tubes (A and B samples) with a polymeric serum separator gel and an activated clotting factor is required. For the ABP, one EDTA tube of whole blood is required.</p><p>As per WADA protocol, athletes choose a sample kit randomly from a number of kits (usually three) made available by the doping control officer to ensure freedom of choice and reduce the possibility of kit manipulation. The athlete ensures that seals are intact and without signs of tampering. No more than three attempts to insert a needle into an athlete's vein may be attempted. Tamperproof collection bottles are filled, labeled, prepared, and then stored or transported using standard protocols. Following blood collection not intended for the ABP, doping control forms are completed, including the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any medications or supplements the athlete has taken in the previous seven days.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the athlete has received any blood transfusions in the previous three months and if so, an explanation of why it was necessary.</p><p/><p>Blood samples must be carefully stored after collection and maintained at temperatures between 2 and 12&deg;C.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066762273\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC USE EXEMPTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3030580648\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition and criteria for exemption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On occasion, an athlete will require a &quot;therapeutic use exemption&quot; (TUE) in order to use a prohibited substance for treatment of a medical condition. Exemptions are granted only when there is no unfair advantage to be gained by the athlete from taking the prohibited substance or using the prohibited method. In most cases, exemption involves a medical condition that must be treated with a particular medication, or group of medications, and no viable alternative treatment is available. Examples of possible TUEs include stimulants for treatment of ADHD and testosterone for treatment of hypogonadism following treatment for testicular cancer.</p><p>General information and guidelines for TUEs, including explanations of the roles of different organizations (eg, national anti-doping organizations [NADOs], International Federations [IFs], major event organizers [MEOs]) are available at the <a href=\"https://wada-main-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wada-guidelines_tue-v7.0-en.pdf.pdf&amp;token=27GOJWZIvnnIghVMQmPdzDeIGGrmNUtIGEHdEuTHC9YZTcF+O/VGYRuVE174mpQoBeLxrncZKScQKJa5KuNgObFdMIyeckSUzLe1T9KPJvw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15454\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">WADA website</a>.</p><p>Information for physicians who are completing TUE applications for specific medical conditions is available through the WADA (<a href=\"http://www.wada-ama.org/&amp;token=mERgK95VGrINLJ8fzNtMZ0/OuiRADt2nFoG5ROXvSmuvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=15454\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.wada-ama.org</a>).</p><p>The criteria for a TUE as defined by WADA are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prohibited substance or method is needed to treat an acute or chronic medical condition, such that the athlete would suffer a significant impairment to their health if the substance or method were withheld.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The therapeutic use of the prohibited substance or method is highly unlikely to produce any additional enhancement of performance beyond what might be anticipated by a return to the athlete's normal state of health post-treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no reasonable therapeutic alternative to the prohibited substance or method.</p><p/><p>Several points should be noted regarding treatment alternatives:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only valid and referenced medications are considered as alternatives. This means the medication must be registered in the athlete's country of residence, prescribed by an appropriately qualified clinician, and compelling evidence of medical necessity provided to the appropriate authority.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definition of what constitutes a &quot;valid and referenced&quot; medication may vary from one country to another. These differences should be taken into account. As an example, a medication may be registered in one country and not in another, or approval by a government authority may be pending.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There may be instances when it is not appropriate to use alternatives to the medication containing the prohibited substance. This may occur in a medical emergency or in a situation where the medical condition is serious and treatment must be administered quickly. This may occur when for example glucocorticoids are needed to treat severe asthma or a malignancy. In such cases, a physician must provide an explanation of why the medication is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A TUE will not be issued to an athlete for treatment of a condition that stems directly from use of a prohibited substance. As an example, an athlete would not be permitted to use an androgenic steroid in order to treat an aromatizing or androgenizing side-effect from having used such an agent in the past.</p><p/><p>For elite athletes included in the registered testing pool for their sport, or participating on their national team or at a national championship, TUEs must be issued prospectively so the athlete can begin taking the medication after the appropriate authority has given approval. Such an athlete applies to their respective NADO, IF, or MEO, using the TUE application form available for download at the NADOs website. If the athlete commences use of the prohibited substance or method prior to approval from the relevant NADO, they do so at their own risk, and may be subject to an anti-doping violation in the event the TUE is denied.

Blood transfusion is among the most common. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) regulations (section M1) specifically ban the manipulation of blood and blood components, including the following actions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration or reintroduction of any quantity of autologous, allogeneic (homologous), or heterologous blood or red blood cell products of any origin into the circulatory system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Artificial means for enhancing the uptake, transport, or delivery of oxygen. Including, but not limited to: perfluorochemicals, efaproxiral (RSR13), and modified hemoglobin products (eg, hemoglobin-based blood substitutes and microencapsulated hemoglobin products). Supplemental oxygen is <strong>not</strong> proscribed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any form of intravascular manipulation of the blood or blood components by physical or chemical means.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16909112\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood transfusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood transfusions can be autologous (using one's own blood) or allogenic (ie, homologous; using blood from a different person) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In sports requiring endurance, blood transfusions can be used to increase the number of erythrocytes and oxygen carrying capacity of the blood to improve performance and speed recovery. Blood transfusions prior to athletic competitions to enhance performance are prohibited by the WADA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/5,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,51</a>].<strong> </strong>Platelet-rich plasma and other platelet-derived preparations contain growth factors and are used to treat injury, but they are not prohibited by WADA, as no specific performance-enhancing effect has been demonstrated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of overuse (chronic) tendinopathy&quot;, section on 'Dry needling and autologous blood/platelet rich plasma injection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-approaches-to-the-management-of-osteoarthritis#H1593283291\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational approaches to the management of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Platelet-rich plasma'</a>.)</p><p>Potential adverse effects from blood transfusions include sudden fluctuations in blood pressure, stimulation of atherosclerosis, oxidative damage to organs, impaired blood cell function, blood-borne infections, and iron deposition in organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult#H89426930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;, section on 'Risks and complications of transfusion'</a>.)</p><p>Autologous blood transfusions cannot be detected by direct testing. Homologous transfusions can be detected through surface antigen patterns using flow cytometry, which is highly sensitive and able to detect rare antigenically distinct cells in an athlete's sample. As the life of a red blood cell is three to four months, detection can be made up to several weeks after a transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>As the ability to test for exogenous erythropoietin has improved, the use of blood transfusions has increased in sport. The athlete biological passport (ABP) is designed to detect sudden or unusual increases in an athlete's hemoglobin, hematocrit, and other indices of red blood cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes#H364314742\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of androgens and other hormones by athletes&quot;, section on 'Erythropoietin'</a> and <a href=\"#H2811585306\" class=\"local\">'Athlete biological passport'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H657657155\"><span class=\"h2\">Artificial oxygen carriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Artificial oxygen carriers, such as hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) and perfluorocarbons, bind and deliver oxygen to tissues such as skeletal muscle. They have been used in select situations involving acute blood loss such as trauma and cardiac surgery. These compounds have a short half-life, so need to be given intravenously at the time of need. All such compounds are banned under WADA regulations because of the possibility of performance enhancement. HBOCs and synthetic hemoglobin impart a red color to the urine, making detection straightforward in most cases. </p><p>Free hemoglobin is toxic, particularly to the kidneys, and thus several techniques have been developed to prevent such injury. These techniques, including polymerization, cross-linking, conjugation, and encapsulation, have led to the development of compounds referred to as HBOCs. First generation HBOCs were reported to cause vasoconstriction, which impairs oxygen release to tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Third generation HBOCs involve enclosing the contents of erythrocytes (hemoglobin and particular enzymes) within artificial erythrocytes (liposomes or biodegradable nanocapsules) or modifying them using complex conjugations. These newer HBOCs appear to be highly effective oxygen donors and may cause less vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>Reported effects of third generation HBOCs include increased concentrations of erythropoietin, serum iron, and serum ferritin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>], and improved exercise capacity compared with autologous transfusion in untrained healthy males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Complications from HBOCs may include gastrointestinal dysfunction, renal toxicity, hypertension, and platelet dysfunction. Reactive oxygen radicals, a byproduct of the increased amounts of oxygen formed from HBOCs, may cause the tissue damage noted in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Significant safety concerns were raised in phase II and III clinical trials of some HBOCs and this has slowed development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, there remain a number of compounds being studied in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Several reports describe possession and administration of HBOCs among professional cyclists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Emulsions of perfluorocarbon dissolve high concentrations of oxygen and thus can serve as effective oxygen providers to oxygen-deprived tissues. These are synthetic organic, highly fluorinated compounds, and the amount of oxygen dissolved in the emulsions correlates directly with the partial pressure of oxygen. Thus, perfluorocarbons require an environment with a high oxygen concentration to be effective, which is not easily achievable during athletic competition. Perfluorocarbons may cause back pain, fatigue, transient fevers, and clotting dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. There are no published reports of athletes using PFCs, and no studies have been performed on the possible ergogenic effect of PFCs during exercise.</p><p>Whether PFCs and HBOCs improve athletic performance remains a subject of debate. Neither responds to endogenous 2,3 DPG (2,3 BPG) and therefore both are probably less effective at improving oxygenation than transfusions of red blood cells. In addition, HBOCs may cause vasoconstriction, which would limit oxygen delivery to tissues, and may even impair performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Serum testing using an electrophoretic method is fast, effective, and sensitive, and is used as a screening test for anti-doping samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1954438906\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WADA list of prohibited methods (section M2) includes intravenous infusions, which may be used to offset dehydration during endurance events. Intravenous infusions or injections of more than 50 mL of fluid per 6 hour period, except for those legitimately received in the course of medical treatment, a surgical procedure, or clinical investigation, are not permitted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H760260509\"><span class=\"h2\">Gene doping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Gene doping&quot; is the application of gene therapy techniques to enhance athletic performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. In 2001, WADA declared that the &quot;non-therapeutic use of cells, genes, genetic elements, or the modulation of genetic expression, having the capacity to enhance athletic performance, is prohibited.&quot;</p><p>Thus, neither of the following actions is permitted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfer of polymers of nucleic acids or nucleic acid analogues with the potential to enhance sport performance</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of normal or genetically modified cells with the potential to enhance sport performance</p><p/><p>Candidate genes have been identified that increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood through increased production of erythropoietin, vascular endothelial factor, and other angiogenic factors, and that increase strength through stimulation of type I and type II muscle fibers, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I, and myostatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/59,61-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,61-65</a>]. Using laboratory methods, gene doping has been demonstrated to improve endurance, strength, and tissue repair in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/59,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,61,62</a>].

Inactivation of the myostatin gene resulted in marked muscle hypertrophy in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>To date, there is no evidence of gene doping by human athletes. However, WADA is sufficiently concerned to include gene doping in its official list of banned methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/59,61,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,61,69</a>]. The potential for performance enhancement and extension of an athlete's career through improved healing capacity, along with the inherent difficulty in detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>], increase the risk for this form of abuse. The potentially serious risks to the health of the athlete, and possibly others (eg, exposure to viral gene vectors), and the unfair advantage gained by cheaters, justify the need for close monitoring and an aggressive education campaign. Examples of possible health risks include inadequately regulated increases in erythropoietin expression that may cause significant polycythemia, and increases in IGF-1 or growth hormone that could stimulate production of malignant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Although the prospects for gene doping are theoretical at present, improvements in genetic technology should be monitored closely and further research aimed at detecting genetic manipulation is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prohibited-non-hormonal-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-sport/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Monitoring may involve identifying specific substances (consistent with current methods for detection), but also patterns of changes that may occur as a response to genetic modification.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16910913\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians involved in the care of competitive athletes should be aware of doping regulations, particularly as some banned drugs may be taken for medical purposes (eg, diuretics, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors). The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) maintains a list of prohibited substances, which includes stimulants, recreational drugs (eg, opioids, cannabinoids), beta-agonists, diuretics, and other prescription medications.
