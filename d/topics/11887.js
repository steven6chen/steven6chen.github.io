The patient's hepatic reserve often dictates therapeutic options (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56735 \">table 1</a>). Treatment options are divided into surgical therapies (ie, resection, cryoablation, and orthotopic liver transplantation [OLT]), and nonsurgical therapies (ie, percutaneous ethanol injection [PEI], radiofrequency ablation [RFA], transarterial chemoembolization [TACE], radioembolization, radiation therapy [RT], and systemic therapy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment algorithms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A general approach to the treatment of HCC is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57014\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57014 \">algorithm 1</a>).

However, attempts to generate algorithmic approaches to the treatment of HCC are difficult since new treatments and indications for various treatments are evolving rapidly. Furthermore, therapeutic approaches tend to vary based upon the available expertise, as well as variability in the criteria for hepatic resection and orthotopic liver transplantation. These issues and a general approach to treatment of HCC are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457345914\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of comprehensive multidisciplinary care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A majority of patients with HCC have underlying liver disease, which may be related to infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatitis C virus (HCV). Furthermore, patients who undergo any of these forms of therapy are at high risk for recurrent disease and of progression to liver failure. It is important that patients with more advanced liver disease have proper monitoring and assessment of their underlying liver disease, which may have a major impact on longer term survival. Prognostic scoring systems to assess the severity of underlying liver disease in patients undergoing treatment for HCC are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Staging and prognostic scoring systems'</a>.)</p><p>Comprehensive care of patients with cirrhosis includes antiviral therapy for HBV and HCV, immunization against hepatitis A and HBV (if indicated), and endoscopic screening and surveillance for varices. In addition, the wide variety of treatment options for these patients (surgical, interventional, medical, radiation) involves different types of specialists. Thus, the multidisciplinary team necessary to comprehensively evaluate and care for these patients requires significant breadth.

At least two meta-analyses have demonstrated the superiority of RFA over PEI in terms of survival, cancer-free survival, and local recurrence. For patients who are reasonable surgical candidates, most clinicians consider that surgery is preferred over RFA, if it is feasible, even for small tumors.</p><p>RFA relies on a needle electrode to deliver a high frequency alternating current from the tip of an electrode into the tissue surrounding that electrode. As the ions within the tissue attempt to follow the change in the direction of the alternating current, their movement results in frictional heating of the tissue.

The device we have used most frequently is a 14-gauge, 15 to 25 cm long, insulated cannula containing 10 individual hook-shaped electrode arms or tines. Upon deployment, the array of tines extends out to a diameter of 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, or 4.0 cm. Tumors &lt;3 cm in greatest diameter can be ablated with the placement of a needle electrode with an array diameter of 3.5 cm when the electrode is positioned in the center of the tumor.</p><p>Using US to guide placement, the needle electrode is advanced into the area of the tumor to be treated. Once the tines have been extended or deployed into the tissue, the needle electrode is attached to a radiofrequency generator and treatment is performed.</p><p>RFA can predictably produce an ablation area of 3 cm at a single application. Tumors &gt;3 cm require more than one deployment of the needle electrode. In one series of 1000 RFA procedures (2140 nodules) in 664 patients, tumor size was 2, 2.1 to 5, and &gt;5 cm in 200, 424, and 40 patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-radiofrequency-ablation-percutaneous-ethanol-injection-thermal-ablation-and-cryoablation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. All nodules were ablated completely, and the mean number of electrode insertions according to tumor size was: 1.5 times for nodules &lt;2 cm, and 2.3, 4.2, and 11.7 times for nodules 2.1 to 3, 3.1 to 5, and &gt;5 cm, respectively.</p><p>Typically, the array is first placed at the most posterior interface between the tumor and nonmalignant liver parenchyma and then repositioned for repeat deployments anteriorly at 2.0 to 2.5 cm intervals within the tissue.

Disease extent and the patient's hepatic reserve dictate the therapeutic options. Local ablation is commonly accepted as the best option for patients with small HCCs who are not candidates for surgical resection or liver transplantation. Several methods are available for local ablation, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), and laser and microwave thermal ablation. Patients with disease spread outside of the liver are usually considered for systemic therapy rather than liver-directed therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment algorithms'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A majority of patients with HCC have underlying liver disease, which may be related to infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatitis C virus (HCV). Furthermore, patients who undergo any of these forms of therapy are at high risk for recurrent disease and of progression to liver failure. It is important that patients with more advanced liver disease have proper monitoring and assessment of their underlying liver disease, which may have a major impact on longer term survival. (See <a href=\"#H457345914\" class=\"local\">'Importance of comprehensive multidisciplinary care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend RFA rather than PEI for those who do not meet resectability criteria for HCC and yet are candidates for a liver-directed procedure based upon the presence of liver-only disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Although there is no absolute tumor size beyond which RFA should not be considered, the best outcomes are in patients with a one or two lesions &lt;4 cm. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Radiofrequency ablation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">RFA can be performed percutaneously, laparoscopically, or by an open (laparotomy) route. Although the open approach may be more effective, at least in the United States, most patients are treated by interventional radiologists using the percutaneous approach. Tumors at the inferior edge of the liver should not be treated percutaneously (and instead by a laparoscopic or open approach, or by an alternative means of local ablation such as PEI) if the stomach, duodenum, or transverse colon lies in close proximity to the tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although some institutions routinely combine transarterial chemoembolization plus RFA for larger lesions (&gt;2 cm), in our view, the data are insufficient to conclude that there is benefit for combining transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus RFA as compared to RFA alone, in patients who are appropriately selected for RFA. For larger lesions (3 to 5 cm), RFA plus TACE is an alternative to TACE alone that may provide greater survival. (See <a href=\"#H104900276\" class=\"local\">'RFA plus TACE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PEI is uncomfortable and requires more treatment sessions than RFA; in addition, it can be difficult to visualize the limits of the lesion on ultrasound because of the bubbles formed during the alcohol injection. We typically reserve PEI for treatment of small HCCs (&le;3 cm) in patients who are not suitable candidates for surgery whose tumors are in locations that are unsuitable for percutaneous RFA, such as adjacent to the gallbladder. (See <a href=\"#H950876074\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous ethanol injection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consensus as to the best way to assess benefit from locoregional ablative therapies. Bidimensional perpendicular measurements of tumor dimensions before and after treatment are not useful as they disregard the extent of necrosis. Guidelines from the European Association for Study of the Liver (EASL) suggest that estimated reduction in viable tumor burden (nonenhanced areas using dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging techniques) be incorporated into definitions for response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-radiofrequency-ablation-percutaneous-ethanol-injection-thermal-ablation-and-cryoablation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In patients with elevated serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), this marker can be useful to follow response and provide an early screening test for progression by imaging.
