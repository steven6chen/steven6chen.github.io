A family history of similar manifestations is supportive. The skin changes usually are localized to areas of trauma but are out of proportion to the degree of trauma. EB should be considered in any neonate who presents with blisters <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erosions in the absence of another plausible etiology (eg, infection). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vesiculopustular-and-bullous-lesions-in-the-newborn-and-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vesiculopustular and bullous lesions in the newborn and infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In older children and adults, scarring, milia, nail dystrophy, oral involvement, or other organ involvement may suggest the EB subtype.

IFM is sufficient for diagnosis if it identifies the level or cleavage and the subtype; this occurs in most cases. If IFM is normal or fails to demonstrate the level of cleavage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subtype, the diagnosis can be confirmed with either transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or mutational analysis. In some cases, mutational analysis can be considered a first-line test for EB. If possible, a venous blood sample should be obtained at the initial visit (or consultation in the neonatal unit); it should be stored to allow subsequent DNA extraction in the event that mutational analysis becomes necessary. </p><p>Many local laboratories are able to determine the type of EB, based on the cleavage level determined by immunohistochemistry with antibodies to collagen IV and keratin 14. However, the accurate identification of the EB subtype is performed only in specialized laboratories and requires IFM with specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeting EB-specific proteins, TEM, or mutational analysis. Identifying and contacting the laboratory before the biopsy is performed will ensure that the specimen is obtained and processed appropriately. Information on the centers for the diagnosis and treatment of EB is available from the website of the Dystrophic EB Research Association (DebRA)-International at <a href=\"http://www.debra-international.org/&amp;token=c8zehlRlllChWb7EVG9Nq9JPxxxSLW9VNKahrWiPAaJNYlCgtgHgl7/PVbvUv46P&amp;TOPIC_ID=15452\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.debra-international.org</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22232119\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with suspected EB should undergo skin biopsy of an induced blister for IFM; TEM may be necessary if IFM is inconclusive or normal. Although TEM may not be necessary in some cases, it is most practical to perform biopsies for both studies at the same time. IFM and TEM identify the level of skin cleavage, morphologic alterations of epithelial adhesion structures in the basement membrane zone, and defective expression of adhesion proteins at the dermal-epidermal junction. </p><p>Routine histology of an EB lesion typically shows a noninflammatory intra- or subepidermal blister and is not helpful in establishing the EB type. However, routine histology may be useful to exclude other etiologies of bullous or erosive lesions, particularly in the neonate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vesiculopustular-and-bullous-lesions-in-the-newborn-and-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vesiculopustular and bullous lesions in the newborn and infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2394298\"><span class=\"h3\">Obtaining biopsies for EB diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper technique is critical when biopsying for EB diagnosis since submission of suboptimal specimens (eg, due to no blister, no epidermis, or reepithelialization) is a relatively common reason why IFM <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> TEM cannot be performed or do not yield a diagnosis. Accurate interpretation of IFM and TEM requires examination of fresh blisters. When blisters are more than 12 hours old, proteolytic antigen degradation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reepithelialization under the roof of the blister may result in artifactual cleavage planes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A fresh blister is usually induced in an area of skin that is clinically uninvolved but adjacent to a site where the patient usually blisters. The palms and soles should be avoided because the increased skin thickness in these areas makes the identification of the cleavage site difficult. To avoid unnecessary repetition of the procedure, it is important that the fresh blister is induced by a clinician with expertise in EB. </p><p>Administration of topical anesthetics (such as EMLA under occlusion) before local anesthesia should be avoided because topical anesthetics may induce artificial blistering, especially in the epidermis. </p><p>After identifying the biopsy site, the area is prepared in a sterile manner and outlined. Experts disagree as to the optimal agent for producing the blister; a cotton-swab, pencil eraser, or gloved finger or thumb may be used. Firm, downward pressure is applied to the skin, and a traction is then exerted by rubbing or twisting (at least 180 degrees each way) until erythema is produced (the biopsy site is recleaned after the blister is induced) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F60027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60027 \">picture 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The amount of friction necessary to induce a subclinical blister may vary from patient to patient, but the development of erythema at the site is a good endpoint. For newborns or infants, a reasonable rule of thumb is to rub the selected area at least 20 times.</p><p>For patients with milder skin fragility, up to two minutes of induced friction can be necessary to induce the blister. It may be helpful to ask older children or adults with milder skin fragility to perform an activity that induces a fresh blister before a clinic appointment for biopsy. </p><p>A biopsy of unaffected, nonrubbed skin may be required in patients with extreme mechanical skin fragility (a characteristic feature of recessive EB). In these patients, performing a punch biopsy may be sufficient to induce the cleavage plane necessary for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Biopsies are performed at least five minutes after the induction of erythema to allow the development of a microscopically identifiable blister. The biopsy site is cleaned with an antiseptic solution (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> stings less than alcohol) and draped. Two separate biopsies from adjacent sites are taken. Most laboratories prefer punch biopsies over shave biopsies because punched specimens are easier to orient and embed for frozen sections. Approximately one-third to one-half of each biopsy should include the induced blister, with the remaining portion composed of unaffected skin. A larger biopsy may be split in two, but this procedure is not recommended since it might separate the epidermis from the dermis with loss of the diagnostic cleavage plane. </p><p>Biopsies should be sent to a laboratory experienced in the diagnosis of EB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Identifying and contacting the laboratory before the biopsy is performed will ensure that the specimen is obtained and processed appropriately. Information on the centers for the diagnosis and treatment of EB is available from the website of the Dystrophic EB Research Association (DebRA)-International at <a href=\"http://www.debra-international.org/&amp;token=c8zehlRlllChWb7EVG9Nq9JPxxxSLW9VNKahrWiPAaJNYlCgtgHgl7/PVbvUv46P&amp;TOPIC_ID=15452\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.debra-international.org</a>. </p><p>For IFM, a 3 or 4 mm biopsy is immersed immediately in Michel's transport medium (ammonium sulfate, N-ethyl-maleimide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a>, potassium citrate buffer, and distilled water; the correct pH buffering is important) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is essential to avoid contamination of the IFM sample with formalin or TEM fixative to preserve antigen expression. If an autoimmune blistering disease is in the differential diagnosis, the same sample can be tested for direct immunofluorescence by the same laboratory.

(See <a href=\"#H4214194\" class=\"local\">'Mutational analysis'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of the EB subtype by IF mapping is performed in specialized laboratories and involves the use of panels of specific monoclonal antibodies that target EB-specific proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction. A panel of EB-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and their corresponding proteins is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67732 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>The determination of the patient's underlying molecular defect is based upon the staining intensity (normal, reduced, or absent) of EB-specific proteins. Absent or attenuated staining of specific proteins is diagnostic for a specific EB subtype. As an example, in severe recessive dystrophic EB (DEB), the staining of type VII collagen is absent, whereas in other generalized or localized subtypes of DEB the expression of type VII collagen is reduced or variable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62232\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62232 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>IFM effectively functions as an assay of protein expression in the skin, which may better predict overall disease severity than mutational analysis. IFM demonstrates protein expression in areas of revertant mosaicism, a relatively common phenomenon in junctional and recessive dystrophic EB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], and in cases of splicing mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Information on centers for the diagnosis and treatment of EB is available from the website of the Dystrophic EB Research Association (DebRA)-International at <a href=\"http://www.debra-international.org/&amp;token=c8zehlRlllChWb7EVG9Nq9JPxxxSLW9VNKahrWiPAaJNYlCgtgHgl7/PVbvUv46P&amp;TOPIC_ID=15452\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.debra-international.org</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22232179\"><span class=\"h3\">Transmission electron microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has historically been the initial diagnostic test for EB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, several drawbacks limit its widespread use now that IFM is available: it is time-consuming, labor-intensive, expensive, operator-dependent, potentially more subjective in its interpretation, and available only in a few specialized centers. However, TEM may be helpful for determining the level of skin separation and is used in some instances to confirm or refine the diagnosis obtained by immunofluorescence mapping (IFM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As an example, in milder forms of EB, particularly those inherited in a dominant manner, IFM may be normal, whereas TEM can identify microsplits and other ultrastructural abnormalities at the dermal-epidermal junction. </p><p>TEM utilizes a magnification of 3000 to 30,000X, which allows the visualization of the level of skin cleavage and morphology of the structural components of the dermal-epidermal junction, including keratin intermediate filaments, hemidesmosomes, and anchoring fibrils. TEM is of particular use in diagnosing EB simplex, generalized severe (formerly called Dowling-Meara), a subtype of EB simplex. In this form of EB, IFM may show no abnormality, except an intraepidermal split, whereas TEM demonstrates the characteristic aggregation of keratin intermediate filaments in the basal keratinocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Many laboratories are able to work with as little as 2 or 2.5 mL of blood. Contacting the laboratory to discuss feasibility and requirements before obtaining the specimen is advised.</p><p>Mutational analysis is recommended to confirm the exact EB diagnosis. The sensitivity of mutation analysis ranges from 60 to 95 percent and depends upon the affected gene and techniques used for analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-epidermolysis-bullosa/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

However, this paradigm may change as next-generation sequencing, which has reduced overall genetic testing cost and turnaround time, becomes more widely available. Mutational analysis is recommended to confirm the EB diagnosis and is critical in patients with suspected Kindler syndrome, when the inheritance pattern is not clear, in families with a severely affected child, or when prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnoses are planned.
