This group of problems is called &quot;altitude sickness.&quot;</p><p>The 3 main types of altitude sickness are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute mountain sickness</strong> &ndash; This is the most common type and causes symptoms like those caused by an alcohol hangover.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High altitude cerebral edema</strong> (also called &quot;HACE&quot;) &ndash; This is less common but more serious than acute mountain sickness. It involves swelling of the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High altitude pulmonary edema</strong> (also called &quot;HAPE&quot;) &ndash; This is also less common and more serious than acute mountain sickness. It involves fluid buildup in the lungs.</p><p/><p>If you are planning to go somewhere at high altitude, there are things you can do to keep from getting altitude sickness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2352864\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of altitude sickness?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms differ depending on the type of altitude sickness you have.</p><p>Acute mountain sickness can happen within a day of traveling or climbing to a very high altitude. The symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling lightheaded</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having no appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, sometimes with vomiting</p><p/><p>If you have these symptoms, do not travel or climb any higher until you feel better. You should feel better within a day or so.</p><p>The symptoms of HACE (swelling of the brain) usually start 1 to 3 days after traveling or climbing to at a high altitude. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme tiredness and weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking normally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion and irritability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting drunk</p><p/><p>The symptoms of HAPE (fluid in the lungs) usually start 2 to 4 days after traveling or climbing to a high altitude. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling breathless</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking uphill</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2352879\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have mild symptoms of acute mountain sickness, you should rest. Do not travel or climb to a higher altitude until you feel better. Moving to a lower altitude can also help, if symptoms do not go away in a day or 2.</p><p>If you have symptoms of a more serious problem, such as HACE or HAPE, try to get help right away and move to a lower altitude <strong>immediately</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2352894\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have severe symptoms after traveling or climbing to a high altitude, get medical care right away. Waiting to get treatment could cause serious health problems, or even death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2352909\"><span class=\"h1\">How is altitude sickness treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on which type of altitude sickness you have. If you have symptoms of acute mountain sickness, rest and stay where you are until you feel better. If your symptoms get worse, move to a lower altitude. For a headache, you can take medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</p><p>There are also prescription medicines that can help treat the symptoms of acute mountain sickness. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Acetazolamide</a> (brand name: Diamox) &ndash; This medicine can help prevent and treat acute mountain sickness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Dexamethasone</a> (brand name: Decadron) &ndash; This medicine can help keep the symptoms of acute mountain sickness from getting worse and it can help prevent swelling of the brain.</p><p/><p>The most important treatment for HACE (swelling of the brain) or HAPE (fluid in the lungs) is to get to a lower altitude right away. If you have HACE or HAPE and cannot get to a lower altitude, you might be put inside a special inflatable bag called a &quot;portable hyperbaric chamber&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F54655\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54655 \">picture 1</a>). Once you are zipped inside this bag, a doctor or nurse will fill it up with air that is similar to the air at lower altitudes. A doctor or nurse might also give you oxygen to breathe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2352924\"><span class=\"h1\">Can altitude sickness be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The best way to prevent altitude sickness is to avoid moving quickly to a higher altitude. Going slowly gives your body time to adjust.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are traveling to a very high altitude, plan to stretch your trip out over several days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are hiking or climbing, don't do difficult physical activities for the first few days, and avoid alcohol and sleeping pills.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When hiking, go to a higher altitude during the day and then go back down to a slightly lower altitude each night to sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have had altitude sickness before, your doctor might give you a medicine to keep you from getting it again.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2352939\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothermia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypothermia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-illness-including-mountain-sickness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High altitude illness (including mountain sickness) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
