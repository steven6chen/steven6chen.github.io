(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pheochromocytoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paragangliomas: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Neuroblastomas, which account for 97 percent of all neuroblastic tumors, are clinically heterogeneous, varying in location, histopathologic appearance, and biologic characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They are most remarkable for their broad spectrum of clinical behavior, which can range from spontaneous regression, to maturation to a benign ganglioneuroma, or aggressive disease with metastatic dissemination leading to death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Clinical diversity correlates closely with numerous clinical and biological factors, although its molecular basis remains largely unknown. For example, most infants with disseminated disease have a favorable outcome after treatment with chemotherapy and surgery, while the majority of children over the age of 18 months who have advanced neuroblastoma die from progressive disease despite intensive multimodality therapy.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of neuroblastoma will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of neuroblastoma are presented separately, as is a discussion of neuroblastomas arising in the olfactory epithelium.

Certain factors influence the biologic behavior of these tumors and are helpful in predicting outcome; some are patient-related (eg, age at the time of diagnosis), while the majority are tumor-related (disease stage, tumor histology, molecular and cytogenetic features).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor stage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of metastatic spread at presentation is the most important factor in determining outcome for patients with neuroblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Although regional spread to lymph nodes attached or adjacent to the primary tumor does not significantly affect outcome, distant metastatic disease (eg, bone marrow involvement) confers a much worse prognosis.</p><p>In the past, pediatric cooperative groups used different staging systems, which made it difficult to compare treatments and outcomes. In the early 1990s, a uniform staging system, the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS), was adopted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73974 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Tumor stage in this system is defined according to resectability and spread to lymph nodes or distant sites. Disease stage at diagnosis is to some extent influenced by age; a greater proportion of patients diagnosed after one year of age have stage 3 or 4 disease compared to those who present earlier (80 versus 41 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>In 2009, the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) proposed revisions to the staging system, incorporating pretreatment imaging parameters rather than findings at resection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F88604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88604 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. Preliminary studies of the INRG staging system (INRGSS) suggest that it may offer improved insights into which patients require intensive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. All international cooperative groups, including the Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group, are validating and have incorporated this staging system into their prospective research.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage 4S disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stage 4S neuroblastoma is a special category that is reserved for infants below one year of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73974 \">table 1</a>) who have resectable primary tumors (stage 1 or 2) and metastases that are limited to the liver, skin, and bone marrow; infants with metastases to cortical bone are excluded from this category. The INRGSS has modified the definition of 4S (called Ms) to include patients up to 18 months of age and those with regional spread of primary tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F88604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88604 \">table 2</a>). The prognostic influence of younger age at diagnosis is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Age at diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The 4S (or Ms) category is an exception to the typically dismal prognosis for children with widespread metastases from neuroblastoma. Overall survival (OS) for infants in this category is over 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One contributing factor is that the tumor cells in infants with stage 4S disease have the capacity to undergo spontaneous regression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, like all stages of neuroblastomas, the tumors that make up stage 4S disease are heterogeneous, and they require heterogeneous treatment protocols (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Low-risk disease'</a> below)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520711824\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage 4N disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the prognostic significance of metastatic spread to specific sites has not been extensively studied, accumulating data suggest that patients with metastases confined to distant lymph nodes (4N or IV-N disease) have a better prognosis than do others with metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective series derived from the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Database, 146 of 2250 patients with stage 4 disease had tumor limited to distant lymph nodes (6.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In contrast to patients with non-node stage 4 disease, patients with 4N disease had significantly better five-year event-free survival (EFS, 77 versus 35 percent) and overall survival (85 versus 42 percent). 4N patients were more likely to be younger and have tumors with favorable characteristics, including absence of <em>MYCN</em> amplification (89 versus 69 percent, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Given the retrospective nature of these data and the fact that patients were included who had not been treated with modern high-risk regimens, patients with 4N disease should not yet be separately classified from others with stage 4 disease or treated differently. This category of patients is not defined separately in the INRG staging classification.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Age at diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age at presentation is an important prognostic factor in children with neuroblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/12,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16-18</a>]. In general, the younger the age at diagnosis, the better the survival rate (with the exception of newborns, see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Five-year survival rates for neuroblastoma derived from data of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute are 83, 55, and 40 percent for children younger than one year, one to four years, and five to nine years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Even favorable or less aggressive-appearing neuroblastomas fare worse as children get older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic risk classification'</a> below.)</p><p>The significantly better outcome of disseminated disease in children under the age of one compared to other age groups is reflected in the special 4S category of disease stage, which applies only to infants. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Stage 4S disease'</a> above.)</p><p>An age of 18 months appears to be appropriate for risk group stratification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and this age has been incorporated into the current treatment regimens as well as the proposed INRGSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'High-risk disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Newborns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates (younger than four to six weeks) who have stage 4S neuroblastoma are an exception to the general rule that younger age is associated with better outcome. Among this small subset of patients, neuroblastoma in the liver can grow rapidly, resulting in pulmonary compromise and renal failure in approximately 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/9,11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,18</a>]. Such infants must be monitored closely even after treatment initiation. In contrast, newborns who have limited adrenal disease (typically diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound) have a favorable prognosis and frequently do not need treatment. (See <a href=\"#H433137774\" class=\"local\">'Infants with small adrenal masses'</a> below.).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic risk classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologically, the balance between neural-type cells and Schwann-type (Schwannian) cells helps to categorize the tumor as neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, or ganglioneuroma. In turn, neuroblastomas can have varying degrees of differentiation (undifferentiated, poorly differentiated, or differentiating). These histologic subtypes are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-neuroblastoma#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathology of neuroblastoma&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p>Histology, in addition to age, is important prognostically. In 1984, Shimada et al derived a pathologic risk classification scheme that relates the histopathologic features of the tumor, other biologic variables, and patient age to clinical behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Tumors are classified as favorable or unfavorable based upon the degree of neuroblast differentiation, Schwannian stroma content, the frequency of cell division (the mitosis-karyorrhexis index [MKI]), and age at diagnosis.</p><p>The International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC) system, a modification of the Shimada system, was established in 1999 and its prognostic value subsequently confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. In one validation study, five-year EFS was more than three times greater among children with favorable histology tumors compared with unfavorable histology tumors (90 versus 27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytogenetics and molecular genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although no pathognomonic genetic or chromosomal alteration has been identified in neuroblastomas, certain molecular and cytogenetic characteristics correlate with prognosis, including <em>MYCN</em> (<em>N-myc</em>) amplification, DNA content (ploidy), and gain or loss of whole or partial chromosomes. The importance of <em>MYCN</em> amplifications, ploidy, and segmental chromosomal aberrations are reflected in their inclusion as prognostic factors in determining risk assignment for treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-neuroblastoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathology of neuroblastoma&quot;, section on 'Molecular/genetic abnormalities and implications for prognosis'</a> and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The modern treatment of neuroblastoma is determined based on risk categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68159\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68159 \">table 3</a>).

In general, tumor outcomes for children with low-risk neuroblastoma are excellent. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for low risk tumors although some infants and children need additional chemotherapy and others can be observed without surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H433137982\"><span class=\"h3\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expectant observation is a reasonable alternative in some newborns with small adrenal masses and some infants with localized neuroblastoma or asymptomatic stage 4S disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H433137774\"><span class=\"h4\">Infants with small adrenal masses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborns who have small adrenal masses detected by prenatal ultrasound represent a favorable cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Surgery alone is curative, although it can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Observational studies suggest that expectant observation is a safe alternative to surgery in newborns with localized neuroblastoma, and that many of these tumors spontaneously regress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/29-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-37</a>]. </p><p>In a Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group prospective study of 87 infants younger than six months with small adrenal masses (diameter up to 3.1 cm for solid masses and 5.0 cm for cystic masses), 83 of whom elected observation, spontaneous reduction in tumor volume was noted in two thirds of patients, including 27 patients with no residual mass by the end of follow up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Surgery was avoided in 81 percent of patients with a median follow up of 3.2 years, and 3-year overall survival was 100 percent. Among 20 patients who underwent resection, the majority had confirmed stage I disease. A diagnosis other than neuroblastoma was observed in seven patients at the time of surgery; alternative diagnoses included extralobar pulmonary sequestration, adrenal cortical neoplasm, and hematoma. </p><p>Patients should be referred for surgery if there is evidence of progressive tumor enlargement during the period of observation. Chemotherapy is not indicated unless disease progresses and surgical resection cannot be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H974579\"><span class=\"h4\">Localized neuroblastoma in children less than one year</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A strategy of initial observation has been applied to children less than one year of age with localized, pathologically proven neuroblastoma (International Neuroblastoma Staging System [INSS] stage 1, 2, or 3) without <em>MYCN</em> amplification. In a prospective, nonrandomized multicenter study, 93 of 340 children (27 percent) were observed without either primary resection of gross residual tumor or chemotherapy following the initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At a median follow-up of 58 months, spontaneous remissions were observed in 44 cases (including 17 complete), while 35 had evidence of local progression or stage 4s, four had progression to stage 4, and 10 had no change in tumor size.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy were used to salvage those children who had evidence of progression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor regression was often delayed, with median times to first evidence and complete regression of 3.3 and 10 months, respectively.

Although survival is excellent with minimal or no therapy, observation is not appropriate for all 4S patients. Subsets of patients with 4S disease and a poor prognosis include infants less than two months old, diploid tumor or undifferentiated tumor, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <em>MYCN</em> amplification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

All 44 infants who received supportive care alone were alive at five years, compared to 81 percent of those who required cytotoxic therapy for symptoms. Five of the six deaths were in infants younger than two months of age and were due to extensive hepatomegaly, suggesting that aggressive initial therapy should be considered in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery alone is the primary treatment for low-risk tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>]. Resectability is determined by tumor location and mobility, relationship to major nerves and blood vessels, the presence of distant metastases, and patient age. Sacrifice of vital organs to achieve a complete resection of large primary tumors at the time of diagnosis should be avoided, particularly in infants who have a favorable prognosis. Surgery should be delayed in circumstances when less than 50 percent of the tumor can be safely removed and neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be administered to reduce the size of the tumor prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Two- to five-year EFS rates with surgery alone are greater than 93 percent for children with stage 1 disease; because recurrences can be successfully managed with further surgery or chemotherapy, five-year survival rates are 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/39,40,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40,44-46</a>].</p><p>For most children with stage 2A or 2B disease and no symptoms, the outlook after surgery alone is also excellent. Chemotherapy was a component of early treatment regimens but has gradually been removed over successive clinical trials without detriment to patients outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/39-41,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41,44,45</a>]. This was illustrated by a Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group clinical trial for low-risk neuroblastoma that included 306 asymptomatic, stage 2A and 2B infants and children who underwent surgical resection and then close follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Five-year overall survival was similar in patients with stage 2A disease compared with 2B disease (98 versus 96 percent), despite a significantly lower EFS in patients with stage 2B disease (85 versus 92 percent). Patient age and tumor characteristics such as DNA content and histology were important prognostic factors in these patients that contributed to the lower EFS in patients with stage 2B disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with low-risk disease, multi-agent low or moderate intensity chemotherapy is reserved for those whose tumors cannot be resected or who have threatening symptoms of spinal cord compression or respiratory or bowel compromise.

Results from randomized trials have consistently demonstrated improved progression-free survival in patients who received myeloablative chemotherapy with stem cell rescue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>], and some of these studies demonstrated an improvement in overall survival in certain groups of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. A Cochrane review of three randomized trials comparing high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell rescue versus conventional therapy in 739 children with high-risk neuroblastoma (utilizing a cutoff of &gt;12 rather than &gt;18 months of age to define high risk) found that although high-dose chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival was not significantly better [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. There were also no differences in secondary malignant disease and treatment-related death between the two treatment groups, while one of the trials showed a significantly higher rate of renal effects, interstitial pneumonitis, and veno-occlusive disease in the myeloablative group. One potential reason for the inability to detect a survival impact may have been the use of a 12-month rather than an 18-month cutoff for high-risk disease in all three trials, which would have resulted in intermediate-risk patients being classified as high risk. An additional confounding factor is that patients who relapse after receiving myeloablative chemotherapy and stem cell rescue have limited treatment options compared to control patients who can receive this type of therapy at relapse.</p><p>Despite aggressive multimodality therapy, current survival rates remain unacceptably low (approximately 40 percent), and the improved outcomes have come at a cost of significant early and late toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2054801221\"><span class=\"h3\">Components of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following briefly summarizes the components of modern therapy for high-risk disease; specific treatment details are beyond the scope of this review:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Induction</strong> &ndash; In the induction phase, intensive chemotherapy with a combination of agents (eg, platinum agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>) is used to shrink primary and metastatic tumors; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teniposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teniposide</a> may be used outside of the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Local control &ndash;</strong> Local control of the primary tumor is achieved with surgical resection and radiation therapy. The importance of achieving a gross total resection of the primary tumor in patients with disseminated disease is controversial, with some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/17,60-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,60-64</a>] but not others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/50,65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,65,66</a>] suggesting a better outcome for complete resection. Surgical resection of the tumor should be performed by a pediatric surgeon with experience in resecting extensive, infiltrating tumors. Resection may be performed after several courses of induction chemotherapy, when the tumor is smaller and less invasive. Radiotherapy dosed to the primary tumor bed and other sites of bulky disease may be beneficial in preventing local tumor recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. Whether completeness of resection impacts outcome may be related to the concurrent use and dosage of radiotherapy delivered to the primary tumor bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Consolidation</strong> &ndash; After tumor bulk has been decreased by chemotherapy and surgery, the consolidation phase includes higher-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. The fact that the majority of high-risk patients have bone marrow metastases at the time of diagnosis would appear to compromise the use of autologous marrow for reconstitution, and early clinical trials utilized immunomagnetic &ldquo;purging&rdquo; of stem cell products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

The role of IL-2 is being further addressed in an ongoing European trial.</p><p/><p>Despite intensive multimodality therapy, only approximately 40 percent of children remain disease-free long-term, and the most common outcome of high-risk neuroblastoma is recurrence of disease followed by death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Improving survival in this group of children is a priority in international cooperative groups.</p><p>Maximizing the intensity of therapy with stem cell rescue and identifying the best chemotherapy combinations are two directions of research.

In a phase III trial of approximately 600 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma that had responded to a multidrug induction regimen, those randomly assigned to busulphan and melphalan had an improved three-year event-free survival (50 versus 38 percent) and five-year overall survival (54 versus 41 percent) relative to those receiving CEM, differences that were statistically significant. Severe life-threatening toxicities occurred in 4 percent of patients receiving busulfan and melphalan versus 10 percent receiving CEM. However, this regimen has not been studied within the context of alternative induction or postconsolidation regimens similar to those used in North America.</p><p>Preliminary evidence suggests that tandem transplants may result in improved disease outcomes relative to single transplants. In a multicenter study, 355 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma were randomly assigned after induction therapy to either single transplant with carboplatin-etoposide-melphalan (CEM) or tandem transplant with thiotepa-cyclophosphamide, followed by a modified CEM (TC:CEM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-neuroblastoma/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. High-risk disease was defined as a tumor with amplification of the <em>MYCN</em> oncogene occurring in children of any age or as metastatic disease occurring in children who were older than 18 months at diagnosis. While the tandem transplant group experienced improved three-year event-free survival (EFS) compared with those receiving single transplants (61 versus 48 percent), the difference in overall survival at three years did not reach statistical significance (74 versus 69 percent). For the subset of patients receiving immunotherapy, tandem transplants were associated with improvements in both EFS (74 versus 56 percent) and overall survival (OS; 84 versus 76 percent); however, longer-term follow-up will be needed to confirm these results. Cumulative rates of severe mucosal, infectious, or liver toxicities and regimen-related mortality were similar between arms.

Neuroblastomas are remarkable for their highly variable natural history, which can range from spontaneous regression, to maturation to a benign ganglioneuroma, or aggressive disease with metastatic dissemination leading to death.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improvements in outcome for children with neuroblastoma have been the result of cooperative group, multicenter clinical trials, which have integrated combined modality approaches with an understanding of the prognostic factors affecting outcome. Patients should be managed in a setting where appropriate expertise in the treatment of neuroblastoma is available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Key factors influencing the clinical behavior of neuroblastomas include tumor stage, age at diagnosis, pathologic risk classification, cytogenetics, and molecular genetics. These factors have been combined to define low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, which are used to define treatment strategies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68159\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68159 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73974 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with low-risk disease, surgery is the primary treatment modality when complete resection is feasible, with several exceptions. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Low-risk disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with low-risk tumors that cannot be completely resected or which have life-threatening complications, chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy may be required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the subset of patients with asymptomatic 4S disease, observation may be an option, since there is a high rate of spontaneous regression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For infants younger than six months of age with small, localized adrenal masses, we recommend expectant observation with serial ultrasound and urine catecholamines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with intermediate-risk disease, a combined-modality approach that includes chemotherapy and surgical resection is standard. The degree of surgical resection and duration of chemotherapy required is under investigation. The role of radiation therapy is less clear, except in the context of disease progression despite chemotherapy plus surgery or for complications such as spinal cord compression. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Intermediate-risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with high-risk neuroblastoma, substantial improvements have been seen with aggressive combined modality approaches. These generally include chemotherapy, surgical resection, high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue, radiation therapy and <span class=\"nowrap\">biologic/immunologic</span> therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dinutuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dinutuximab</a>). These approaches have improved event free survival, but the majority of patients eventually relapse and die of their disease. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'High-risk disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Whenever possible, children with high-risk neuroblastoma should be enrolled in randomized controlled trials in order to validate and improve the long-term efficacy of the current treatment approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who have been treated for neuroblastoma are at risk for recurrence and for late complications of their treatment. Treating physicians should be aware of these potential issues. Long-term follow-up guidelines have been published by the Children's Oncology Group (available online at <a href=\"http://www.survivorshipguidelines.org/&amp;token=S16MTPPY6cpS0A68kxrRsQOkLnEIm8+QaMhQyNKCcl+JTIC9BC9aNpypysLPfb9F&amp;TOPIC_ID=5203\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.survivorshipguidelines.org</a>).
