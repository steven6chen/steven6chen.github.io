MRSA must be differentiated from other strains of <em>S. aureus</em> because special infection control precautions are recommended for patients with MRSA. The preferred methods for routine testing of <em>S. aureus</em> isolates for their susceptibility to beta-lactams are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Oxacillin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/salt</span> screening plates containing 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> oxacillin and 4 percent NaCl</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Broth microdilution tests with 2 percent sodium chloride</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agar dilution tests with 2 percent sodium chloride</p><p/><p>Disk diffusion susceptibility tests identify most MRSA, but they may not identify some heterogeneous class 1 or 2 strains. Present versions of systems such as Microscan, Vitek, BBL Crystal MRSA ID system, Alamar tests, and Rapid ATB Staph system appear to detect a majority of MRSA strains. However, occasional strains of methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus</em> may be misclassified as MRSA by the Vitek system when certain gram-positive susceptibility cards are used. Unlike typical health care-associated MRSA, such strains usually are susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clindamycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a>, and other non-beta-lactam antibiotics.</p><p>Commercially available molecular assays can rapidly identify MRSA from positive blood cultures with gram-positive cocci in clusters.

For most hospitals, analysis of antibiotic susceptibility patterns (antibiograms) of isolates represents the most practical initial approach to typing. Comparing the minimum inhibitory concentrations or inhibitory zone diameters of isolates, rather than qualitative results, results in better differentiation of strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>However, genotypic methods have superior discriminatory power and should be used whenever possible. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is an excellent method for typing MRSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Arbitrary-primed polymerase chain reaction typing methods also differentiate MRSA strains adequately in many situations and are more rapid and less labor intensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Rapid whole-genome sequencing is another method that may be helpful but is not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>No single typing method has been established to be ideal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A combination of typing methods is likely to give the most accurate information regarding the relatedness of MRSA isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF TRANSMISSION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">In the hospital</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) is most commonly transmitted on the hands of health care workers; as a result, good hand hygiene is considered an essential measure for reducing the spread of this pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The potential efficacy of hand hygiene was illustrated in a report in which a hospital-wide hand-hygiene program was implemented that emphasized bedside hand disinfection with an alcohol-based solution, as well as hand-washing with soap and water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Compliance with hand hygiene increased progressively from 48 to 66 percent over a three-year period. At the same time, there were significant reductions in the prevalence of overall hospital-acquired infection (16.9 to 9.9 percent) and in MRSA transmission rates (2.16 to 0.93 episodes per 10,000 patient-days).</p><p>Guidelines for the prevention of MRSA have been developed by the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; the Joint Working Party of the British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, Hospital Infection Society, and Infection Control Nurses Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; and the Society for Health care Epidemiology of America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>].</p><p>The recommendations of these guidelines should be followed when caring for patients with MRSA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the patient in a private room, or place two or more patients with MRSA in the same room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear clean, nonsterile gloves when entering the patient's room; remove the gloves when leaving the patient's room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash hands with an antimicrobial soap or waterless antiseptic agent (eg, alcohol hand rinse or gel) upon leaving the patient's room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a gown when entering the room if substantial contact with the patient or environmental surfaces in the room is anticipated, or if the patient has wound drainage not contained by a dressing. Remove the gown before leaving the patient's room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upon removing gloves and gown, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub. However, if hands are visibly contaminated with blood or other proteinaceous materials, wash hands with an antimicrobial soap and water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit transport of the patient from the room to essential purposes only.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When possible, dedicate the use of noncritical equipment to a single patient or cohort of patients. If use for another patient is unavoidable, adequately clean and disinfect the item before use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In selected circumstances, implement a program of active surveillance cultures to identify patients colonized or infected with MRSA. This strategy is somewhat controversial. Early detection of colonized patients may facilitate more timely institution of appropriate contact precautions (eg, use of gloves and gowns), which have been shown to possibly control the spread of MRSA more effectively than standard precautions. Surveillance cultures of the anterior nares and open wounds may be useful for patients at high risk of MRSA colonization or infection.</p><p/><p>A number of other measures appear to have been useful in limiting hospital spread of MRSA and should be considered for use by hospitals.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Line listing &ndash; Maintain a list (preferably computerized) of patients known to be positive for MRSA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify known cases on readmission &ndash; Develop a system for promptly identifying and isolating known MRSA carriers who are readmitted. Screen the patient to see if he or she is still colonized. The potential importance of this approach was demonstrated in a prospective study from France of MRSA colonization status in previously colonized patients readmitted to the same facility three or more months later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thirty-one of 78 such patients (40 percent) continued to be colonized with the organism (median time to clearing of 8.5 months).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevalence surveys of patients &ndash; Culture roommates of newly identified MRSA cases. Consider culturing other patients on the ward if a clustering of new MRSA cases occurs on a nursing unit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In intensive care units where MRSA is not already endemic, perform prevalence culture survey of all other patients in the unit whenever a single, new MRSA case is identified. Culture specimens should be obtained from the anterior nares and from any wounds that may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Consider culturing inguinal region if no wound is present. Use of a selective medium will reduce the workload for the microbiology laboratory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor compliance with control measures &ndash; Because many studies have shown that compliance with barrier precautions and hand washing often is suboptimal, hospitals with ongoing health care-associated transmission of MRSA should consider developing systems for monitoring compliance by health care workers and provide feedback to personnel regarding their performance.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">In the community</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Community-acquired infections frequently recur in individuals and commonly spread within families and among children in day care centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Persistent colonization may contribute to transmission in the community. In a multicenter prospective cohort study, approximately 20 percent of patients treated for MRSA skin and soft tissue infection remained colonized after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Wounds should be covered with clean, dry bandages; if the wound cannot be kept covered, patients should be excluded from day care, athletic practice, or other activities with close contact until the wound is healed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Eradication of carriage'</a> below.)</p><p>Isolation and barrier precautions for hospitalized patients with MRSA infection are discussed above. The question of whether to screen children admitted to the hospital or to special care units and isolate those who are CA-MRSA colonized without signs of infection remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].

However, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of such treatments. A systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical or systemic antimicrobial therapy to eradicate nasal or extranasal MRSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Mupirocin-resistant MRSA has been described in a patient who had received eight courses of mupirocin over a nine-month period; spread of this organism was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 12 additional patients and 11 staff members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a study from a single institution, 14.7 percent of <em>S. aureus</em> isolates from children with recurrent <em>S. aureus</em> infections were resistant to mupirocin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Because affected patients often carry MRSA on areas of intact skin, as well as in the anterior nares, some authorities favor bathing colonized patients with an antimicrobial soap (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorhexidine</a>) or dilute bleach water baths. This procedure seems reasonable, but how much it contributes to control of MRSA is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Instituting bleach baths is a reasonable component of a prevention strategy for children with recurrent skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). In an open-label trial, 300 patients with community-associated SSTI and <em>S. aureus</em> colonization of the nares, axilla, or inguinal folds were randomly assigned to one of four groups: no treatment; twice daily intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mupirocin</a> ointment for five days; twice daily intranasal mupirocin plus daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorhexidine</a> body washes for five days; or twice daily intranasal mupirocin plus daily 15-minute dilute bleach water soaks (one-fourth cup of bleach per tub of water) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. All groups received education about personal and household hygiene. Decolonization with mupirocin alone or in combination with chlorhexidine or bleach baths was more effective than education alone at eradicating colonization at one month (56, 55, and 63 versus 38 percent, respectively). However, at four months, the only regimen more effective than education alone in eradicating colonization was mupirocin plus bleach baths (71 versus 48 percent). Recurrent SSTI was common, occurring in 20 percent of participants at one month and 36 percent of participants at four months, suggesting that factors other than endogenous colonization play a role in MRSA infection. In another randomized trial, medically attended recurrence of SSTI occurred in 17 percent of children who received bleach baths twice per week for three months in addition to hygienic measures and 21 percent of children who received hygienic measures alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-prevention-and-control/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].
