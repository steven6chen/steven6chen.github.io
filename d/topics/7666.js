The need for insulin depends upon the balance between insulin secretion and insulin resistance. All patients with type 1 diabetes need insulin treatment permanently, unless they receive an islet or whole organ pancreas transplant; many patients with type 2 diabetes will require insulin as their beta-cell function declines over time.</p><p>Indications for insulin therapy, available formulations of insulin, insulin pharmacokinetics, and determinants of efficacy will be reviewed here. The specifics of insulin therapy for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and intensive insulin therapy for critically ill patients who become hyperglycemic are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and intensive insulin therapy in critical illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHICH PATIENTS NEED INSULIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin must be given to all patients with type 1 diabetes, which is due to autoimmune islet-cell injury that eventually leads to virtually complete insulin deficiency. Ideally, physiologic replacement of insulin, imitating the secretory pattern of the nondiabetic pancreas but keeping in mind that therapeutic insulin is administered subcutaneously, is desirable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The peak incidence of type 1 diabetes is around the time of puberty, but approximately 25 percent of cases present after 35 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Insulin is also indicated for patients with secondary diabetes due to pancreatic insufficiency, as well as in many patients with type 2 diabetes to manage hyperglycemia.</p><p>Clinical features that, if present in a patient with diabetes at any age, suggest the need for insulin therapy include marked and otherwise unexplained recent weight loss (irrespective of the initial weight), a short history with severe symptoms, and the presence of moderate to heavy ketonuria. Diabetic ketoacidosis at first presentation usually indicates that the patient has type 1 diabetes and will require lifelong insulin treatment. However, some patients with type 2 diabetes, especially in the Afro-Caribbean populations (so-called &quot;Flatbush diabetes&quot;), may present with ketoacidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diabetes mellitus and genetic diabetic syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes of ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A more difficult question is when to use insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. This disorder is characterized by both insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Therapy should begin with diet, weight reduction, and exercise, which can frequently induce normoglycemia if compliance is optimal. Patients with persistent hyperglycemia are often started on one or more oral hypoglycemic drugs. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> is a good early choice, based on its safety profile, neutral effect with regard to weight gain, and ability to lower glycemia. Insulin is added if goal glycemic control is not attained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Initiation of insulin therapy, however, is often unnecessarily delayed, owing to clinician or patient reluctance and other factors, thus exposing patients to the physiologic consequences of prolonged hyperglycemia. Patients' preconceptions about the use of insulin need to be addressed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52039\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52039 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients should be made aware that initiating insulin does not represent a personal &quot;failure&quot; and that most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require exogenous insulin, due to decline in endogenous insulin production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INSULIN PREPARATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients use either biosynthetic human insulin (eg, neutral protamine hagedorn [NPH], regular) or a synthetic insulin analog (eg, glargine, lispro). Animal-sourced insulins (derived from the pancreas of cows and pigs) are no longer produced in the United States but are available on a limited basis in some countries (eg, United Kingdom) for rare patients who cannot manage their diabetes with biosynthetic insulin. Compared with human insulin, porcine insulin differs by one amino acid and bovine by three amino acids, and the generation of antibodies to these animal insulins may change their pharmacokinetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Human versus analogs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The time to peak and the duration of action of human insulin preparations (NPH and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a>) do not replicate endogenous basal and postprandial insulin secretion. Thus, insulin analogs (lispro, aspart, glulisine, glargine, detemir, degludec) were developed. The very rapid-acting insulin analogs have both faster and shorter duration of action than regular insulin for premeal coverage, while the long-acting analogs have a longer and flatter profile than NPH for basal coverage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67242\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67242 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>To produce an insulin preparation with a faster onset and shorter duration of action than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a>, modifications were made in the insulin molecule to prevent it from forming hexamers or polymers that slow absorption and delay action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-aspart-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin aspart</a> is identical to human regular insulin except for a substitution of aspartic acid for proline at position B28. This substitution results in a reduction in hexamer formation and, consequently, more rapid absorption, faster onset of action, and shorter duration of action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These rapid-acting insulin analogs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-lispro-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin lispro</a>, aspart, and glulisine) have an onset of action within 5 to 15 minutes, peak action at 45 to 75 minutes, and a duration of action of two to four hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73676 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>].</p><p>Different alterations result in the slower absorption and longer duration of action of other insulin analogs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutral protamine lispro (NPL, also called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-lispro-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin lispro</a> protamine suspension) is a protamine-based suspension (like NPH) of the short-acting analog insulin lispro. It has an activity profile very similar to that of NPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although it is only available in the United States in a premixed combination with insulin lispro, in other countries it is available as a separate insulin analog for basal coverage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Insulin glargine</a> is identical to human insulin except for a substitution of glycine for asparagine in position A21 and by the addition of two arginine molecules in the B-chain of the insulin molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These modifications result in a change in the pH such that, after subcutaneous administration, glargine precipitates in the tissue, forming hexamers, which delays absorption and prolongs duration of action. Glargine has no appreciable peak and a duration of action that usually lasts 24 hours. Glargine cannot be mixed with rapid-acting insulins as the kinetics of both the glargine and rapid-acting insulin will be altered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-detemir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Insulin detemir</a> is an acylated insulin; the fatty acid side chain allows albumin binding and results in prolongation of action. It is considerably less potent than human insulin and, therefore, it is formulated using a 4:1 molar ratio (ie, one detemir unit contains four times as many insulin detemir molecules as one unit of any other insulin). Compared with glargine, it does have a noticeable peak and rarely lasts 24 hours. Clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes have suggested that twice-per-day injections may be necessary to achieve acceptable basal rate coverage and optimal glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In type 2 diabetes, where endogenous insulin secretion may mask any deficiencies in basal insulin, the data are less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, in our clinical experience, detemir also often requires twice-daily administration in patients with type 2 diabetes. Detemir cannot be mixed with rapid-acting insulins as the kinetics of both the detemir and rapid-acting insulin will be altered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-degludec-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Insulin degludec</a> is almost identical to human insulin, except for deletion of the last amino acid from the B-chain and the addition of a glutamyl link from LysB29 to a hexadecanedioic fatty acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This feature allows it to form soluble multihexamers at the injection site, from which monomers slowly separate and are absorbed. This property confers a long duration of action (&gt;40 hours) and reduces variability in plasma concentration with once daily dosing. In contrast to glargine and detemir insulins, degludec may be mixed with rapid-acting insulins without altering the kinetics of the degludec or the rapid-acting insulin.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With respect to short-term outcomes, such as glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and risk of hypoglycemia, the newer rapid-acting insulins may have a minor glycemic advantage over short-acting (regular) insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes but not in patients with type 2 diabetes. The long-acting insulins, glargine and detemir, may have some modest clinical advantages over NPH (less symptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia) in type 2 diabetes, with the important disadvantage of higher cost. In type 1 diabetes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> may have a slight glycemic advantage and detemir less risk of severe hypoglycemia compared with NPH. The trials examining these issues are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Multiple daily injections'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H4142283563\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Choice of insulin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is theoretical concern that changes in the structure of the insulin molecule (as occurs with the synthesis of insulin analogs) may inadvertently change other properties of insulin. As an example, glargine and detemir have different affinities (glargine higher, detemir lower) than human insulin for the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor, which theoretically could alter mitogenic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An increase in mitogenic activity could increase the risk of some known diabetes complications, such as retinopathy, and could theoretically increase neoplastic transformation.</p><p>There are few studies comparing insulin analogs and human insulin with respect to long-term outcomes, such as diabetic complications or mortality. In a retrospective review of four multinational trials of glargine versus NPH, more patients randomly assigned to glargine had an increase in three steps or more on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, the results from a randomized trial are more reassuring. In a five-year trial in over 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes previously treated with oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin, or both, there was no evidence of a greater risk of retinopathy progression (defined as three ETDRS steps or more) in patients randomly assigned to twice daily NPH versus once daily glargine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Data regarding use of insulin analogs and risk of cancer are conflicting with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-26</a>]. Some retrospective population-based studies evaluating the risk of malignant neoplasms in patients with diabetes treated with human insulin or insulin analogs have raised a concern about a possible association between treatment with insulin glargine and an increased risk of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. However, these studies have not consistently demonstrated increased risk. Moreover, those that have been positive do not prove causality and have several limitations, including a small number of cancer cases and important differences in the patient characteristics of those taking glargine alone versus other types of insulin, which may explain the increased risk.</p><p>In a subsequent analysis of the manufacturer's pharmacovigilance database for all randomized, clinical trials (10,880 patients) comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> with any comparator in type 1 or type 2 diabetes, there was no difference in the reported cases of malignancy between the insulin glargine and comparator groups (0.8 versus 0.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a randomized trial comparing the addition of insulin glargine (to normalize fasting blood glucose) to standard care (only 11 percent treated with insulin) in patients with cardiovascular disease and either type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, there was no increase in cancer risk after 6.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Until more data are available, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation against glargine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Insulin choices should continue to be individualized.

Intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) also provides some peak coverage for breakfast and lunch intake, although not as physiologic as replacement with faster-acting insulin given at mealtimes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Basal insulin levels can also be achieved by continuous infusion of a short- or rapid-acting insulin via an insulin pump, used almost exclusively in type 1 diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bolus</strong> &ndash; Short-acting (regular) or rapid-acting (lispro, aspart, or glulisine) insulin are typically provided as a premeal bolus to cover the extra requirements after food is absorbed.</p><p/><p>The approximate time of onset, peak activity, and duration of action of the most commonly used insulins are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73676 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The term &quot;conventional insulin therapy&quot; has been used to describe simpler insulin regimens, such as single daily injections, or two injections per day of regular and NPH insulin, mixed together in the same syringe and given in fixed amounts before breakfast and dinner. The term &quot;intensive insulin therapy&quot; is used to describe more complex regimens that separate basal insulin delivery (given as one to two daily injections of intermediate- or long-acting insulin) with superimposed doses of short-acting or rapid-acting insulins three or more times daily. While intensive regimens were initially used for patients with type 1 diabetes, they are now frequently used for patients with type 2 diabetes, as well. Conventional insulin therapy is unlikely to achieve target A1C levels in patients with type 1 diabetes and may provide suboptimal glycemic control for patients with type 2 diabetes as beta-cell function declines.</p><p>Both glucose and insulin metabolism are altered in patients who have chronic renal failure. The changes in the insulin regimen that must be made in these patients are discussed separately.

In several reports, U-500 insulin has been used successfully in patients with obesity, immune-mediated insulin resistance, and genetic abnormalities of the insulin receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Because the high concentration of insulin delays absorption, the pharmacologic profile of U-500 regular insulin is most similar to that of NPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In one observational study of 11 obese, severely insulin-resistant, uncontrolled diabetic patients (requiring &gt;200 units of insulin daily), substituting U-500 regular insulin for U-100 NPH insulin improved diabetes control (mean A1C decrease from 9.9 to 7.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. For patients who require over 300 units of insulin daily, the typical starting dose of U-500 regular insulin is 100 units twice daily. Dose adjustments are made using the same approach as for adjusting NPH insulin doses, eg approximately every two weeks, or more frequently if indicated, based on fasting and pre-dinner blood sugar measurements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H8877918\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Designing an insulin regimen'</a>.)</p><p>Although in the past U-500 insulin was dispensed using Tuberculin or U-100 syringes (which required dose conversions to deliver the correct dose), a dedicated U-500 insulin syringe is now available (as of November 2016). U-500 insulin should be dispensed with the U-500 insulin syringe as it should be less confusing for patients and ultimately safer to use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The syringe contains scale markings from 25 to 250 units in 5 unit increments (total volume 0.5 mL). Prescribers who order U-500 insulin should also prescribe U-500 syringes to avoid medication errors. The insulin dose should be expressed in units, rather than in volumetric terms as was the convention with the Tuberculin or U-100 syringes. Patients previously using a Tuberculin or U-100 syringe should be instructed on how to correctly draw the prescribed dose of U-500 insulin into the U-500 syringe. The U-500 syringe should only be used with U-500 insulin.</p><p>U-500 insulin is also available in a pen device, which is easy to use and provides accurate dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The pen dosing window shows the number of units of U-500 to be injected (with no need for dose conversion), and the pen delivers the volume that corresponds to the selected dose.

With the Tuberculin syringe, every 0.1 mL would equal 50 units of insulin.

The prefilled pen contains 450 units and allows for delivery of the same number of insulin units as glargine but in a smaller volume. However, on a unit-to-unit basis, U-300 glargine has a lower glucose-lowering effect than glargine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

However, there are problems with mixing different insulin preparations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When drawing up both insulin preparations in the same syringe, serum insulin concentrations tend to approach a single peak.

In 2014, another formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-insulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inhaled insulin</a> (Afrezza) received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Studies have shown that inhaled insulin causes a very rapid rise in serum insulin concentration (similar to that after subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-lispro-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin lispro</a> and aspart and faster than that after subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a>). However, due to its inefficient absorption, higher doses of insulin must be administered to achieve a therapeutic response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhaled insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINANTS OF INSULIN EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective use of insulin requires an understanding of the major variables that affect the degree of glycemic control. These include the insulin preparation, the size of the subcutaneous depot, injection technique, the site of injection, and subcutaneous blood flow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Type of insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The time of onset, peak activity, and duration of action of subcutaneous insulin preparations can only be approximated since the usually quoted data are based upon the administration of small amounts of insulin to a few normal subjects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73676 \">table 2</a>). Furthermore, the degree of absorption of any dose, both among patients and in the same patient, can vary from day to day by as much as 25 to 50 percent, leading to unexplained fluctuations in glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. This effect is greatest with longer-acting insulins and least with regular, lispro, aspart, and glulisine insulin. Thus, a dose of NPH insulin given before the evening meal may be sufficient to last through the night in one patient but may dissipate in another, resulting in fasting hyperglycemia. Part of the day-to-day variability in the absorption of NPH insulin may be due to incomplete mixing of the suspensions of insulin and protamine or zinc.</p><p>The absorption of long-acting insulin analogs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> also seems to vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In addition, there is some suggestion that the duration of action of detemir increases with higher doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Size of subcutaneous depot</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The variability in absorption is increased and net absorption is reduced with increasing size of the subcutaneous depot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This can become a limiting factor in patients who are insulin resistant and require large doses given several times per day. Conversely, one of the reasons why continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions may serve to smooth blood glucose control is that only regular or rapid-acting insulin is used and the size of the subcutaneous depot is very small (since the reservoir is held in a syringe or other chamber, outside the body) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Another approach to reduce the size of the subcutaneous depot and thereby increase insulin absorption is to use high pressure jet injectors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. These devices lead to a more rapid fall in blood glucose concentrations and a shorter duration of insulin action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], although there is no evidence that the variability in insulin absorption is improved. Jet injectors may also cause less pain than traditional needles and syringes. However, they are expensive, difficult to maintain, and are not recommended for routine use.</p><p>A variety of pen injectors, used with prefilled cartridges, are now available and are more convenient than conventional syringes and bottles but are more expensive. When small doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> (less than five units) are being given, the error in measuring the dose is almost 50 percent less when using pen injectors than with conventional insulin syringes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Injection technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injection technique is the same with insulin syringes and with pen injectors. Both the angle of needle entry and the depth of penetration affect the rate of insulin absorption. Very shallow insertion can cause a painful intradermal injection that is not well absorbed. In comparison, a perpendicular injection in a lean area may result in an intramuscular injection, from which absorption is more rapid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>Patients should be referred to a certified diabetes educator to be taught proper insulin injection technique. The recommended technique is to use an area of the body in which approximately 2.5 cm (one inch) of subcutaneous fat can be pinched between two fingers. The syringe, with a 0.5 inch microfine (27G) or ultrafine (29G) needle, is inserted perpendicular to the pinched skin up to the hilt and the insulin is then injected. The syringe barrel should not be pulled back before injection or the needle removed if blood is obtained. The needle should be held in place for several seconds before being withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This is especially important when using pen injectors, to avoid insulin leakage after withdrawal of the needle.</p><p>The common practice of cleaning the skin with an alcohol swab before injection may not be necessary. In a crossover study of 50 patients who received over 13,000 injections, there was no difference when the usual manner of injection was compared with injections through clothing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The only problem with the latter was an occasional blood stain on the clothing. Additional information on injection technique, mixing insulin, and syringe disposal is found elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Site of injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential sites for insulin injection are the upper arms, abdominal wall, upper legs, and buttocks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78710\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78710 \">figure 3</a>). A common cause of day-to-day variability in insulin action is the random rotation of injection sites from one region of the body to another. Insulin is absorbed fastest from the abdominal wall, slowest from the leg and buttock, and at an intermediate rate from the arm; at any of these sites, the rapidity of insulin absorption varies inversely with subcutaneous fat thickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/47,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,58</a>]. In a study using radiolabeled, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a>, the percent of the dose that disappeared at two hours was approximately 49 percent in the abdomen, 37 percent in the arm, and 26 percent in the leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The postprandial rise in plasma glucose concentration varied inversely with the rate of insulin absorption, being 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.7 to 2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> less after abdominal than after leg injection; the values after arm injection were intermediate between these responses.</p><p>These differences can be useful clinically. Premeal regular or rapid-acting insulin should be rapidly absorbed, and injection into the abdominal wall may therefore be preferable. On the other hand, slower absorption from the leg or buttock may be desirable with the pre-evening meal dose of intermediate-acting insulin to ensure a duration of action that lasts through the night.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Alterations in subcutaneous blood flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of insulin absorption is also determined by the rate of subcutaneous blood flow.
