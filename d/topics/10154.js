(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: General guidelines for recipient selection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Disease-based choice of procedure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-lung-transplant-rejection#H390634500\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of antibody-mediated lung transplant rejection&quot;, section on 'Laboratory'</a>.) </p><p>When donor lungs become available, the procuring organization contacts the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) national transplant communications center, UNet, by telephone or internet access. The UNet computer system runs <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/recipient</span> matches based on blood type, size of the organ, and distance between the donor and recipient and prioritizes recipients based on their severity of disease reflected by the lung allocation score. Once the recipient is identified, the organ procurement organization makes transportation arrangements and the transplant surgery is scheduled. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The recipient is prepared for surgery after matching with a donor lung, but induction of anesthesia is postponed until the donor lung has been inspected and approved by the retrieval team. If the donor lung is satisfactory, the recipient operation begins while the donor lung is in transit.

At most centers, a direct crossmatch is performed at the time of transplantation using fresh recipient serum and donor lymphocytes from peripheral blood or lymph node-derived cells.

The following is an overview for clinicians who are caring for lung transplant recipients, but is not intended to give specific instructions for the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Single lung transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Single lung transplantation (SLT), which accounts for approximately 25 percent of adult lung transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71574\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71574 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], extends the limited supply of donor organs to more patients, but provides less lung function as a buffer for late complications. The indications for single versus bilateral lung transplantation (BLT) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Disease-based choice of procedure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The patient is intubated with an endotracheal tube designed to facilitate one lung ventilation (OLV) during the procedure. Protective ventilation strategies are employed during OLV to minimize lung injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-isolation-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung isolation techniques&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A standard posterolateral or anterolateral thoracotomy incision is used for SLT. While ventilation is being given to the contralateral lung, the lung to be excised is deflated and mobilized. If persistent hypoxemia develops, the ipsilateral pulmonary artery is clamped to eliminate the shunt through the deflated, unventilated lung. Either refractory hypoxemia or hemodynamic instability at this stage would be an indication for extracorporeal mechanical circulatory support (eg, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or cardiopulmonary bypass), which is always on standby. (See <a href=\"#H3924973028\" class=\"local\">'Extracorporeal cardiorespiratory support'</a> below.)</p><p>While the dissection of the native lung is performed, the phrenic and vagus nerves must be safeguarded, and on the left side, the recurrent laryngeal nerve must be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins are sequentially ligated, after ensuring that the pulmonary artery pressure does not rise unacceptably in the remaining lung during tourniquet closure. If the PA pressure rise is excessive, cardiopulmonary support may be indicated for the remainder of the procedure. </p><p>If the right lung is being transplanted, the right main bronchus is divided immediately proximal to the right upper lobe orifice. If the left lung is being transplanted, the left main bronchus is divided just proximal to the secondary carina. The native lung is extracted and sent for culture and pathologic examination. </p><p>The donor lung is implanted, and the three anastomoses are performed in their posterior-to-anterior anatomic sequence: bronchus, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary veins-left atrium. The donor bronchus should be cut as short as possible (usually one ring from secondary carina) to prevent ischemic anastomotic complications.</p><p>When the vascular anastomoses have been completed, air is purged from the pulmonary circulation and the left atrium, and ventilation and perfusion are restored to the graft. An initial intravenous dose of 500 to 1000 mg of methylprednisone is administered intraoperatively at the time of reperfusion of the allograft(s). After completion of the anastomosis, two chest tubes are placed in the pleural space and the chest is closed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1160589629\"><span class=\"h2\">Bilateral lung transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BLT is performed in 97 percent of pediatric lung transplant cases and approximately 75 percent of adult cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71574\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71574 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The specific indications for BLT are generalized bronchiectasis, other chronic pulmonary infection, or pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, BLT is often performed in other lung transplant recipients to improve long-term outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Disease-based choice of procedure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As with SLT, the procedure begins with anesthesia and intubation designed to facilitate one lung ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-isolation-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung isolation techniques&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The standard approach is a bilateral sequential operation through a transverse thoracosternotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The lungs are implanted separately and sequentially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The incision provides excellent exposure of the pleural space, and the bronchial anastomoses are less prone to complications than the previous tracheal anastomosis. An alternative approach is via bilateral anterolateral incisions. </p><p>After the chest is opened, both native lungs are mobilized. The native lung with the worst function (assessed by <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> scan) is removed first, while one-lung ventilation is used on the contralateral lung. In about 50 to 60 percent of cases, extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support can be avoided by supporting the recipient with the contralateral lung. Problems with hypoxemia or hemodynamic instability are managed in the same manner described for SLT. In addition, protection of the vagus, phrenic, and left recurrent laryngeal nerves and sequential division of the main bronchus, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary veins are the same described above for SLT. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Single lung transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p>After the native lung is excised, implantation of the first allograft proceeds as for SLT. When the vascular anastomoses have been completed, air is purged from the pulmonary circulation and the left atrium, and ventilation and perfusion are restored to the graft. An initial intravenous dose of 500 to 1000 mg of methylprednisone is typically administered intraoperatively at the time of reperfusion of the allograft(s). </p><p>One-lung ventilation is then switched to the allograft, and the contralateral recipient pneumonectomy and donor lung implantation are performed. After completion of the anastomoses, two chest tubes are placed in each pleural space and the chest is closed. The upper and lower portions of the chest wall are approximated with pericostal sutures and the sternum is secured with wires. Instability and displacement of the sternum requiring surgical intervention are rare. The airway is inspected endoscopically, anesthesia is reversed, and the recipient is transferred to an intensive care unit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Living donor lobar transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lobar transplantation from living donors who are blood group and human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-donor specific antibody (DSA) compatible with the recipient has been performed for selected patients. In general, living lobar transplantation should be reserved for suitable candidates who, because of their clinical status, urgently need transplantation and, because of their place on the waiting list, seem unlikely to survive until a cadaveric donor becomes available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Nevertheless, this practice is rare in North America and Europe and is mostly used in Japan where there is a critical scarcity of cadaveric donors. </p><p>The ethical issues surrounding transplantation from living donors have been reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>], but the debate continues. Nonetheless, recipient outcomes have been satisfactory and donor morbidity has been minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8</a>]. In a series of 369 live donors, 18 percent experienced a serious complication, 6 percent needed early rehospitalization, and 2 percent underwent reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While objective measures of lung function suggest low donor morbidity, two subjective complaints were common in a series of 15 lobar donors: a decrease in exercise tolerance and insufficient acknowledgement of the donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>While the numbers are small, survival following living donor lobar (LDL) transplantation is similar to survival following cadaveric lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In a review of lung transplantation in Japan, the five year survival was comparable between 181 LDL recipients and 283 cadaveric recipients (71.6 and 72.3 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>When performing LDL, careful size matching is needed and sometimes, it is necessary to downsize the graft to achieve a good fit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography may help plan downsizing of donor lobes or use of a single lobe with contralateral pneumonectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. The technique for LDL transplantation is similar to that described for single and bilateral lung transplantation above. At the time of surgery, if the lobes are obtained from two donors, three surgical teams are required (one for each donor and one for the recipient). The ischemic time for the allograft is substantially less due to the ability to initiate recipient surgery during lobe retrieval from the donor and implant the allograft immediately upon retrieval. </p><p>One ongoing concern is that implanting lobes from two different donors makes human leukocyte antigen matching more complicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. On the other hand, it is possible that LDL recipients will experience less chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) as it may only affect one of the allografts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3155635734\"><span class=\"h2\">Cadaveric lobar transplants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cadaveric lobar transplants (CLT) can be a useful strategy to transplant rapidly deteriorating candidates on the wait list. It is most appropriate for the use in pediatric patients and small adults, usually those with pulmonary fibrosis. The largest experience in this area has been published by the Vienna group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3587397716\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart-lung transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart-lung transplantation is discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway complications after lung transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The preferred bronchial anastomotic technique has evolved over time and is currently an end-to-end anastomosis without omental wrap or bronchial artery revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The donor bronchus is transected no more than one or two cartilaginous rings above the lobar carina to reduce bronchial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The membranous portions of the donor and recipient bronchi are typically approximated and anastomosed using a running suture, while the cartilaginous layers are anastomosed with interrupted sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Alternatively, some centers use an end-to-end running technique with an absorbable suture. </p><p>Using current techniques, most centers report rates of airway anastomotic complications in the range of 7 to 18 percent. The management and prevention of airway complications are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway complications after lung transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Techniques that are no longer used include an end-to-end bronchial anastomosis with an omental wrap (omentopexy), a telescoping anastomosis with the cartilaginous portions of the donor and recipient bronchi intussuscepted, and end-to-end anastomosis with bronchial artery revascularization, using microsurgical techniques. Revascularization is anatomically and technically feasible, but the donor bronchial arteries must be salvaged when the lungs are harvested. Revascularization is accomplished by anastomosis of the donor bronchial artery to the recipient internal thoracic (mammary) artery. This technique has been successfully employed in single and bilateral lung transplantation, but it adds time and complexity to the operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. While revascularization has theoretical appeal, its benefits are uncertain, and it has not been widely employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3569367910\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In pediatric recipients and in recipients with pulmonary vascular disease, either CPB or ECMO is obligatory, but in adult patients without known pulmonary vascular disease, the need for extracorporeal cardiorespiratory support is more difficult to predict [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Among 170 patients who required ECMO support for lung transplantation, approximately 44 percent had an unanticipated need that developed intraoperatively and 56 percent were determined preoperatively to require ECMO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Preoperatively anticipated indications for ECMO include patients already requiring ECMO and those with idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension and other indications for transplant known to be associated with severe pulmonary hypertension (eg, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease), intraoperative hypoxemia, or significant hypercapnia. Preoperative risk factors for unanticipated need for ECMO include pulmonary fibrosis, secondary pulmonary hypertension (Group 3), and a dilated or hypertrophied right ventricle. Patients on mechanical ventilation prior to transplant are more likely to need extracorporeal support. Survival is similar among those who undergo lung transplantation with or without ECMO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Unstable hemodynamics or refractory hypoxemia necessitating CPB or ECMO most often arise at one of three points in the operation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After clamping the pulmonary artery during the first transplant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After perfusing the first allograft but before starting the second lung</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After clamping the pulmonary artery during the second transplant</p><p/><p>Two series describe the rates of intraoperative conversion to CPB or ECMO, compared to procedures without extracorporeal support or with elective support.

These results compare with unadjusted survival rates for primary lung transplantation of 88 percent at 3 months, 80 percent at 1 year, 53 percent at 5 years, and 32 percent at 10 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study, the outcomes of 354 retransplants were compared with 10,846 primary transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Analyzing retransplant patients matched for confounding variables with primary transplant recipients, no difference in survival time was noted, although there was a significant increase in the risk of death in the overall retransplant group. Lower serum creatinine and better functional status were predictors of better survival in the retransplant group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest single-center experience, retransplantation represented 8.5 percent of 614 lung transplant procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Among the retransplant patients, those with bronchiolitis obliterans due to chronic graft rejection had an equivalent outcome to primary lung transplant (63 percent 5 year survival). In contrast, retransplant for airway dehiscence or acute primary graft failure resulted in greater than 50 percent mortality at one year after operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/44,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,51</a>]. Patients' ambulatory status was a strong predictor of survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival of lung retransplant recipients depends in part on the type of chronic lung graft dysfunction (CLAD) that necessitated retransplantation: bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) or restrictive CLAD, both of which are manifestations of chronic lung allograft rejection. In a series of 143 retransplant recipients composed of 94 (66 percent) with BOS and 49 with restrictive CLAD, those with restrictive CLAD redeveloped CLAD earlier and were more likely to redevelop restrictive CLAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Additionally, survival after retransplant for restrictive CLAD was worse than after retransplant for BOS, adjusted hazard ratio 2.61 (95% CI 1.51-4.51).</p><p/><p>Following retransplantation, BOS develops in a greater proportion of retransplant recipients than primary lung recipients. BOS occurred within one year in 17 percent of lung retransplant recipients and in 9 percent of primary lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. By five years, BOS occurred in 53 percent of lung retransplant recipients and in 40 percent of primary lung transplant recipients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Once the recipient is identified, arrangements are made to retrieve the lung allograft from the donor, preserve and transport the allograft, and prepare the recipient for surgery. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An endotracheal tube designed to facilitate one lung ventilation (OLV) is used during the procedure. Protective ventilation strategies are employed during OLV to minimize lung injury. (See <a href=\"#H813216051\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single lung transplantation (SLT) is performed through a posterolateral or anterolateral incision, while bilateral lung transplantation (BLT) is performed through a transverse thoracosternotomy or bilateral anterolateral incisions. During BLT, the lungs are implanted separately and sequentially. (See <a href=\"#H813216051\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bronchial anastomosis is a particularly vulnerable site for complications, as the bronchial blood supply to the donor airway is disrupted during transplantation. The bronchial anastomosis is typically performed using an end-to-end technique. Neither omental wrapping nor bronchial revascularization has reduced airway complications. (See <a href=\"#H260726781\" class=\"local\">'Bronchial anastomosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracorporeal cardiorespiratory support is generally needed for pediatric recipients, adult recipients with pulmonary vascular disease, and in about one-third of other patients. Extracorporeal cardiorespiratory support can be provided via cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), although ECMO is often preferred due to the decreased risk of bleeding complications and improved posttransplant outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H3924973028\" class=\"local\">'Extracorporeal cardiorespiratory support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Living donor lobar transplantation is an infrequently used option for carefully selected recipients who seem unlikely to survive until cadaveric lungs become available. One, three, and five year survivals parallel those for cadaveric lung transplant. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Living donor lobar transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The postoperative settings for mechanical ventilation are dependent on the underlying lung disease and whether a native (diseased) lung is still present, but generally follow a low tidal volume (eg, 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> predicted body weight), &quot;lung protective&quot; strategy. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) greater than 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is avoided after single lung transplantation for COPD, but PEEP 5 to 10 cm H2O is typical after SLT for other indications and after BLT. Weaning may be prolonged in patients transplanted for pulmonary hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Ventilatory support and weaning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) represents a multifactorial injury to the transplanted lung occurring in the first 72 hours after implantation. Inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitric oxide</a> (iNO) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be useful in the management of severe cases of PGD. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Management of primary graft dysfunction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-lung-graft-dysfunction#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary lung graft dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection is begun intraoperatively with a loading dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>. Most centers administer an induction agent immediately postoperatively, followed by initiation of a three-drug maintenance regimen. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Initiation of immunosuppression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric prophylaxis against bacterial, fungal, and viral infection is routinely administered perioperatively. Coverage may be expanded to potential pathogens that are isolated from the donor or recipient. In the absence of specific culture results, most centers use an empiric initial regimen such as the one in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78763 \">table 1</a>) and adjust it based on culture results. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Infection prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung function generally improves over the first three to six months after transplant. Subsequent declines may be an early sign of rejection. Home monitoring of forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second is used by many transplant centers to identify rejection. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Lung function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine surveillance transbronchial biopsy is controversial, but our practice is to perform surveillance transbronchial biopsy once a month for the first three months after transplantation, then at six months and one year. After one year, surveillance is determined by the rejection history during the first year. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Flexible bronchoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retransplantation should be considered only for carefully selected patients who are ambulatory and who would meet most, if not all, other general guidelines for a first transplant. Retransplantation for chronic graft rejection appears to have a better outcome than retransplantation for airway dehiscence or acute primary graft failure. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Retransplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Trulock EP.
