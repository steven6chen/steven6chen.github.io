The word doctors use for fluid in the belly is &quot;ascites.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956427\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes fluid in the belly?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of fluid in the belly is a liver condition called &quot;cirrhosis.&quot; Cirrhosis is a disease that scars the liver. The liver is a big organ in the upper right side of the belly. Cirrhosis is usually caused by heavy alcohol use or certain liver infections.</p><p>Other causes of fluid in the belly are not as common, but can include heart problems, cancer, and certain infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956442\"><span class=\"h1\">What symptoms does fluid in the belly cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid in the belly can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A big belly, which can lead to belly pain &ndash; The belly usually gets bigger over a short period of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight gain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling full after eating only a small amount of food</p><p/><p>Sometimes, the fluid in the belly can get infected. This can cause worse belly pain, fever, and sometimes confusion. If you have fluid in your belly and then get any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956457\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To look for fluid in your belly, your doctor will do an imaging test such as an ultrasound or CT scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>Many people also have a procedure called &quot;paracentesis.&quot; For this procedure, your doctor will put a needle into your belly and into the collection of fluid. (He or she will numb the area of skin where the needle goes in.) Your doctor will remove a sample of fluid and send it to a lab for tests. These tests can show what's causing the fluid to collect and if the fluid is infected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956472\"><span class=\"h1\">How is fluid in the belly treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends partly on what's causing the fluid to collect and how severe your condition is.</p><p>If you have cirrhosis, your treatment will probably involve:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following a low-salt (also called &quot;low-sodium&quot;) diet &ndash; This can help reduce the amount of fluid in your belly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking a medicine called a &quot;diuretic&quot; &ndash; Diuretics make people urinate much more than usual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stopping your alcohol use (if you drink alcohol)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding medicines called &quot;NSAIDs&quot; that can harm the liver &ndash; NSAIDs are a group of medicines that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Checking your weight every day &ndash; Following your weight will help your doctor monitor your condition.</p><p/><p>Treatment also depends on your symptoms. If you have severe symptoms, symptoms that don't get better with treatment, or symptoms that come back after treatment, you might need to have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paracentesis to remove a large amount of fluid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called &quot;TIPS&quot; in which a doctor puts a device in your liver that reduces fluid build-up</p><p/><p>Both of these treatments can help improve your symptoms so you feel better.</p><p>If you have severe liver disease, your doctor will talk with you about the possibility of having a liver transplant. A liver transplant is surgery in which a doctor replaces a diseased liver with a healthy liver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956487\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I prevent more fluid from collecting in my belly?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can help prevent more fluid from collecting by following all of your doctor's instructions about treatment.</p><p>Let your doctor or nurse know if you are having trouble following the treatment plan. For example, if you are having trouble following a low-salt diet, your doctor or nurse can recommend a dietitian (food expert) to help you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7956502\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alcohol use &mdash; when is drinking a problem?
