In most cases, these conditions are temporary and gradually resolve as anesthetic agents are metabolized and eliminated. Rarely, the cause is a serious medical or neurologic condition that requires urgent intervention.</p><p>This topic will review the causes and management of delayed emergence and emergence delirium after general anesthesia. Management of persistent postoperative delirium is addressed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other problems that occur in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) are discussed separately.

Most patients transition smoothly from a surgical anesthetic state (Stage III) to an awake state with intact protective reflexes (Stage I) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F107796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107796 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-emergence-and-emergence-delirium-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. After emergence in the operating room, transport to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) is typically accomplished when the patient has been extubated and is breathing spontaneously with adequate oxygenation and ventilation, is hemodynamically stable, and can be aroused to follow simple verbal commands (eg, eye opening or hand squeezing).</p><p>Most patients become more fully conscious (ie, awake and aware of surroundings and identity) within approximately 15 minutes of extubation, and all patients should be responsive within 60 minutes after the last administration of any sedative, opioid, or anesthetic agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-emergence-and-emergence-delirium-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, the time required for return of consciousness varies depending on the specific anesthetic agents employed; dosing, duration, and timing of last administration; the type and duration of the surgical procedure; and the patient's preoperative physical and mental status. (See <a href=\"#H1347519796\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2545165333\"><span class=\"h1\">DELAYED EMERGENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urgent evaluation, diagnosis, and management of causes of delayed emergence is necessary in a patient who is unresponsive or awakening more slowly than expected after general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence#H283253221\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;, section on 'Emergence from general anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>Initial treatment for delayed emergence is to ensure adequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade and allow additional time for elimination of residual anesthetic agents, with continued close monitoring and controlled or assisted ventilation, if necessary. After extubation, patients with excessive somnolence are frequently stimulated to assess level of sedation, encourage adequate ventilation, and reestablish orientation. Typically, these measures result in a gradual return to full consciousness.</p><p>If the patient remains unresponsive or heavily sedated 30 to 60 minutes after last administration of any anesthetic or adjuvant agent, further evaluation and treatment target the most common as well as the most serious conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106211\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106211 \">table 2</a>). All possibilities are considered and quickly and simultaneously assessed since multiple factors may be causative (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106223 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1984581323\"><span class=\"h2\">Consider specific drug effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Residual effect of one or more anesthetic or adjuvant agents is the most common cause of delayed emergence. Residual effect of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) is also considered, since muscle weakness may result in hypoventilation, causing hypoxemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypercapnia, which may further exacerbate sedation.</p><p>Discontinuation of anesthetic and analgesic agents is confirmed. An assessment is made of the total and most recent doses of each anesthetic and adjuvant agent. Occasionally, a dosing error or accidental administration of an unintended anesthetic or adjuvant drug (eg, a syringe swap) may contribute to delayed emergence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1347519796\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following drug-drug interactions<strong> </strong>may exacerbate residual drug effects and delay emergence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Combinations of anesthetic and adjuvant agents </strong>&ndash; When anesthetic drugs from different classes are combined, the central nervous system (CNS) effects are often synergistic.

Perioperative dosage adjustment in such patients may minimize accumulation of these drugs and avoid delayed emergence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age and weight</strong> &ndash; Age-related changes in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics intensify and prolong CNS effects of anesthetic and adjuvant agents in older adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-older-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the older adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Standard drug dosing in patients with very low body weight may result in absolute overdose, while relative overdose is common in obese patients who receive weight-based dosing of anesthetic agents.

In addition, hypercapnia due to opioid-induced hypoventilation may further exacerbate sedation. A finding of miosis and bradypnea along with sedation suggests that opioids may be contributing to delayed emergence, particularly if a recent or high opioid dose was administered.</p><p>Frequent stimulation of the patient usually results in arousal and adequate ventilation. Heavily sedated patients with severe respiratory depression may require a longer period of controlled ventilation in the operating room prior to extubation or temporary bag-mask positive pressure ventilation in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), if frequent stimulation does not result in adequate oxygenation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-problems-in-the-post-anesthesia-care-unit-pacu#H3589489451\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory problems in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)&quot;, section on 'Ventilatory support'</a>.)</p><p>If opioid overdose is the most likely cause of heavy sedation, then a small dose of IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> 40 to 80 mcg may be administered. Administration of naloxone may avoid reintubation, and also rules out opioid-induced alteration in mental status to allow evaluation of other possible causes. Repeat 40 mcg doses of naloxone may be administered at two- to five-minute intervals until the patient is responsive, without evidence of respiratory depression. The half-life of naloxone is 1 to 1.5 hours, which may be shorter than the half-life of the opioid being reversed. In rare cases, a continuous infusion of naloxone is necessary to treat recurrent respiratory depression, with close observation and titration of the infusion rate according to patient response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106215 \">table 5</a>). The effective dose varies, depending on the amount of opioid the patient has received, the patient's weight, and the degree of opioid penetrance into the CNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-emergence-and-emergence-delirium-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Although low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> are generally safe, this agent is not routinely administered and is always carefully titrated to effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-emergence-and-emergence-delirium-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Risks of naloxone administration include acute severe pain due to sudden reversal of analgesic effects of the opioid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-emergence-and-emergence-delirium-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and uncommon severe adverse cardiopulmonary effects (eg, arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-emergence-and-emergence-delirium-in-adults/abstract/14,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16-18</a>], severe hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-emergence-and-emergence-delirium-in-adults/abstract/14,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19-22</a>], flash pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-emergence-and-emergence-delirium-in-adults/abstract/14,23-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23-29</a>]).

Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> is commonly administered, it is infrequently a primary cause of persistent sedation because of its brief duration of action.

The initial adult dose of flumazenil is 0.2 mg IV over 30 seconds. Repeated doses of 0.2 mg may be given until the desired effect is achieved, up to a maximum dose of 1 mg. Since flumazenil may be shorter acting than the benzodiazepine being reversed, the patient is closely monitored for recurrence of sedation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoventilation. Flumazenil dosing may be repeated, but no more than 3 mg may be administered within a given hour.

(See <a href=\"#H1347519796\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Recovery from an IV sedative-hypnotic infusion depends on the agent's context-sensitive half time (the time required for plasma concentrations to decline by 50 percent following discontinuation of a steady-state infusion), as well as the duration of infusion. For example, recovery time and awakening typically occur &lt;25 minutes after discontinuation of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> infusion administered at maintenance doses for three hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-emergence-and-emergence-delirium-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence#H7869294\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;, section on 'Total intravenous anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>There are no reversal agents for any IV sedative-hypnotic.

Halothane and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a> are eliminated more slowly than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>. These factors may delay emergence and subsequent extubation in the operating room. Since there are no reversal agents for volatile inhalation anesthetics, continued ventilatory support is necessary to eliminate residual anesthetic.

Thus, patients are stimulated frequently to encourage adequate ventilation during transport from the operating room and the first several minutes in the PACU.
