More than two-thirds of pancreas transplants are performed as simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplants, with the remainder performed as sequential pancreas after kidney (PAK) transplant or pancreas transplant alone (PTA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>While SPK transplantation usually employs grafts procured from a single deceased donor, PAK typically involves transplantation of a deceased-donor pancreas graft into a recipient with a functioning living- or deceased-donor kidney allograft. Selected patients without substantial renal disease may be candidates for PTA.</p><p>The benefits and nonimmunologic complications associated with combined or sequential kidney-pancreas transplantation in patients with diabetes mellitus are presented here. Patient selection for and the clinical approach to these procedures are discussed separately.

The decreased mortality is due in part to the well-established survival benefit conferred by kidney transplantation (ie, even without pancreas transplantation) compared with dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-after-renal-transplantation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Survival compared with dialysis'</a>.)</p><p>The improved quality of life is due to freedom from frequent blood sugar monitoring, insulin therapy, hypoglycemia, and dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p>Our understanding of the relative benefits of simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) compared with kidney transplantation alone (KTA) is hampered by the absence of any randomized trials. All of the claims regarding the benefits of pancreas transplantation are based on limited and generally poorly controlled studies. Combined kidney-pancreas transplantation via normalization of glycemia should theoretically decrease the long-term retinal, nephrologic, neurologic, and macrovascular complications of diabetes. However, no randomized studies have been performed, and studies of secondary complications of diabetes must be interpreted in light of the fact that most patients undergoing pancreas transplantation have had diabetes for over two decades and often have advanced-stage complications. The majority of studies examining the effect of pancreas transplant on the secondary complications of diabetes are older, inadequately powered, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lack appropriate control groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p>The majority of patients who undergo SPK have type 1 diabetes. However, the procedure may also confer benefits for selected patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Survival rates after SPK are comparable between patients with types 1 and 2 diabetes when adjusted for other risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. An analysis of data obtained from the Organ Procurement and Transplant <span class=\"nowrap\">Network/United</span> Network for Organ Sharing <span class=\"nowrap\">(OPTN/UNOS)</span> showed no difference between patients with types 1 and 2 diabetes in the rate of death or kidney or pancreas failure once adjustments for age, race, body weight, dialysis time, and cardiovascular comorbidities were made. It is difficult to adequately adjust between such different groups, however.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100158167\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survival for SPK recipients is better than that of waitlisted patients who continue to receive dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In a retrospective review of 351 dialysis patients with type 1 diabetes, at seven years, survival rates were higher among 130 who underwent SPK compared with 190 who remained on the waiting list (77 versus 40 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension and other clinical characteristics were similar between groups. However, it is well established that patients who undergo KTA (ie, without pancreas) have a better survival than those who are eligible for transplantation but remain on the waiting list. Whether the contribution of the pancreas transplant adds to the mortality benefit of kidney transplantation is less clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-after-renal-transplantation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Survival compared with dialysis'</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with type 1 diabetes, the simultaneous transplantation of kidney and pancreas (ie, SPK) appears to confer a better survival than KTA, at least compared with a deceased-donor kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13,15-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15-23</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small, 10-year study evaluated outcomes after SPK in 14 patients with type 1 diabetes and end-stage diabetic nephropathy versus 15 diabetics subjected to deceased-donor KTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Ten-year mortality was significantly lower among those who underwent SPK (20 versus 80 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of 18,549 patients with type 1 diabetes reported that eight-year survival was similar for SPK (72 percent) and living-donor kidney recipients (72 percent), but higher than that observed for deceased-donor kidney recipients (55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient survival was evaluated among 130, 379, and 296 recipients of living-related-donor kidneys, SPKs, and deceased-donor kidneys, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patient survival was significantly lower for the deceased-donor group versus that observed with recipients of living-related-donor kidneys and SPKs.</p><p/><p>These data suggest a survival benefit conferred by combined transplantation compared with KTA, at least from a deceased donor.</p><p>It is less clear whether SPK has any benefit over KTA from a living donor. In some, but not all, patients, SPK is associated with better survival compared with KTA from a living donor. The potentially superior benefit gained by SPK versus living-donor KTA generally depends on the early function of the pancreas allograft. SPK recipients who have good pancreas function early on tend to do better than living-donor KTA recipients. This was shown in an analysis of <span class=\"nowrap\">OPTN/UNOS</span> registry data. At 72 months, patient survival was similar between SPK and living-donor KTA (84 versus 80 percent at 72 months, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. After adjusting for multiple variables, compared with SPK recipients, living-donor KTA recipients had a lower risk of graft failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.61-0.83) and patient death (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.94).</p><p>However, in a more detailed analysis of the same data in which SPK recipients were stratified based on the pancreas function at one year, patient survival at 84 months posttransplant was highest in SPK recipients with a functioning pancreas graft 12 months posttransplant, followed by living-donor KTA, SPK recipients with a nonfunctioning pancreas, and deceased-donor KTA (89, 80, 74, and 65 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Kidney allograft survival was also highest in SPK recipients with a functioning pancreas.</p><p>Some patients receive a living-donor KTA as the first option and then subsequently receive a pancreas (ie, pancreas after kidney [PAK]). There is an initial increase in mortality among such patients. In a retrospective study of over 11,000 diabetics on the waitlist from 1995 to 2000, mortality within four years of transplantation was evaluated among those who underwent PAK, SPK, and pancreas transplantation alone (PTA) versus patients waiting for the same procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Overall relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality at four years was significantly higher for those who underwent PAK versus those on the waitlist for PAK (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03-1.94), primarily due to mortality within the first three months.</p><p>The long-term benefits of PAK on patient survival are not clearly evident. In one study that used data from 1995 through 2003, multivariate analysis demonstrated a similar mortality among diabetic patients who underwent PAK compared with those on the waiting list for PAK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>A more recent study based on the UNOS database between 1997 and 2007 compared living-donor KTA with a functional allograft at one year (n = 2989) versus pancreas after living kidney transplant that had occurred within the first year post-kidney transplantation (n = 484) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Compared with living-donor KTA and after adjusting for multiple donor- and recipient-related factors, despite the initial increase in mortality, PAK recipients had a nonsignificant trend toward better survival at eight-year follow-up (adjusted HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.57-1.07).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516802952\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney allograft survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, kidney allograft survival rates among type 1 diabetic recipients of SPK are generally comparable with those seen with living-donor kidney allografts alone and superior to those observed after deceased-donor kidney allografts alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The reason for the improved kidney allograft survival among SPK recipients compared with recipients of deceased-donor kidney allografts alone likely reflects the effects of prolonged euglycemia in recipients with functional pancreas allografts, differences in the type 1 diabetic patients who are selected for SPK versus kidney allograft alone, and organ quality. Overall, SPK candidates are younger and more often pre-emptively transplanted using younger donors, with minimization of cold-ischemia times (CITs) and use of induction agents.</p><p>The beneficial effects of the pancreas allograft on kidney allograft survival in SPK are evident when outcomes are stratified by time from transplantation. One study demonstrated that, after 10 years of transplantation, kidney allografts in SPK were less likely to have allograft failure compared with deceased-donor KTA (adjusted HR 0.58, CI 0.40-0.84) and living-donor KTA (adjusted HR 0.63, CI 0.40-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>These benefits were also reported in short-term follow-up based on the function of the pancreas at one year. Kidney allografts in SPK recipients who had a functional pancreas at one year had significantly better survival compared with kidney allografts in deceased-donor KTAs and living-donor KTAs, whereas recipients with a failed pancreas at one year (13 percent) had higher probability of kidney failure and higher mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Retrospective data suggest that SPK performed prior to the need for dialysis (eg, pre-emptive transplantation) may be associated with improved renal allograft survival compared with SPK after the initiation of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Pre-emptive SPK transplantation may also be associated with improved long-term patient survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Similar observations have been made for pre-emptive transplantation of renal allografts alone.

However, basal and stimulated peripheral serum insulin concentrations are two to three times higher than normal in recipients of pancreas grafts with systemic venous drainage. The hyperinsulinemia is due to the delivery of insulin into the systemic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>] so that first-pass hepatic uptake and degradation, which removes 50 to 90 percent of the insulin reaching the liver via the portal vein, are bypassed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Glucose counterregulation after hypoglycemia also improves after pancreas transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,34,35</a>]. Most recipients have had diabetes for many years and therefore have abnormal counterregulation of hypoglycemia due to decreased glucagon and epinephrine responses (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>). Glucagon responses are normalized and epinephrine responses are improved after successful pancreas transplantation.

PTA may reverse established diabetic lesions in patients with early diabetic nephropathy. In one series, functional and structural analyses of the native kidneys were performed after successful pancreatic transplantation in 13 patients with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. These patients began with a normal creatinine clearance; nine had moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;), and four had overt proteinuria. When compared at five years with a control group treated with conventional insulin therapy, those with PTA had a lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due presumably to the nephrotoxic effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>; however, histologic changes of diabetic nephropathy (increased mesangial and glomerular volume) were stable versus an increase in the control group. Subsequent follow-up of eight of these patients at 10 years suggests that successful pancreas transplantation can eventually reverse established lesions of diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

All of these patients had pancreas graft survival exceeding 10 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These kidney ultrastructural benefits of euglycemia were also shown in kidney allografts. A study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus examined kidney allograft structure in living KTA (n = 17) and in SPK recipients (n = 25).

None with advanced-grade or laser-treated diabetic retinopathy were improved in either group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fracture risk -</strong> The risk of fracture may be lower following SPK compared with that after kidney transplantation. This was suggested by a retrospective analysis of 11,145 diabetic transplant recipients (4933 SPK and 6212 kidney-alone recipients) who were identified from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. After adjusting for multiple covariates, SPK was associated with a lower fracture risk (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66&ndash;0.96). The protective effect of SPK on fracture was particularly noted among men. The reasons underlying the apparent protective effect of SPK fractures cannot be determined from this retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition to the above, the International Pancreas Transplant Registry (IPTR) has reported 47 pregnancies among 34 kidney-pancreas recipients, which resulted in 38 live, healthy infants. Excellent metabolic control was observed with all pregnancies. Adverse results included the loss of a pancreas and a kidney allograft in two patients and the acceleration of retinopathy in another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">General</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications are generally the most severe the first year posttransplant and generally relate to the surgery or the immunosuppression that is required.</p><p>Due to perioperative complications, greater morbidity and early mortality is associated with simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) compared with kidney transplantation alone (KTA). This is reflected by longer initial hospital stay, more frequent rehospitalization during the first year posttransplant, greater severity of illness requiring rehospitalization, and increased risk of perioperative mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26,63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,63-66</a>].

Pancreas graft failure has been defined by resumption of diabetes medications, which may include any chronic medication, insulin only, or medications near or exceeding those required pretransplant. Pancreas graft failure has also been defined by absence of measured C-peptide or by elevated HbA1c levels. Taking this important limitation into consideration, the one- and five-year unadjusted pancreas graft survival rates in SPK recipients are approximately 89 and 75 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Five-year graft survival for PTA and PAK transplants is inferior to SPK, at 57 and 59 percent, respectively. The inferior graft survival among PAK compared with SPK recipients has been attributed to the additional antigenic stimulus provided by an unrelated pancreas graft. The inferior graft survival among PTA compared with SPK recipients may be related to the difficulty in assessing for rejection in the absence of a simultaneously transplanted kidney.</p><p>The technical failure rate for pancreas recipients in the United States is approximately 8 percent and accounts for over half of graft losses within the first posttransplant year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/63,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,68,69</a>]. Technical failure includes irreversible graft loss due to thrombosis, hemorrhage, graft pancreatitis, anastomotic leak, or local infection necessitating graft removal. Graft thrombosis is the most common complication. Graft thrombosis occurs primarily in the first week following transplant and is associated with graft pancreatitis, hypotension, reperfusion injury, and prolonged cold-ischemia times (CITs), as well as hypercoagulable states.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544458249\"><span class=\"h3\">Donor factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Donor factors influence surgical complications, technical failures, and long-term pancreas allograft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].</p><p>In a single-center study, technical failure (defined as graft loss within the first 90 days following transplantation) was 10.2 percent.

Increased PDRI was significantly associated with graft loss within the first posttransplant year for all pancreas transplants. Donors with PDRI less than 1.16 (SPK) or less than 0.86 (solitary pancreas) had the best survival probability at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>These models can be used to improve the utilization of donors perceived to be higher risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544461796\"><span class=\"h3\">Recipient factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recipients over age 45 years carry a twofold greater risk of graft loss, most often due to technical failure, and a threefold greater risk of dying than younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

The hyponatremia is presumably due to the combination of hypovolemia-induced stimulation of the release of antidiuretic hormone and the replacement of solute-rich pancreatic secretions with free water. As a result, many SPK recipients with bladder drainage require chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> supplementation; the dose is often as high as 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Problems with acidosis and volume depletion are greatly reduced with enteric exocrine drainage of the pancreas graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-and-complications-associated-with-kidney-pancreas-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].

Procedures include a simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant, pancreas transplant alone (PTA), and sequential pancreas after kidney (PAK) transplant. While SPK usually employs grafts procured from a single deceased donor, PAK typically involves transplantation of a cadaveric pancreas graft into a recipient with a functioning living- or deceased-donor kidney allograft. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major benefits of combined kidney-pancreas transplantation are decreased mortality and improved quality of life. The decreased mortality is due in part to the well-established survival benefit conferred by kidney transplantation (ie, even without pancreas transplantation) compared with dialysis. Our understanding of the relative benefits of SPK compared with kidney transplantation alone (KTA) is hampered by the absence of any randomized trials. All of the claims regarding the benefits of pancreas transplantation are based on limited and generally poorly controlled studies. Potential benefits of combined kidney-pancreas transplantation include improved glucose and lipid metabolism, possibly a decrease in the risk of recurrent diabetic nephropathy, and stabilization and improvement in neuropathy and retinopathy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Other potential benefits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient survival may vary based on the specific surgical procedure and the source of the donor kidney. In general, patient survival is higher following SPK transplantation compared with deceased-donor KTA. (See <a href=\"#H100158167\" class=\"local\">'Patient survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival following SPK compared with living-donor kidney alone depends on the early function of the pancreas allograft. Patients with one year of a functional pancreas allograft following SPK transplantation have a better survival compared with living-donor kidney transplantation, whereas a failed pancreas allograft predisposes a patient to a worse outcome. (See <a href=\"#H100158167\" class=\"local\">'Patient survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonimmunologic complications are generally the most severe the first year posttransplant and generally relate to the surgery or the immunosuppression required. Technical failures occur in approximately 8 percent of recipients, with graft thrombosis as the leading cause. Other common complications include graft pancreatitis, infections (intra-abdominal, urinary), wound issues, and systemic viral infections.
