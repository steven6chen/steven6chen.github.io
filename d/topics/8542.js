Low serum testosterone levels in HIV-infected men may be associated with a variety of manifestations including fatigue, decreased libido and erectile dysfunction, weight loss, muscle wasting, and bone loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypogonadism-in-hiv-infected-males/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Hypogonadism in a male refers to a decrease in one or both of the two major functions of the testes: sperm production and testosterone production. These abnormalities can result from disease of the testes (primary hypogonadism) or malfunction of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland (secondary hypogonadism).

The first step is to check luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism#H13715979\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of male hypogonadism&quot;, section on 'Additional testing to determine etiology'</a>). In HIV-infected patients on potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), androgen deficiency is more often a consequence of secondary, rather than primary, hypogonadism, but the pathogenesis is unclear in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypogonadism-in-hiv-infected-males/abstract/2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Secondary hypogonadism</strong> &ndash; Normal or low levels of LH and FSH in the setting of a low testosterone level suggest secondary hypogonadism. Such patients should be evaluated for possible reversible etiologies of gonadotropin deficiency, such as hyperprolactinemia and hemochromatosis, by checking serum prolactin and iron studies, although frequently no specific disorder is identified. We also evaluate other hormones that reflect anterior pituitary function (eg, free T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], cortisol, insulin growth factor [IGF]-1). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of secondary hypogonadism in males&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In HIV-infected patients with advanced immunodeficiency (CD4 cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL),</span> secondary hypogonadism may rarely result from opportunistic infections (eg, <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>) affecting the pituitary gland or hypothalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypogonadism-in-hiv-infected-males/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The initial dose can then be titrated based on testosterone levels that are measured mid-way between injections, with the goal of achieving a level in the mid-normal range.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7069530\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For each of the indications described above, we continue testosterone replacement therapy as long as there is clinical benefit and no significant adverse effects. If there is no effect on symptoms after three months of testosterone replacement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adverse effects occur, the treatment should be discontinued.</p><p>In clinical practice, sometimes patients presenting for care are on testosterone therapy for unclear indications. Checking luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in a patient receiving exogenous testosterone is not useful since gonadotropins will be suppressed. Because there are no evidence-based guidelines regarding whether to continue testosterone in this setting, the decision must be individualized, taking into consideration the risks and benefits of treatment as well as patient preference. If testosterone is discontinued in these patients, it may take months for endogenous gonadal function to resume and may not be well tolerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2211589\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testosterone replacement therapy can cause acne and emotional lability in some patients. With chronic administration, patients can also develop erythrocytosis and testicular atrophy. Preexisting sleep apnea may also worsen.</p><p>The patch or gel methods can be associated with skin irritation, and injections may cause injection-site reactions.

Low serum testosterone levels in HIV-infected men may be associated with a variety of manifestations including fatigue, decreased libido and erectile dysfunction, weight loss, muscle wasting, and bone loss. (See <a href=\"#H29753725\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of hypogonadism in HIV-infected men has been observed to be lower since the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and its earlier initiation in their care. (See <a href=\"#H29753739\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for hypogonadism in HIV-infected men include increasing age, symptomatic infection, use of certain medications (eg, systemic glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a>), and chronic hepatitis C infection. (See <a href=\"#H29753767\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general approach to the evaluation of testosterone deficiency in the HIV-infected patient is the same as in the seronegative patient. The clinical suspicion of hypogonadism is confirmed with a low serum testosterone level. Measurement of the serum total testosterone concentration is the initial test of choice based upon its simplicity and cost. (See <a href=\"#H2755542355\" class=\"local\">'Establishing the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing should be performed between 8 and 10 AM, and an abnormal level should be confirmed prior to treatment, as recommended in guidelines. Measurement of serum testosterone is not advised during an acute illness when androgen levels may transiently decline. (See <a href=\"#H1800422429\" class=\"local\">'Checking testosterone level'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the serum total testosterone concentration measured at 8 AM is in the lower half of the normal range in an HIV-infected patient with clinical hypogonadism, a free testosterone assay should be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H1800422429\" class=\"local\">'Checking testosterone level'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a patient has laboratory evidence of hypogonadism, further evaluation is necessary to determine if it is primary or secondary. Normal or low levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the setting of a low testosterone level suggest secondary hypogonadism. Increased LH and FSH levels in a patient with low serum testosterone suggest primary hypogonadism. Additional testing or imaging may be warranted to establish the specific etiology. (See <a href=\"#H2211299\" class=\"local\">'Determining the etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testosterone replacement therapy is indicated in HIV-infected patients with a low serum testosterone level and symptoms of androgen deficiency (eg, fatigue, hot <span class=\"nowrap\">flashes/sweats,</span> decreased libido, erectile dysfunction), unexplained weight loss, or low bone mineral density. (See <a href=\"#H3568515893\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before initiating testosterone replacement therapy, we recommend obtaining a complete blood count, glucose, renal and hepatic function, lipid panel, prostate-specific antigen, and performing a digital rectal examination (DRE). Additional evaluation may be warranted based upon presenting manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H106319273\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3201580869\" class=\"local\">'Assessment for other contributing factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally use one of the transdermal approaches (eg, patch or gel) as first-line treatment because of their ease of administration and more consistent drug delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F94118\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94118 \">table 1</a>). The testosterone patch is applied daily over the skin of the back, thigh, or upper arm. There are now several different testosterone gel formulations, which are applied daily over a covered area of nongenital skin. (See <a href=\"#H22157302\" class=\"local\">'Preparations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although testosterone treatment has been associated with clinical benefits in men with hypogonadism, many questions remain unanswered including the long-term effects of suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, as well as the possibility of promoting or unmasking malignancy of the prostate and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease or venous thromboembolism. (See <a href=\"#H12617787\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications and cautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical effectiveness, testosterone levels, and adverse drug effects should be monitored every three to six months. The target goal should be attainment of serum testosterone levels obtained in the morning in the mid-normal range.
