children is safer and more likely to be successful when the patient does not move and when any associated pain and anxiety are effectively controlled. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions that consider the child's developmental status and the clinical circumstances are often required to meet these goals. In addition, attention to the treatment of pain and anxiety associated with the child's condition is a requisite of acceptable and compassionate patient care. Specific issues related to the importance of addressing pain and anxiety in emergency medical systems has been emphasized in a clinical report from the American Academy of Pediatrics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The increased availability of short-acting sedatives along with accurate noninvasive monitoring and improved sedation training programs has enabled effective and safe management of sedation and analgesia outside the operating room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Procedural sedation is an evolving field practiced by a diverse group of practitioners in an expanding variety of clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among the challenges that must be addressed are the development of standardized definitions of outcomes, particularly with respect to what constitutes satisfactory sedation and what is an adverse event. In addition there remain a number of guidelines for sedation promulgated by a various specialty societies. Unified guidelines would encourage consistent care across specialties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF SEDATION AND ANALGESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Goals of sedation and analgesia for painful procedures are to [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain patient safety and welfare</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize physical pain and discomfort</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control anxiety, minimize psychological trauma, maximize amnesia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control behavior and movement to allow safe performance of procedures</p><p/><p>The clinician must determine the appropriate level of sedation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> analgesia required for a particular procedure. In addition to medications, non-pharmacological interventions, such as verbal reassurance, distraction techniques, and hypnosis may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1684879\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic interventions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attempts to codify sedation &quot;states&quot; have evolved over the last 30 years. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentists, and the Joint Commission of the United States use the following definitions to describe the depth of sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/3,5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Analgesia</strong> &ndash; Relief of pain without intentionally producing a sedated state. Altered mental status may be a secondary effect of medications administered for analgesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Minimal sedation</strong> &ndash; The patient responds normally to verbal commands. Cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, but ventilatory and cardiovascular function is unaffected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/analgesia</strong></span> &ndash; The patient has depression of consciousness but can respond purposefully to verbal commands either alone or accompanied by light touch. Maintains airway and adequate ventilation without intervention. Cardiovascular function is maintained. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Deep <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/analgesia</strong></span> &ndash; The patient cannot be easily aroused but responds purposefully to noxious stimulation. May require assistance to maintain airway and adequate ventilation. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>General anesthesia</strong> &ndash; The patient cannot be aroused. Often requires assistance to maintain airway and positive pressure ventilation. Cardiovascular function may be impaired.</p><p/><p>Guidelines and regulatory agencies also use these sedation depth descriptions to describe the relative risk state for a given patient, thus the level of provider care and monitoring varies with the sedation level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a general rule, the Joint Commission recommends that providers have the capability of managing patients one level deeper than the target depth. The progression from mild sedation to general anesthesia is a continuum and patients can easily move from one &quot;level&quot; of sedation to another. Patient response to sedation is highly variable, with some patients becoming deeply sedated after minimal doses and others requiring much higher doses. In addition, differentiation of these levels of sedation may be difficult or impossible during a given test or procedure for a given patient.</p><p>Members of the American College of Emergency Physicians have suggested the following definition for sedation induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dissociative sedation</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Ketamine</a> sedation is characterized by a dissociative trance-like, cataleptic state in which the patient experiences profound analgesia and amnesia, but retains airway protective reflexes, spontaneous respirations, and cardiopulmonary stability. </p><p/><p>Some experts have suggested that this state should be considered distinct from the sedation spectrum outlined above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. While potentially useful, this categorization of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a> sedation is not part of the standard definitions of sedation in other medical specialties or regulatory bodies described above. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room#H2152498\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic agents for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Ketamine'</a>.)</p><p>For the purposes of this article, &quot;procedural sedation&quot; refers to the broad spectrum of interventions that can be used to alter patient response so that tests and procedures can be accomplished and is not intended as an alternative term for the levels of sedation presented above. </p><p>&quot;Conscious sedation&quot; previously referred to a specific sedation state within the levels of sedation presented above. Because effective sedation usually impairs consciousness, this term is no longer used by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Society of Anesthesiologists when referring to sedation states.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1683199\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no absolute indications for the performance of procedural sedation in children. It may be used for any procedure in which a child's pain or anxiety may be excessive and movement may impede performance. The need for sedation will vary greatly with a child's developmental or behavioral status. Procedural sedation also facilitates deep relaxation and increases the chances of successful closed reduction of a dislocated joint or displaced fracture. </p><p>The targeted depth of sedation and the selection of medications largely depend upon the procedure performed, the anticipated degree of pain, and patient factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of medications for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The properties of the specific agents with respect to pediatric sedation are listed in the tables and discussed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83512\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83512 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83889\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83889 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic agents for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Procedures that commonly warrant procedural sedation in children include imaging by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, fracture reduction, complex laceration repair, lumbar puncture, abscess incision and drainage, instrumentation (eg, endoscopy, bronchoscopy), burn dressing change, and chest tube or central line placement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1683207\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are <strong>no</strong> absolute contraindications to procedural sedation outside the operating room in children. </p><p>Relative contraindications to procedural sedation include signs of a difficult airway or significant medical comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesia Classification III or higher). Those patients with ASA classes III, IV, and V (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F113973\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113973 \">table 3</a>), special needs, or airway abnormalities warrant consultation with a pediatric anesthesiologist or clinician with similar pediatric sedation expertise. A history of severe sleep apnea or airway abnormality is also an important consideration when planning sedation care. Children who readily obstruct their airway when asleep may do so during sedation and are at risk for excessive response to sedative medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room#H1560699\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparation for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Risk classification'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room#H11046848\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparation for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Airway assessment'</a>.) </p><p>True allergic reactions to commonly used sedation medications are rare. However, caregivers may report adverse events with specific classes of agents as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paradoxical reactions (patient becomes more agitated rather than sedated) may occur with benzodiazepines and barbiturates, especially in younger children. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Morphine</a> administration is associated with histamine release that may produce hives, especially in regions of the body where it is administered. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Fentanyl</a> is associated with nasal pruritus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agitation with emergence has been described with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>, barbiturates, and other sedatives. </p><p/><p>Of these, prior paradoxical reactions with benzodiazepines or emergence phenomenon after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a> may warrant avoidance of these agents for sedation in individual patients. </p><p>Procedural sedation should also be avoided in children for whom the risk of sedation outweighs the benefit. The patient's fasting status is a key consideration when assessing this risk. The purpose of fasting prior to sedation is to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. The use of prolonged fasting intervals prior to sedation remains an area of practice difference among clinicians providing sedation and anesthesia for children. Evidence regarding the optimum duration of fasting required to reduce the risk of aspiration during pediatric procedural sedation is limited. Patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease and acute or chronic decreased gastrointestinal motility are at higher risk of aspiration and aspiration precautions should be continued at all times. Patients known to have airways that are difficult to intubate, especially if mask ventilation is also difficult, may be challenging to rescue if sedation leads to airway obstruction. Clinicians should use fasting status, aspiration risk, airway difficulty and urgency of the procedure to decide the timing of sedation relative to last oral intake, the target depth of sedation, and the specific medications used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room#H11047750\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparation for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Fasting and aspiration risk'</a>.)</p><p>Certain patient factors have been associated with failed sedations, such as the inability to complete a procedure because of sedation complications. As an example, in a single-center, observational study of 606 pediatric patients who underwent deep sedation by experienced practitioners, several patient factors were associated with 83 failed sedations including the presence of an upper respiratory infection (URI), a history of obstructive sleep apnea of snoring, ASA class III status, older age, and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Of these, the presence of a URI is most modifiable. Thus, for elective procedures, patients with a URI may benefit from postponement until the illness is resolved, especially, if they have one or more of the other factors associated with failed sedation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1683215\"><span class=\"h1\">PERFORMING PROCEDURAL SEDATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6090197\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before performing procedural sedation, the clinician should obtain written informed consent from the caregiver. Key components of this consent include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proposed benefits, typically the ability to perform a procedure effectively while minimizing pain, anxiety, and psychological trauma </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Possible risks, which are often agent specific, but commonly include potential for airway compromise, hypoxia, and vomiting</p><p/><p>The consent process should include specific discussion of the drug options and potential routes of administration for procedural sedation as well as alternatives including local or regional anesthesia and, when appropriate, general anesthesia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1683014\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preparation for procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room is discussed in detail separately.

Because depression of consciousness is a continuum and responses to medications vary, clinicians must be able to deal with complications in patients whose level of sedation becomes deeper than intended or who experience an adverse reaction to medication. Competence in emergency airway management is mandatory if deep sedation is intended or possible and is strongly advised for lighter levels. </p><p>Prior to the start of procedural sedation, the clinician should ensure that monitoring devices are present and functioning properly and that oxygen, oxygen delivery devices, suction equipment, pediatric airway equipment, an emergency cart with appropriate medications, and a defibrillator are immediately available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room#H1560734\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparation for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Equipment'</a>.)</p><p>Administration of sedation requires at least two individuals, typically an advanced practice clinician (eg, physician, physician's assistant, advanced practice registered nurse, nurse anesthetist) and an assistant. In addition to the assistant, it is preferable to have two advanced practice clinicians present (one to administer the sedation, while the other performs the procedure) for moderate to deep sedation, whenever possible. At least one person present should be trained in advanced pediatric life support and be skilled in airway management and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In any case, there should be a competent individual available to continuously monitor breathing, vital signs, pulse oximetry, and, when available, end-tidal carbon dioxide. This individual should also be tasked to document vital signs, level of consciousness, drug administration, and any complications.

As a practical consideration, unnecessary stimulation, such as inflation of a blood pressure cuff, beginning a painful procedure, or familial separation may hinder the induction of sedation in a young or anxious child. Once a complete set of vital signs has been obtained, the child can be monitored visually until the sedative drugs have begun to take effect. At this point, monitoring of pulse oximetry and heart rate, at a minimum, should be initiated.</p><p>We suggest that monitoring of children receiving moderate or deep procedural sedation include ETCO2 detection throughout the procedure and during recovery. ETCO2 monitoring is increasingly available in many settings for nonintubated patients and may be helpful to assess ventilation during sedation and analgesia. Based upon trials in children and observational studies in children and adults, increases in ETCO2 may be detected in patients with respiratory depression before hypoventilation or hypoxemia is noted, particularly in those who are receiving supplemental oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. ETCO2 is also more sensitive for detecting hypoventilation and apnea than clinical assessment. These findings have been illustrated in the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial describing 163 children receiving procedural sedation for endoscopy, ETCO2 monitoring identified alveolar hypoventilation in 56 percent of procedures and apnea during 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Endoscopy staff observing the patients directly reported poor ventilation in 3 percent of all procedures and identified no apnea. Children who were stimulated after 15 seconds of hypoventilation were significantly less likely to develop arterial oxygen desaturation than those who were stimulated after 60 seconds of hypoventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal ETCO2 levels were observed in 60 percent of patients in a prospective sample of adults and children undergoing procedural sedation in an emergency department. Changes in ETCO2 occurred before oxygen desaturation or observed hypoventilation in 70 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective observational study describing adults undergoing procedural sedation in an emergency department, 58 percent had respiratory depression, as detected by ETCO2, at a time when they were readily responsive to verbal stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p>Taken together, these studies suggest that ETCO2 monitoring helps detect hypoventilation in a timely fashion, especially in patients receiving supplemental oxygen, and is an important adjunct to visual observation and pulse oximetry. Having noted these advantages, there are no studies that prove serious adverse events (eg, resuscitation from apnea or hospital admissions) are decreased by the use of ETCO2 monitoring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;, section on 'Procedural sedation'</a>.) </p><p>Bispectral index (BIS) is a measure of consciousness obtained by continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring of probes placed on the forehead. The EEG signal is processed by a proprietary computer algorithm. BIS was derived in adults and is used in some settings to monitor for awareness to anesthesia. It has a range of 0 (no brain activity) to 100 (alert). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Awareness with recall following general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Neuromonitoring'</a>.) </p><p>BIS is of uncertain value in monitoring children during procedural sedation because it varies in its prediction of sedation depth by patient age and sedative agent. As an example, in a combined analysis of four observational studies, BIS was found to differentiate light from moderate or deep sedation in children with reasonable sensitivity (74 to 83 percent) and specificity (78 to 84 percent). However, BIS differentiated moderate from deep sedation with poor sensitivity (58 to 71 percent) and specificity (57 to 66 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. BIS values in children were lower in infants and patients who received opioids. BIS values did not correlate with sedation depth in children receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>. Thus, BIS is not routinely recommended for monitoring of pediatric sedations outside of the operating room. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1440334089\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest the use of the Pediatric Sedation State Scale (PSSS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F113979\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113979 \">table 4</a>) to provide a simple means of effectively documenting and rapidly communicating the quality of pediatric sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Derived from expert opinion and validated using a small sample of patients and observers with high inter- and intra-observer agreement, the PSSS takes no more than 10 minutes to teach and consists of six levels of sedation that report on patient behavior, patient interference with the procedure, need for restraint, and physiologic parameters. </p><p>Assignment of scores may occur at regular intervals (eg, every 5 to 10 minutes). If the PSSS is used routinely for specific procedures, it has the potential to confirm that conditions were acceptable for each patient&rsquo;s sedation strategy. It may also offer a means to objectively compare different sedation techniques, including nonpharmacologic interventions, as part of quality improvement and clinical research efforts.</p><p>By contrast, scales that simply measure the depth of sedation track only one aspect of this practice because a patient does not necessarily need to be sedated deeply or at all to meet the goals of procedural sedation (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Goals of sedation and analgesia'</a> above). Many of these scales also do not permit the definition of &quot;dangerous&quot; states where patient physiology is <strong>not</strong> under good control such as hypoxia, hypotension, or bradycardia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684879\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpharmacologic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacologic interventions include behavioral and cognitive approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. For many children, the use of nonpharmacologic interventions may prevent the need for procedural sedation. In situations where the patient is conscious during the sedation, behavioral and cognitive approaches are complementary to pharmacologic interventions and should be used. These techniques also help to reduce preprocedural agitation which permits an easier transition to sedation, may reduce the amount of medication required for effective sedation, and may decrease the frequency of adverse events, including emergence phenomena.

In a report describing 30,037 prospectively collected hospital-based pediatric <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/anesthesia</span> encounters from sedation services at multiple institutions with 77 percent of the sedations performed by anesthesiologists, emergency physicians, or intensivists, the overall incidence of adverse events (primarily transient oxygen desaturation, vomiting, and excessive secretions) was 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Laryngospasm and apnea occurred less commonly and there were no deaths. One patient was successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest. In a report from a single center sedation service that performs over 3000 sedations annually, failed sedation, defined as complications necessitating postponement of further sedation without completion of the procedure, occurred in up to 1.5 percent of sedations. Thus, adverse events are relatively common in pediatric procedural sedation, but when personnel rapidly respond and reverse the adverse event, deleterious outcomes are rare. </p><p>The consequences of an adverse event that is not immediately recognized and treated can be devastating. In one retrospective report describing adverse sedation events in children, the deleterious outcomes of permanent neurologic injury or death was associated with adverse events that occurred in nonhospital-based facilities and with those for which resuscitative efforts were inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].
