Patients who are overweight or obese may intentionally lose weight to improve their health. However, progressive unintentional (involuntary) weight loss often indicates a serious medical or psychiatric illness.</p><p>This topic will discuss the approach to unintentional weight loss in the adult patient. Weight loss and nutritional issues in older adults and weight loss or inadequate weight gain in children and adolescents is discussed separately.

This term excludes weight loss as an expected consequence of treatment (eg, weight loss from diuretic therapy in patients with heart failure) or as a result of a known illness. Clinically important weight loss is generally defined as loss of more than 5 percent of usual body weight over 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinically significant weight loss and nutritional issues in older adult patients is discussed elsewhere.

It is generally defined as weight loss from loss of muscle mass (with or without fat loss). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Assessment and management of anorexia and cachexia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric nutrition: Nutritional issues in older adults&quot;, section on 'Cachexia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sarcopenia</strong> &ndash; Sarcopenia is a geriatric syndrome characterized by loss of muscle mass, strength, and performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

It is estimated that 15 to 20 percent of adults &ge;65 years have unintentional weight loss if followed over 5 to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Up to 8 percent of outpatients will have unintentional weight loss. Many studies, especially of nursing home residents, report a prevalence of weight loss exceeding 50 percent, which is most commonly multifactorial and associated with functional decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>There are fewer estimates of the incidence or prevalence of weight loss in the general population. The best evidence comes from survey studies. One survey including a representative sample of over 9000 adults in the United States found that 5 percent of participants reported unintentional<strong> </strong>weight loss of at least 5 percent of their usual body weight during the preceding year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There were no important differences in weight loss incidence by gender. The strongest independent predictors of unintentional weight loss were age, smoking, and poor self-reported health. In another United States survey including over 5000 participants age &ge;50 years, 7 percent of the sample reported unintentional weight loss of 5 percent or more over six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Prevalence increased with age and was also higher among those with obesity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88396401\"><span class=\"h1\">MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mortality rates appear to be increased when weight loss is unintentional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a study of over 10,000 adult Israeli men working in the civil service, those who were not dieting but nevertheless lost at least 5 kg over 5 years had an 18 percent increase in total mortality over the next 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The excess mortality was almost entirely explained by increased cardiovascular deaths, even after adjusting for age, baseline cardiovascular risk factors, baseline body mass index (BMI), and other comorbidities. Cancer mortality was not different between those who lost weight and those who did not. In the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II Mortality Study, unintentional weight loss was associated with a 24 percent relative increase in mortality during the follow-up period, even among those with obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The study included over 5000 participants aged &ge;50 years who were followed for at least 12 years.</p><p>Mortality rates may be higher for other specific populations with weight loss. For example, weight loss among nursing home residents predicts increased mortality, regardless of underlying diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. Patients with advanced lung disease and heart failure with weight loss also have increased mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional support in advanced lung disease&quot;, section on 'Effect of cachexia on mortality and lung function'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction#H35\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predictors of survival in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Weight loss and BMI'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88396422\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many causes of unintentional weight loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F106883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106883 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62358\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62358 \">table 2</a>). In the absence of fever or other cause for increased energy expenditure (eg, hyperthyroidism), weight loss is predominantly due to decreased food intake.</p><p>Progressive unintentional weight loss often indicates serious medical or psychiatric illness. Any chronic illness affecting any organ system can cause anorexia and weight loss. In studies that examined the etiologies for unintentional weight loss, malignancy is eventually identified as the primary cause in 15 to 37 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/15,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17-20</a>]. Non-malignant gastrointestinal causes account for 10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/17,18,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,21,22</a>]. Psychiatric causes occur in 10 to 23 percent of community-dwelling participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/17,18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,20</a>].

There are multiple mechanisms accounting for weight loss in patients with cancer. Anorexia and weight loss are present in 15 to 40 percent of all cancer patients at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>],<strong> </strong>but the prevalence appears to be highest in those diagnosed<strong> </strong>with lung cancer (60 percent) or upper gastrointestinal cancer (80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Cancer cachexia involves complex metabolic abnormalities that decrease muscle mass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and assessment of cancer cachexia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with malignancy as a cause of weight loss often have one or more abnormalities noted during the initial diagnostic evaluation. For example, patients may have pain, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, early satiety due to hepatosplenic enlargement or malignant obstruction, hypercalcemia, or symptoms of malabsorption. (See <a href=\"#H88396550\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>A prospective study of unintentional weight loss in the United States found that occult malignancy is very unusual, with only 1 of 59 patients diagnosed with cancer over an extended follow-up after an initial negative evaluation for weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Similarly, a Spanish prospective cohort study found that only 5 percent of patients (19 of 375) with unintentional weight loss and a negative initial evaluation were diagnosed with cancer over a 65-month follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, in a prospective cohort study of 101 patients, all 22 patients with malignancy had an abnormal laboratory test, with C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, and albumin having the highest sensitivities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Abnormal abdominal ultrasound and chest radiograph had lower sensitivities, 45 and 18 percent, respectively.<strong> </strong>However, all of these diagnostic tests were also abnormal, but to a lesser extent, among patients with non-malignant organic disease. Thus, there is no general diagnostic test or group of tests that appears to be specific for malignancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3548860158\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous nonmalignant gastrointestinal etiologies can cause weight loss. Examples include peptic ulcer disease, diseases that cause malabsorption (eg, celiac disease), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><p>Patients with weight loss from gastrointestinal causes will often have associated gastrointestinal symptoms including: anorexia, abdominal pain, early satiety, dysphagia, odynophagia, diarrhea, steatorrhea, or evidence of chronic bleeding. They may also have signs and symptoms associated with chronic inflammation, chronic ischemia, obstruction, or fistulas. Patients with IBD may have extraintestinal manifestations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81867\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81867 \">table 3</a>). Patients with malabsorption may have weight loss with increased or normal appetite (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76166 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1264802523\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychiatric disorders commonly cause weight loss. A prospective cohort study of 2677 patients with unintended weight loss found that 14 percent were the result of psychiatric disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among nursing home patients, psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, account for 31 to 58 percent of cases of unintentional weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/11,15,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15,27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Depression</strong> &ndash; The independent role of depression in weight loss is difficult to determine due to the frequency of overlapping causes, such as social isolation, physical disabilities, dementia, dysphagia, <span class=\"nowrap\">medication/drug</span> use, and multiple chronic diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and neurobiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Eating disorders</strong> &ndash; In patients who are of normal weight or underweight, obsession with being overweight leads to weight loss as a result of decreased food intake, excessive exercise, self-induced vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">drug/herbal</span> medication use, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> behaviors suggestive of <span class=\"nowrap\">bulimia/anorexia</span> nervosa.

During the manic phases of bipolar disorder, hyperactivity and preoccupations may interfere with normal eating patterns. In rare circumstances, patients with delusions or paranoia may develop peculiar ideations about food that lead to decreased food intake and subsequent weight loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features#H2272752\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Major depression'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and initial management of psychosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88396437\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrinopathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight loss is a common feature of endocrinopathies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperthyroidism</strong> &ndash; Weight loss is a classic symptom of hyperthyroidism. Most patients have hyperphagia. Some younger patients with mild hyperthyroidism eat enough to actually gain weight. In older patients, however, hyperthyroidism often causes anorexia with accelerated weight loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diabetes mellitus</strong> &ndash; Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can cause weight loss with increased appetite, particularly with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although patients with poorly controlled or undiagnosed type 2 diabetes can occasionally present with weight loss, weight gain is much more common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, presentation, and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults#H2386084\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, some patients with type 2 diabetes can occasionally present with diabetic neuropathic cachexia, an unusual and poorly understood syndrome characterized by profound weight loss (as much as 60 percent of body weight) and often severe neuropathic pain of the anterior thighs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

Adrenal insufficiency that is acute or due to hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction is usually not associated with weight loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pheochromocytoma</strong> &ndash; The hyperadrenergic state among patients with pheochromocytoma would theoretically cause weight loss with increased appetite, but only 5 percent of patients with pheochromocytomas report weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Weight loss in patients with HIV infection is usually episodic, occurring with secondary infections or gastrointestinal diseases, and leads to a reduction in energy intake. The lethargy and fatigue that accompany infection may help maintain energy balance and weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tuberculosis</strong> &ndash; Many patients with active tuberculosis experience weight loss. For reactivation tuberculosis, significant weight loss is one of the cardinal signs and symptoms.

The fluid retention associated with chronic heart failure often masks the extensive loss of lean body mass.

Progressive weight loss can occur even with adequate caloric intake due to increased respiratory muscle work and possibly systemic inflammation. Often the weight loss is episodic, associated with exacerbations of lung disease, but without any regain in weight after recovery. Glucocorticoid treatment, systemic inflammation, and immobility contribute to the loss of muscle mass in severe lung disease.

The evaluation should start with verifying the weight loss, then a careful history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F107034\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107034 \">algorithm 1</a>). Many patients complain of weight loss but do not have documented weight loss. The workup of a patient with unintentional weight loss should be individualized, based on findings from the patient's history and physical examination.</p><p>Patients with &lt;5 percent loss of usual body weight can be closely followed; the interval of follow-up may vary depending on the patient&rsquo;s age and comorbidities.</p><p>In patients with documented weight loss of &ge;5 percent of usual body weight and positive findings on history or physical examination, further testing should be focused on confirming the suspected diagnosis.

Therefore, in documenting weight loss, it is important to obtain previous weight records and, if not available, to query family members about the patient's weight history, including usual weight prior to the period of weight loss. Unintentional weight loss exceeding 20 percent of usual weight is often associated with severe protein-energy malnutrition, nutritional deficiencies, and multiorgan dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pattern of weight loss</strong> &ndash; It is important to determine the duration and pattern of weight loss, including past fluctuations in weight and whether weight loss is progressive or stabilized. Recent weight loss in a person whose weight has been stable for many years and weight loss that is progressive are more worrisome and require more immediate follow-up. Other factors to consider include changes in appetite, caloric intake, and physical activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluation for eating disorders and intentional weight loss</strong> &ndash; Clinicians should question patients regarding possible intentional weight loss (eg, dieting in an obese patient).

The evaluation should start with verifying the weight loss followed by a careful history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F107034\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107034 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Patients with history or physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76166 \">table 4</a>) concerning for malabsorption should be evaluated appropriately.
