If a remission is achieved, the patient can be transitioned to a maintenance regimen, typically involving medications with a slower onset of action and fewer side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65046\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65046 \">table 1</a>). The selection of drugs for induction and maintenance depend on age, disease severity, location, and clinical course. In general, very young children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are more likely to have severe or refractory disease, and to have an identifiable genetic cause of the disease (monogenic IBD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children#H216504648\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;, section on 'Early onset IBD'</a>.)</p><p>Specific recommendations based on the severity and location of a patient's disease and his or her response to treatment are discussed below. (see <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Choice of treatment'</a> below). Resources for patient education and decision aids are available through the <a href=\"http://www.naspghan.org/content/53/en/Inflammatory-Bowel-Disease&amp;token=gdEMl/3RV4q6xsBHuH4h8lnEAxvaoZ2OaJ3JkDKI3ykCWeceAEZk6NPK3FBr5ZUEDETO31l/4gYrRQvxDbcfW0SSBjGhCSi9V8P/EzmF0n8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5866\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NASPGHAN Foundation website</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The ideal goal of treatment is clinical and laboratory remission with mucosal healing, not just symptomatic improvement. However, achieving this goal must be balanced against the risks of IBD therapies. Patients who achieve clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic remission may have better long-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Optimal care therefore typically includes one of the following approaches:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accelerated &quot;step-up&quot; therapy for most patients &ndash; Initiate treatment with the least potent drug predicted to be effective, promptly step up therapy to more potent drug if response is incomplete.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Top down&quot; therapy for selected high-risk patients &ndash; Early treatment with a highly potent immunosuppressant (eg, anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody) for patients with high risks of complicated disease. (See <a href=\"#H1252944860\" class=\"local\">'Early use of infliximab or adalimumab'</a> below.) </p><p/><p>With either of these approaches, a &quot;treat-to-target&quot; approach is increasingly used, in which objective assessments (including follow-up MRI imaging, upper endoscopy, or colonoscopy) are utilized to monitor disease course and guide treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. This is because the correlation between clinical symptoms, laboratory values, and endoscopic healing is poor. Patients who feel well may still have endoscopic or radiologic evidence of inflammation, which may put them at increased risk of future exacerbations or the development of complications (stricture, fistula, abscess). In addition to close monitoring for drug efficacy, the clinician must also monitor for drug toxicities and medication adherence. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The response to therapy is based upon the clinician's evaluation of clinical disease activity and supporting laboratory data, assessed during clinical visits approximately every three to four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1252945866\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should monitor clinical symptoms including diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia, growth failure, fatigue, extraintestinal symptoms, school attendance, and psychological stress (eg, anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression). The examination evaluates for signs of abdominal, perianal, dermatologic, and rheumatologic illness. Weight and height are measured at each visit, and the interval height velocity is calculated. Screening and assessing children for growth failure is an essential component of medical care and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth failure and poor weight gain in children with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For clinical care, disease severity usually is determined by the clinician's global assessment, which is not standardized. The following are <strong>examples</strong> of a typical patient in each category, but are not prescriptive:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild &ndash; Patient has mild, brief episodes of abdominal pain and loose stools (with or without small amounts of visible blood), little or no anemia, and no weight loss or growth delay. There is no abdominal tenderness on examination. Endoscopy and imaging demonstrate either limited disease (eg, terminal ileitis), or mild disease (eg, a few aphthae in the colon). Biopsies may demonstrate patchy inflammatory infiltrates in the colon. Extraintestinal manifestations usually are not present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate &ndash; Patient has frequent episodes of abdominal pain that interfere with activities and five or more loose stools daily (with or without visible blood). Weight and height gain are less than expected for age, or as compared with the patient's previous trajectory. Patients may have mild or moderate anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, and a somewhat tender abdomen on examination. Radiography and endoscopy demonstrate more extensive or severe disease (eg, ulcers throughout the colon, more extensive ileal involvement, or upper tract involvement. Extraintestinal manifestations [erythema nodosum, uveitis] may be present).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe &ndash; Patient has frequent abdominal pain and liquid stools, including at night. There is marked abdominal tenderness, with guarding or a mass. A history of weight loss is common, and body mass index is often &lt;10 percentile. There is moderate or severe anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypoalbuminemia, malnutrition, and definite growth failure. Deep fissuring ulcers and longitudinal ulcers may be seen throughout the ileum and colon. Extensive small bowel disease (Paris Classification L4b) may be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89025\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89025 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89028\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89028 \">table 2</a>). </p><p/><p>The presence of perianal fistulas or extraintestinal manifestations of IBD (eg, arthritis, fever, uveitis, erythema nodosum) increase the severity assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H828643565\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laboratory assessment usually includes a complete blood count (CBC), serum albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and liver aminotransferases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]). There is some evidence that fecal calprotectin levels are correlated with disease activity and can be a useful adjunct to the clinical and laboratory evaluation of the patient, if this test is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children#H184210643\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;, section on 'Laboratory features'</a>.) </p><p>Additional testing depends on the clinical course of the patient. In some patients, particularly those with active disease or on prolonged glucocorticoid therapy, we measure vitamin D, vitamin B12, and zinc levels, and assess skeletal health using bone densitometry periodically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66288\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66288 \">table 3</a>). If ALT and AST are elevated, we check gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) to assess for the unusual complication of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); some providers monitor GGTP routinely, along with ALT and AST. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Important health maintenance issues for children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H828643571\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the clinical assessment suggests persistent disease activity, repeat radiographic and endoscopic assessment should be considered. Increasingly, repeat imaging (with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]; specifically magnetic resonance enterography [MRE]) and reassessment with colonoscopy are being performed even in the absence of clinical symptoms because data from trials suggest that clinical remission is not necessarily accompanied by endoscopic remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Indications for and selection among the endoscopic and imaging options is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children#H20369433\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>For patients presenting with a flare of colitis, we screen for bacterial causes of colitis, with stool cultures and testing for <em>Clostridium difficile </em>toxin; for those with refractory colitis, we also evaluate for infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children#H8243939\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;, section on 'Stool testing for enteric pathogens'</a>.) </p><p>For patients with extensive CD of the colon, we begin surveillance colonoscopy approximately 7 to 10 years after the diagnosis of IBD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H20631858\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Important health maintenance issues for children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Surveillance for cancer'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H828643533\"><span class=\"h3\">Scoring disease activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease activity may be quantified using a pediatric CD activity index (PCDAI); this system is primarily used for clinical trials but also may be useful for routine evaluation of hospitalized patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100489\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100489 \">table 4</a>). The PCDAI permits the calculation of a numerical score ranging from 0 to 100 based upon a child's well-being, degree of abdominal pain, bowel movements, weight gain, linear growth, physical examination, hematocrit, sedimentation rate, and serum albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. A score of 0 to 10 denotes inactive disease, 11 to 30 mild disease activity, and over 30 moderate to severe disease activity. A decrease in PCDAI of &ge;12.5 reflects a clinical response (improvement from <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate/severe</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">mild/inactive</span> disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Endoscopic monitoring of disease activity is increasingly used to assess response to therapy, ideally using a scoring system to quantify the findings. Studies in adults support the use of the simple endoscopic score for CD (SES-CD), which is accurate and easier to use than other endoscopic activity assessments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This index has not been formally validated in pediatric patients.</p><p>The United States Food and Drug administration (FDA) has recommended that patient reported outcomes (ie, questions answered by the patients themselves rather than their physicians) be utilized in future drug trials for adult and pediatric IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. For pediatric CD, these include general and disease-specific quality-of-life measures, including PedsQL and the IMPACT-35 quality of life scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INDUCTION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For CD affecting the ileum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> colon, a variety of medications are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65046\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65046 \">table 1</a>). The choice of medication typically depends on disease location, severity, and response. The properties of the medications are discussed in this section. An algorithmic approach to treatment is discussed later in this topic review. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Choice of treatment'</a> below.) </p><p>Practice varies with regard to the use of glucocorticoids (corticosteroids) as initial therapy for patients with moderate to severe CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In the United States, glucocorticoids remain the primary initial medical treatment for the acute therapy. In contrast, in other countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom, patients with small bowel involvement are often treated with an elemental (eg, Vivonex) or polymeric diet (eg, Ensure) rather than glucocorticoids for induction of remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1252944020\" class=\"local\">'Exclusive enteral nutrition'</a> below). Biologics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">adalimumab</a>, are sometimes used for initial medical treatment of high-risk patients with severe disease. (See <a href=\"#H1252944860\" class=\"local\">'Early use of infliximab or adalimumab'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70969672\"><span class=\"h2\">Aminosalicylates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aminosalicylates are often used for induction in patients with mild disease and are continued in these patients for maintenance of remission. However, no formal trials have assessed the efficacy of these agents for induction in mild CD. The use of aminosalicylates for CD is controversial, with some meta-analyses suggesting lack of efficacy, while others suggesting moderate effectiveness in colonic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nevertheless, many clinicians continue to use aminosalicylates for mild CD, due to a paucity of information on how to treat this condition. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Aminosalicylates'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, glucocorticoids remain a common initial medical treatment for the acute therapy of moderate to severe CD. Glucocorticoids are considered short-term induction therapies. Ideally, a course of corticosteroid therapy should serve as a &quot;bridge&quot; to a long-term maintenance treatment (usually an immunomodulator or biologic).</p><p>Intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> provides the most rapid glucocorticoid effect and is appropriate for patients with severe disease at presentation. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">budesonide</a> can be used for patients with mild or moderate disease. Budesonide is probably less effective than prednisone, but also has fewer side effects. The efficacy of budesonide is limited to the ileum and ascending colon. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10321478\"><span class=\"h3\">Methylprednisolone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with severe disease at presentation, glucocorticoids are given intravenously initially (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a>, typically given as 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose every 12 hours, up to a maximum of 30 mg every 12 hours), then transitioned to oral forms if the patient demonstrates a good clinical response. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Prednisone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with active mucosal inflammation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a> given orally at a dose of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (maximum 60 mg daily) brings rapid improvement in most patients. Once remission is achieved, glucocorticoids can be tapered. Although glucocorticoids are effective for inducing remission in most patients, many become glucocorticoid-dependent or require surgery. This was illustrated in a review that described the natural history of CD from 1970 to 1993, a period when glucocorticoids were the most effective available medical therapy for CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although 80 percent of patients were in remission after 30 days, after 12 months, 28 percent were still glucocorticoid-dependent and 38 percent had undergone surgery. </p><p>Like other glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a> also are associated with many long-term side effects, including growth failure, osteopenia, hirsutism, diabetes, psychosis, cataracts, and altered body shape and image. Furthermore, they are not effective for maintaining remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, prednisone or prednisolone should serve as a short-term induction therapy and as a bridge to a more effective maintenance therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Budesonide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteric-coated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">budesonide</a>, designed for release in the ileum and cecum, is an alternative to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>. Budesonide has local effects on the bowel but has a high first-pass hepatic metabolism; thus, systemic effect is decreased. The efficacy of budesonide is limited to the ileum and ascending colon (right colon).</p><p>The initial starting dose for an adolescent or adult is 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> tapered by 3 mg increments. There are few data on the optimal dosing in children. The adult dose of 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> has been used in clinical trials in children six years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. A retrospective study of 62 children used oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">budesonide</a> in doses of 0.45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (maximum dose 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for the treatment of mild to moderate CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Studies in adults suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">budesonide</a> was slightly less effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> in inducing remission in active disease but was associated with fewer side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Budesonide in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similar conclusions were reached in a controlled trial in children, which included 48 patients who were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">budesonide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The proportion of patients achieving remission at two months was lower in the budesonide group, but the difference was not statistically significant (55 versus 71 percent). However, patients in the budesonide group had significantly fewer side effects (eg, moon face, acne) and less adrenal suppression.

Although no large studies have been done in children, budesonide has not been consistently effective for maintaining remission in adults.

This suggestion is based on knowledge of the established adverse effects of glucocorticoids, particularly on bone density, and on the evidence that EEN is moderately effective for inducing remission and mucosal healing.

However, there is limited evidence to guide patient selection for this approach. These drugs have rapid onset of action and can be used as the initial induction medication, or shortly after induction with corticosteroids. The choice between infliximab and adalimumab depends on clinician and patient preferences, such as a preference for subcutaneous administration (adalimumab) versus infusions (infliximab). A plain-language summary to guide discussions about treatment decisions is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107130\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107130 \">table 5</a>). Details about the use of infliximab and adalimumab, including dosing, efficacy, safety, and decisions about use in combination with other immunosuppressive medications, are discussed below.

The groups were matched by a &quot;propensity score,&quot; which effectively narrowed the comparison to subjects with relatively high risks for complicated disease. After one year, remission was achieved in 85.3 percent of the children treated with an anti-TNF antibody, versus 60.3 percent of those treated with an immunomodulator, and 54.4 percent of those managed without immunotherapy. Early treatment with an anti-TNF antibody was also associated with lower use of corticosteroids and a modest improvement in linear growth compared with the other treatment groups.</p><p>It is unclear whether early use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a> or other anti-TNF antibodies is beneficial in patients without high-risk characteristics.

Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether the potential benefits of using infliximab early in the course of CD outweigh the risks. An important concern is that early use of infliximab may lead to loss of response, due to development of antibodies to infliximab.

To determine a safe starting dose, we suggest evaluating patients for the thiopurine methyltransferase genotype (TPMT genotype) or phenotype (TPMT activity) prior to beginning treatment with 6-MP or AZA. TPMT is an enzyme that is essential in the metabolism of thiopurines. Approximately 90 percent of patients are homozygous for the allele TPMT 1 (ie, TPMT <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1</span> genotype) and have normal or rapid metabolism of thiopurines.

Approximately 1 in 300 patients has absent TPMT activity (eg, TPMT <span class=\"nowrap\">3a/3a</span> genotype) and does not metabolize the medication.

Because HSTCL is otherwise extremely rare (approximately 100 cases have been reported in the literature), it is unlikely that these cases are due to chance alone. The thiopurine is thought to be the primary risk factor for HSTCL, both because some cases occurred on thiopurine monotherapy, and because thiopurines are known to raise the risk of lymphoma; anti-TNF monotherapy is less likely to be associated with lymphoma, although data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

Adalimumab is also used as a second-line treatment for patients who lose response to or are intolerant of infliximab. It is administered by subcutaneous injection every two weeks.

The benefits of infliximab include more extensive experience and the less frequent dosing in the maintenance phase (every eight weeks in contrast with every two weeks). The benefits of adalimumab are reduced cost (because no infusion center is needed) and the convenience of administering the medication at home or school.

Most of these subjects had failed a prior trial of infliximab because of loss of response, infusion reaction, or intolerance. The IMAgINE 1 trial evaluated two maintenance dosing regimens of adalimumab in 188 pediatric patients with moderate to severe CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>].

About 40 percent of patients had been previously treated with infliximab but had become unresponsive or had adverse reactions to that drug. The trial focused on the maintenance phase of adalimumab. A standard-dose group received 40 mg for body weight &ge;40 kg, or 20 mg for body weight &lt;40 kg; and a low dose group received 20 mg for body weight &ge;40 kg, or 10 mg for body weight &lt;40 kg. After 26 weeks of maintenance therapy during which these doses of adalimumab were given every two weeks, 33.5 percent of patients remained in clinical remission, and there was no significant difference between the two dosing regimens.

Important considerations are: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Potential risks</strong> &ndash; The main concern about combination therapy is that it might increase the risk of lymphoma as compared with monotherapy. Since large studies of IBD patients suggest that thiopurines confer a slight increase in lymphoma risk, it is logical to infer that thiopurine discontinuation might reduce that risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/70,76,151\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,76,151</a>].

In particular, we prefer MTX rather than thiopurines in young males, because young males seem to be at increased risk for HSTCL. However, the benefits of using MTX as an adjunct to anti-TNF therapy have not been established, since the only study that demonstrates that MTX reduces antibodies to infliximab utilized higher dose subcutaneous MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

In two large series of children with CD treated in North America from 2002 to 2008, the risk for CD-related bowel surgery was 1.4 percent at one year after diagnosis, 14 to 17 percent at five years, and 28 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/172,173\" class=\"abstract_t\">172,173</a>]. Prior to the widespread use of immunomodulators, considerably higher percentages of patients required surgery. As an example, in a series of children treated between 1968 and 1994, 46 percent of children required surgery for complications of CD, including growth retardation, bowel perforation, internal fistula, or hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/174\" class=\"abstract_t\">174</a>].

Surgery usually involves resection of the diseased bowel segment and primary end-to-end anastomosis. In some patients with multiple small bowel strictures, strictureplasty (widening of the strictured area in a manner similar to pyloroplasty) may reduce the need for bowel resection. In patients with extensive Crohn colitis, full colonic resection and end-ileostomy may be unavoidable. Postoperative complications, including infections, probably are not increased in patients treated with immunomodulators just prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/177,178\" class=\"abstract_t\">177,178</a>].

However, although a variety of dietary changes and supplements have been explored as adjuncts to treatment, none have been shown to be beneficial in maintaining remission.

Induction of remission with glucocorticoids or with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy is a reasonable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Aminosalicylates'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1252944020\" class=\"local\">'Exclusive enteral nutrition'</a> above.)</p><p>Once remission is induced, the patient is transitioned to maintenance therapy with aminosalicylates alone or a thiopurine (6-mercaptopurine [6-MP] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">azathioprine</a> [AZA]). Aminosalicylates are less effective but have lower toxicity as compared with thiopurines. As a result, we generally attempt maintenance with aminosalicylates before considering thiopurine therapy for patients with mild disease (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Aminosalicylates'</a> above). By contrast, patients with recurrent flares requiring glucocorticoid treatment (eg, two or more flares in a 12-month period) are likely to benefit from thiopurine therapy to reduce glucocorticoid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

EEN is an appropriate alternative to glucocorticoids, especially for patients with growth failure; this approach is frequently used as an induction regimen in the United Kingdom and in parts of Europe and Canada.

Instead, practice is trending toward use of MTX for maintenance therapy, or early use of anti-TNF antibodies. Aminosalicylates may be considered for patients who are strongly opposed to immunosuppression, but it is unclear if these drugs are superior to placebo in preventing relapse (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Aminosalicylates'</a> above).
