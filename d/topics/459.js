The Paris Academy of Science recommended mouth-to-mouth ventilation for drowning victims in 1740 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 1891, Dr. Friedrich Maass performed the first documented chest compressions on humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The American Heart Association (AHA) formally endorsed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in 1963, and by 1966, they had adopted standardized CPR guidelines for instruction to lay-rescuers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) guidelines have evolved over the past several decades based on a combination of scientific evidence of variable strength and expert consensus. The American Heart Association (AHA) and European Resuscitation Council developed the most recent ACLS guidelines in 2010 using the comprehensive review of resuscitation literature performed by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR), and these were updated in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/4-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-11</a>]. Guidelines are reviewed continually but are formally released every five years, and published in the journals Circulation and Resuscitation.</p><p>This topic will discuss the management of cardiac arrhythmias in adults as generally described in the most recent iteration of the ACLS Guidelines. Where our suggestions differ or expand upon the published guidelines, we state this explicitly. The evidence supporting the published guidelines is presented separately, as are issues related to controversial treatments for cardiac arrest patients, basic life support (BLS), airway management, and post-cardiac arrest management.

Many of the recommendations in the American Heart Association and the European Resuscitation Council's 2010 Guidelines for advanced cardiac life support and the 2015 update (hereafter referred to as the ACLS Guidelines) are made based upon retrospective studies, animal studies, and expert consensus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/4-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-11</a>]. Guideline recommendations are classified according to the GRADE system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The evidence supporting the ACLS Guidelines is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supportive data for advanced cardiac life support in adults with sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Excellent basic life support and its importance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excellent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation for treatable arrhythmias remain the cornerstones of basic and ACLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Although the 2015 update for the American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for ACLS (ACLS Guidelines) suggest several revisions, including medications and monitoring, the emphasis on excellent CPR and its critical role in resuscitative efforts remains unchanged (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55548\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55548 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73862\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73862 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. We emphasize the term &quot;excellent CPR&quot; because anything short of this standard does not achieve adequate cerebral and coronary perfusion, thereby compromising a patient's chances for neurologically intact survival. CPR is discussed in detail separately; key principles in the performance of ACLS are summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83671\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83671 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-life-support-bls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic life support (BLS) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the past, clinicians frequently interrupted CPR to check for pulses, perform tracheal intubation, or obtain venous access. Current ACLS Guidelines strongly recommend that every effort be made <strong>NOT</strong> to interrupt CPR; other less vital interventions (eg, tracheal intubation or administration of medications to treat arrhythmias) are made either while CPR is performed or, if a required intervention cannot be performed while CPR is in progress, during the briefest possible addition to the 2 minute rhythm check (after the completion of a full cycle of CPR).</p><p>Studies in both the in-hospital and prehospital settings demonstrate that chest compressions are often performed incorrectly, inconsistently, and with excessive interruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Chest compressions must be of sufficient depth (5 to 6 cm, or 2 to 2.5 inches) and rate (between 100 and 120 per minute), and allow for complete recoil of the chest between compressions, to be effective.</p><p>A single biphasic defibrillation remains the recommended treatment for ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT). CPR should be performed until the defibrillator is ready for immediate discharge and resumed immediately after the shock is given, without pausing to recheck a pulse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Interruptions in CPR (eg, for subsequent attempts at defibrillation or pulse checks) should occur no more frequently than every 2 minutes, and for the shortest possible duration. Key elements in the performance of manual defibrillation are described in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83670\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83670 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Patients are often over-ventilated during resuscitations, which can compromise venous return resulting in reduced cardiac output and inadequate cerebral and cardiac perfusion. A 30:2 compression to ventilation ratio (one cycle) is recommended in patients without advanced airways. According to the ACLS Guidelines, asynchronous ventilations at 8 to 10 per minute are administered if an endotracheal tube or extraglottic airway is in place, while continuous chest compressions are performed simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. We believe that 6 to 8 ventilations per minute are sufficient in the low-flow state of cardiac arrest and help to prevent excessive intrathoracic pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Resuscitation team management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The resuscitation of a sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), by its nature a low frequency, high acuity event, is often chaotic. A growing body of literature demonstrates that by employing the principles of Crisis Resource Management (CRM), adapted from the aviation industry and introduced into medical care by anesthesiologists, disorganization during resuscitation decreases and patient care improves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. A primary goal of CRM is to access the collective knowledge and experience of the entire team in order to provide the best care possible and to compensate for oversights or other problems that any individual is likely to experience during such stressful events. Training in these principles to improve the quality of ACLS performed by healthcare clinicians is feasible and recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Two principles provide the foundation for CRM: leadership and communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Resuscitations usually involve a number of healthcare providers from different disciplines, sometimes from different areas of an institution, who may not have worked together previously. Under these circumstances, role clarity can be difficult to establish. In CRM, it is imperative that one person assumes the role of team leader [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This person is responsible for the global management of the resuscitation, including: ensuring that all required tasks are carried out competently; incorporating new information and coordinating communication among all team members; developing and implementing management strategies that will maximize patient outcome; and reassessing performance throughout the resuscitation.</p><p>The team leader should avoid performing technical procedures, as performance of a task inevitably shifts attention from the primary leadership responsibilities. In circumstances where staffing is limited (eg, small community hospital), the team leader may be required to perform certain critical procedures. In these situations, leadership may be temporarily transferred to another clinician or the team leader may be forced temporarily to perform both roles, although this compromises the ability to provide proficient leadership.</p><p>In CRM, communication is organized to provide effective and efficient care. All pertinent communication goes through the team leader and the team leader shares important information with the team. When the team leader determines the need to perform a task, the request is directed to a specific team member, ideally by name. That team member verbally acknowledges the request and performs the task or, if unable to do so, informs the team leader that someone else should be assigned. Specific emphasis is placed on the assigned team member repeating back medication doses and defibrillator energy settings to the team leader. This &quot;closed-loop&quot; communication leads to a more orderly transfer of information and is the appropriate standard for all communication during resuscitations.</p><p>Though most decisions emanate from the team leader, a good team leader enlists the collective wisdom and experience of the entire team as needed. Team members must be encouraged to speak up if they have a concern or a feasible suggestion. Efforts should be made to overcome the tendency to withhold potentially life-saving suggestions due to the fear of being incorrect or the nature of hierarchies that exist in many healthcare institutions. Extraneous personnel not directly involved with patient care are asked to leave in order to reduce noise and to ensure that orders from the leader and feedback from the resuscitation team can be heard clearly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial management and ECG interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 2010 ACLS Guidelines, circulation assumed a more prominent role in the initial management of cardiac arrest and this approach continues in the 2015 update. The &quot;mantra&quot; is: circulation, airway, breathing (C-A-B). Once unresponsiveness is recognized, resuscitation begins by addressing circulation (chest compressions), followed by airway opening, and then rescue breathing. The ACLS Guidelines emphasize the importance of excellently performed, uninterrupted chest compressions and early defibrillation. Rescue breathing is performed after the initiation of excellent chest compressions and definitive airway management may be delayed if there is adequate rescue breathing without an advanced airway in place. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Excellent basic life support and its importance'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-life-support-bls-in-adults#H2399946\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic life support (BLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Recognition of cardiac arrest'</a>.)</p><p>In the non-cardiac arrest situation, the other initial interventions for ACLS include administering oxygen (if the patient&rsquo;s oxygen saturation is below 94 percent), establishing vascular access, placing the patient on a cardiac and oxygen saturation monitor, and obtaining an electrocardiogram (ECG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/5,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,10</a>]. Unstable patients must receive immediate care, even when data are incomplete or presumptive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55548\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55548 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73862\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73862 \">algorithm 2</a>). Patients with clear evidence of STEMI on ECG should be prepared for rapid transfer to the catheterization laboratory, receive a thrombolytic (if not contraindicated), or be transferred to a center with PCI capabilities. These decisions are made based on local resources and protocols. </p><p>Stable patients require an assessment of their electrocardiogram in order to provide appropriate treatment consistent with ACLS guidelines. Although it is best to make a definitive interpretation of the ECG prior to making management decisions, the settings in which ACLS guidelines are commonly employed require a modified, empirical approach. Such an approach is guided by the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the rhythm fast or slow?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are the QRS complexes wide or narrow?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the rhythm regular or irregular?</p><p/><p>The answers to these questions often enable the clinician to make a provisional diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4318336\"><span class=\"h1\">AIRWAY MANAGEMENT WHILE PERFORMING ACLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventilation is performed during CPR to maintain adequate oxygenation. The elimination of carbon dioxide is less important, and normalization of pH through hyperventilation is both dangerous and unattainable until there is return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). However, during the first few minutes following sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), oxygen delivery to the brain is limited primarily by reduced blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Therefore, in adults, the performance of excellent chest compressions takes priority over ventilation during the initial period of basic life support. In settings with multiple rescuers or clinicians, ventilations and chest compressions are performed simultaneously.</p><p>The ventilation rate is determined by whether the patient is intubated. If the patient is not intubated but ventilated using a bag and mask (our preferred approach), the compression to ventilation ratio is 30:2. Although rescuers may be tempted to deliver non-synchronized bag mask ventilations during CPR to minimize interruptions in compressions, the mechanics of mask ventilations make it impossible to deliver adequate tidal volume during an active compression. If the patient is intubated, we suggest performing no more than six non-synchronized ventilations per minute. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-life-support-bls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic life support (BLS) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although research has yet to identify the preferred parameters for ventilation (eg, respiratory rate, tidal volume, inspired oxygen concentration), it is widely believed that a lower minute ventilation is needed for patients in cardiac arrest. Therefore, lower respiratory rates are used (the ACLS Guidelines recommend 10 breaths per minute with an advanced airway in place; we believe 6 breaths are adequate). In addition, we know that hyperventilation is harmful, as it leads to increased intrathoracic pressure, which decreases venous return and compromises cardiac output. Tidal volumes of approximately 600 mL delivered in a controlled fashion such that chest rise occurs over no more than one second is recommended in the ACLS Guidelines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-life-support-bls-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic life support (BLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Ventilations'</a>.)</p><p>Taking these principles into account, the ACLS Guidelines support the use of a bag-mask device or a blindly placed supraglottic airway for ventilation during the initial management of SCA, deferring placement of an endotracheal tube, unless intubation can be competently performed without interrupting chest compressions or one cannot ventilate the patient by other less invasive means. We concur with this general approach but prefer bag-mask ventilation (BMV) during CPR. When BMV is ineffective or circumstances make it difficult or impossible to perform (eg, patient transport), we suggest that ventilation be performed using a supraglottic airway. If this is not possible, endotracheal intubation may be performed, but we prefer to intubate patients after the ROSC. The performance of BMV is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A blindly inserted supraglottic airway (eg, laryngeal mask airway, Combitube, laryngeal tube) can be placed without interrupting chest compressions, provides adequate ventilation in most cases, and reduces the risk of aspiration compared to bag-mask ventilation. Therefore, some clinicians may prefer to ventilate with a supraglottic device while CPR is ongoing, and this is a reasonable approach. Supraglottic airways and tracheal intubation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults#H250393374\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraglottic devices for emergency airway management in adults&quot;, section on 'Extraglottic airway devices'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If advanced airway management is to be performed in cardiac arrest patients, it must be done by competent providers, require less than 10 seconds to complete without interruption of excellent chest compressions, and be used only after all other more essential resuscitative maneuvers have been initiated. Once performed, rescuers must avoid hyperventilation, as this may result in increased intrathoracic pressure and decreased cardiac output. In addition, unless adequate BMV cannot be performed, placement of an advanced airway should be attempted only during active chest compressions or deferred to the 2 minute interval (after a complete cycle of CPR) when defibrillation or patient reassessment is performed.</p><p>The ACLS Guidelines include the following additional recommendations about airway management during the performance of ACLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although evidence is lacking, it is reasonable to provide 100 percent oxygen during CPR. In patients who are successfully resuscitated (ie, spontaneous circulation returns), it is important to avoid hyperoxia while maintaining oxygen saturation above 94 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults#H733416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-cardiac arrest management in adults&quot;, section on 'Mechanical ventilation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cricoid pressure is controversial and is no longer routinely recommended during intubation.

If waveform capnography is not available, a non-waveform CO<sub>2</sub> detector may be used, in addition to clinical assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;, section on 'Clinical applications for intubated patients'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The results of two large observational studies suggest that advanced airway management is not the best approach for managing patients with SCA: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective nationwide Japanese study involving 649,359 patients with sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the rate of survival with a favorable neurologic outcome was significantly lower among those managed with advanced airway techniques compared with bag-mask ventilation (1.1 versus 2.9 percent; odds ratio [OR] 0.38, 95% CI 0.36-0.39) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Higher rates of survival with a favorable neurologic outcome when using bag-mask ventilation persisted across all analyzed subgroups, including adjustments for initial rhythm, return of spontaneous circulation, bystander CPR, and additional treatments. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study drawing on data collected between 2000 and 2014 from a multicenter registry based in the United States used a propensity-matched cohort to compare outcomes among intubated and non-intubated patients who sustained SCA while in-patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In this study, each of 43,314 patients intubated during the first 15 minutes of presentation following SCA were matched with patients not intubated in the same minute. Rates of ROSC (57.8 versus 59.3 percent), survival (16.3 versus 19.4 percent), and survival with good functional outcome (10.6 versus 13.6 percent) were all lower among intubated patients, and this held true across all prespecified subgroup analyses.</p><p/><p>Although both these studies have limitations due to their observational nature and may not be generalizable to all settings, their size and consistent findings across all subgroup analyses support their conclusions. </p><p>Other evidence supporting a more basic approach to airway management during resuscitation of cardiac arrest includes a retrospective review of registry data involving 10,691 cardiac arrest patients, which reported that patients managed in the prehospital setting with bag-mask ventilation had significantly higher rates of neurologically intact survival to hospital discharge than patients managed with either a supraglottic airway or intubation (18.6 versus 5.2 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, randomized trials of airway management in the setting of cardiac arrest are lacking and some observational studies have reached different conclusions from the larger studies described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The optimal approach to airway management for victims of sudden cardiac arrest in the pre-hospital setting remains uncertain, but is likely bag-mask ventilation. In a randomized trial of bag-mask ventilation (1020 patients) versus endotracheal intubation (1023 patients) for pre-hospital management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in France or Belgium between 2015 and 2017, the primary outcome (survival with favorable neurologic outcome at 28 days) was similar in the two groups (4.3 percent with bag-mask ventilation compared with 4.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, the trial failed to meet the prespecified criteria for noninferiority, likely due to being underpowered. Additionally, ambulance teams in these countries include physicians with training in intubation, which is not common in many countries. Until additional data are available suggesting a clear improvement with outcomes from a particular ventilatory technique, bag-mask ventilation remains the preferred pre-hospital approach to airway management for cardiac arrest patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC ARRHYTHMIAS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3328729\"><span class=\"h2\">Sudden cardiac arrest</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) are non-perfusing rhythms emanating from the ventricles, for which early rhythm identification and defibrillation, are the mainstays of treatment.

Pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is defined as any one of a heterogeneous group of organized electrocardiographic rhythms without sufficient mechanical contraction of the heart to produce a palpable pulse or measurable blood pressure.

Asystole may be the result of a primary or secondary cardiac conduction abnormality, possibly from end-stage tissue hypoxia and metabolic acidosis, or, rarely, the result of excessive vagal stimulation. It is crucial to identify and treat potential secondary causes of asystole or PEA as rapidly as possible. Some causes (eg, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade) result in ineffective CPR. Do not hesitate to perform invasive procedures to treat suspected secondary causes; if the patient is receiving CPR, there is little chance the intervention will make the situation worse. The accompanying tables describe important secondary causes of cardiac arrest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52416 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>After initiating CPR, treat reversible causes as appropriate and administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (1 mg IV every 3 to 5 minutes). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vasopressin</a> was removed from the treatment algorithm in the 2015 update.

Assessment and immediate feedback about important clinical parameters, such as the rate and depth of chest compressions, adequacy of chest recoil between compressions, and rate and force of ventilations, can improve CPR. End-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) measurements from continuous waveform capnography (using nasal sampling if performing bag-mask ventilation (BMV) or tracheal tube sampling in intubated patients) accurately reflect cardiac output and cerebral perfusion pressure, and therefore the quality of CPR. Sudden, sustained increases in EtCO<sub>2</sub> during CPR indicate a ROSC while decreasing EtCO<sub>2</sub> during CPR may indicate inadequate compressions.

Measurements of arterial relaxation provide a reasonable approximation of coronary perfusion pressure.

At no point should excellent CPR be interrupted to obtain vascular access.</p><p>Doses for tracheal administration are 2 to 2.5 times the standard IV<sup> </sup>doses and medications should be diluted in 5 to 10 mL of sterile water or normal saline before injection down the tracheal tube. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-RESUSCITATION CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ACLS Guidelines recommend a combination of goal-oriented interventions provided by an experienced multidisciplinary team for all cardiac arrest patients with return of spontaneous circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults/abstract/8,11,14,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,14,50,51</a>].

EtCO<sub>2</sub> values are a function of CO<sub>2</sub> production and venous return to the right heart and pulmonary circulation.

It is crucial to note that low EtCO<sub>2</sub> levels may also be caused by a misplaced (esophageal) endotracheal tube, and this possibility needs to be excluded before the decision is made to terminate resuscitative efforts.

Of the 190 patients found to have cardiac wall motion, 98 (51.6 percent) achieved ROSC, whereas only 9 (2.4 percent) of the 378 without cardiac wall motion did so.
