Cholestasis results from diminished bile formation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excretion, which can be caused by a number of disorders. The term &quot;neonatal cholestasis&quot; is often used to refer to cholestatic liver disease that is present at birth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> develops within the first few months of life, rather than referring strictly to the neonatal period (the first 28 days of life). In clinical practice, these disorders usually become apparent within the first two months of life, which is the critical period for identifying infants with biliary atresia, the most common cause of cholestasis in this age group. However, similar diagnostic considerations apply for infants whose cholestasis is identified after two months of age.</p><p>Causes of neonatal cholestasis can be divided into the following categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64995 \">table 1A</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Metabolic/genetic</span> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alloimmune</p><p/><p>Although there are multiple causes of neonatal cholestasis, biliary atresia must be differentiated from other causes of cholestasis promptly because early surgical intervention (ie, before two months of age) results in a better patient outcome. Furthermore, other treatable disorders require prompt diagnosis to initiate effective therapy (eg, tyrosinemia, galactosemia, hypothyroidism, and infectious causes).</p><p>The most common causes of neonatal cholestasis will be reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79511\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79511 \">table 1B</a>). The approach to infants with neonatal cholestasis including differentiation between extrahepatic obstruction and intrahepatic disease is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to evaluation of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BILIARY ATRESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary atresia is a progressive idiopathic disease of the extrahepatic biliary tree that presents with clinical signs of biliary obstruction in young infants. Biliary atresia is the most common cause of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in young infants in resource-rich countries, accounting for about 20 to 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Biliary atresia must be recognized promptly because early surgical intervention (eg, before 60 days of age) substantially improves outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Even when optimally managed, many individuals with biliary atresia ultimately require liver transplantation.</p><p>Infants with biliary atresia tend to be healthy at birth and develop progressive jaundice within the first eight weeks of life. Other features include acholic (pale-colored) stools, and sometimes firm liver and splenomegaly. A minority of infants have associated congenital anomalies, including lateralization defects such as heterotaxy or asplenia. Laboratory tests reveal elevations in conjugated bilirubin, mild or moderate elevations in serum aminotransferases, and disproportionately elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP). </p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of biliary atresia are discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-atresia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary atresia&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER OBSTRUCTIVE CAUSES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Biliary cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary cysts are a rare but treatable cause of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. They were originally termed choledochal cysts because they usually involve the extrahepatic bile duct. Five anatomic variants have been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80937\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80937 \">figure 1</a>), but most affected infants have diffuse enlargement of the common bile duct (type 1, representing 50 to 80 percent of biliary cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In addition to jaundice, affected infants may have abdominal pain, an abdominal mass, and vomiting. Some infants in whom biliary cysts are diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound are asymptomatic during the neonatal period. </p><p>The cyst usually can be detected by ultrasonography and should be further evaluated by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraoperative cholangiopancreatography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Biliary cysts must be differentiated from cystic biliary atresia. In infants with biliary cysts, the intrahepatic bile ducts are normal or dilated rather than sclerosed, management is with resection rather than Kasai procedure, and the prognosis is better as compared with infants with biliary atresia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Ultrasonographic findings suggestive of biliary cysts rather than biliary atresia include larger cyst size, dilated intrahepatic bile ducts, and normal appearing gallbladder. </p><p>Management depends on the type of cyst and presence of biliary obstruction, but most cases presenting during the neonatal period will require surgical resection; removal of the cyst can prevent the development of ascending cholangitis or biliary adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A randomized trial showed that fibrotic liver disease is likely to develop even in asymptomatic infants, and that early surgical intervention (&le;1 month of age) is beneficial compared with late (&ge;1 month of age) intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients with biliary cysts may be at risk for later development of cholangiocarcinoma even after resection and should be monitored periodically with imaging and bloodwork.

Common congenitally acquired pathogens include cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, rubella, herpes, and syphilis. Less frequent causes are echovirus, adenovirus, and parvovirus B19. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-torch-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of TORCH infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bacterial infections with gram-positive and gram-negative organisms also have been associated with cholestasis.

The key considerations are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholestatic liver disease is of variable severity and may stabilize by school age. It is managed conservatively, with treatment for pruritus and malabsorption as needed. Portoenterostomy (Kasai procedure) is not beneficial and is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. End-stage liver disease develops in approximately 20 percent of affected children and is amenable to liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pruritus is a common complication of cholestasis, occurring in 80 percent of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Pruritus is often treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (ursodiol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rifampin</a>, or bile acid sequestrants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cholestyramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colesevelam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">colesevelam</a>), with variable success.

Interestingly, early presentation of AAT-associated liver disease during the neonatal period is not necessarily associated with a worse prognosis compared with later presentation during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].

The syndrome was previously thought to be rare but was found in 7 percent of infants presenting with cholestasis to a center in Korea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The disorder is caused by mutations in the <em>VPS33B</em> gene and is an autosomal recessive trait; many patients are from consanguineous families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>In addition to the three cardinal features, affected infants generally have severe growth failure, ichthyosis, central nervous system anomalies, and may have cardiac defects, recurrent infections, and diarrhea. Unlike many other cholestatic conditions, serum GGTP is usually normal.

Thus, the diagnosis should be made by mutation analysis, and organ biopsy should be avoided. Although the severity of the phenotype varies, virtually all affected infants die during infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/72,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">GESTATIONAL ALLOIMMUNE LIVER DISEASE (NEONATAL HEMOCHROMATOSIS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD), previously known as neonatal hemochromatosis or neonatal iron storage disease, is a disorder characterized by hepatic failure and hepatic and extrahepatic iron accumulation (hemosiderosis) during the neonatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The new term reflects the alloimmune mechanism that is responsible for the disorder, as described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The term &quot;neonatal hemochromatosis&quot; is misleading because the disorder is unrelated to hereditary hemochromatosis. Hepatic iron deposition may also be seen in some inborn errors of metabolism, including tyrosinemia type 1 and inborn errors of bile acid synthesis. The iron deposition is a consequence, rather than a cause, of the liver injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2527194153\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of GALD is intrauterine, and newborns present with signs of severe liver failure, including coagulopathy, ascites, and hypoalbuminemia. Hyperbilirubinemia typically is both conjugated and unconjugated, although conjugated bilirubin levels may be only modestly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Hepatic cirrhosis is common, underscoring the antenatal timing of the hepatic insult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of the iron studies. Traditionally, demonstration of extrahepatic (or extra reticuloendothelial) iron was required for the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/75,78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,78,79</a>]. However, now that the alloimmune mechanism has been recognized, cases may be identified by the characteristic immunohistologic features of alloimmune disease that are present (specifically, the anti-human C5b-9 complex). Cases with these immunohistochemical findings and with either mild or severe disease and no iron overload have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. Thus, the new understanding of the pathogenesis of GALD may allow for identification of infants with milder forms of the disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4085208\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GALD has been shown to be the result of maternal alloimmune injury (analogous to erythroblastosis fetalis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>]. Like other gestational alloimmune diseases, the disorder is caused by transplacental passage of specific reactive immunoglobulin G. The maternal alloantibody activates fetal complement cascade to produce a membrane attack complex and fetal liver injury. High levels of immunostaining for the anti-human C5b-9 complex (the terminal complement cascade) is the characteristic feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The target protein of the maternal immune response has not been identified. </p><p>The rate of recurrence of GALD in pregnancies subsequent to the index case is close to 90 percent, which is consistent with the mechanism of fetal alloimmune injury, rather than a genetic pattern of inheritance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. This recurrence risk is substantially greater than that for hereditary hemochromatosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The combination of exchange transfusion and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the current treatment of choice for neonates with GALD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/83,85-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,85-88</a>]. Liver transplantation remains an option for infants who do not respond to IVIG treatment. </p><p>Treatment with high-dose IVIG, which was usually given in combination with exchange transfusion, was described in a series of 16 infants with GALD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The treated infants had a substantially increased rate of survival without liver transplantation (75 percent) as compared with historical controls (17 percent). A subsequent update suggests transplant-free survival up to 79 percent (35 of 44 infants treated with IVIG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Although this approach is based on limited clinical evidence, it is logical in view of the alloimmune mechanism of disease and the effectiveness of IVIG in gestational therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>] (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Gestational therapy'</a> below). Exchange transfusion has not been evaluated as an independent therapy, but case reports have described complete remission of GALD after an exchange transfusion which was given in the early stages of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/86,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,90</a>].</p><p>Outcomes for infants who do not receive exchange transfusion or IVIG are poor, with approximately 10 percent survival without liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. Liver transplantation can be curative, but transplantation is difficult in this age group due to lack of appropriate donors and the increased risk of vascular and infectious complications. Thus, early referral is important. The outcomes of liver transplantation for GALD are fair but similar to the outcomes for other causes of acute liver failure in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/85,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,91</a>]. </p><p>Historical attempts to treat GALD included an antioxidant cocktail (no longer indicated), which was developed empirically based on the now-disproven hypothesis that the disease was caused by oxidative injury.
