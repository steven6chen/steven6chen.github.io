As a result, thrombolytic agents have been used in a variety of thrombotic disorders including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, acute pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).</p><p>The indications, contraindications, adverse effects, and outcomes of thrombolytic therapy in acute PE and DVT are discussed here. In addition, the types of thrombolytic agents and regimens are reviewed. Alternative treatment modalities and anticoagulation for acute PE and DVT are discussed elsewhere.

The effect of thrombolytic therapy on mortality and the frequency of recurrent thromboembolism remain questionable. (See <a href=\"#H448971564\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p>Typically, only patients in whom the diagnosis of acute PE has been confirmed should be considered for thrombolytic therapy because the adverse effects can be devastating. For each patient, the indications and potential benefits must be carefully weighed against the risk of adverse events, taking into consideration the patient's values and preferences. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent hypotension or shock (ie, a systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or a decrease in the systolic blood pressure by &ge;40 mmHg from baseline) due to acute PE is the only widely accepted indication for systemic thrombolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In most cases, systemic thrombolytic therapy should be considered only after acute PE has been confirmed because the adverse effects of this therapy can be severe. Because a pulmonary arteriogram immediately precedes catheter-based therapy, PE can be confirmed at that time when this procedure is undertaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The decision to administer thrombolysis is strongly influenced by clinical factors that are unique to the individual. For example, while a patient with proven PE-induced shock who is unconscious requiring very high doses of vasopressors is a candidate for immediate intravenous thrombolytic therapy, the indication is not as apparent in a patient who has low blood pressure for 20 minutes but who is awake, alert, and comfortable with low oxygenation requirement. Thus, when feasible, it is prudent to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to facilitate management of patients with PE and help with the decision of thrombolysis; some centers have incorporated a &quot;pulmonary embolism response team&quot; (PERT) to facilitate this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>The indications for systemic thrombolysis are discussed in this section. The details of administering systemic as well as catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18743561\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemodynamically unstable patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most clinicians and society guidelines accept that thrombolysis in patients with acute PE who present with hypotension is likely beneficial and therefore is a widely accepted indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. A similar approach is also appropriate in those whose course is complicated by hypotension assessed to be due to recurrent PE despite anticoagulation. Most societal guidelines also suggest catheter-directed therapies with or without thrombolysis in those with a high bleeding risk, those in whom death is likely to occur before systemic thrombolysis can manifest effectiveness (ie, within hours), or as rescue therapy following failed systemic thrombolysis, provided the necessary local expertise is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. However, we believe that systemic thrombolysis, even delivered over two hours, is generally faster than a catheter-based therapy with or without lysis, although this may depend on how quickly the latter procedure can be arranged. </p><p>Few trials have evaluated the effects of systemic thrombolytic therapy in hemodynamically unstable patients, but those that did found a consistent trend toward improved mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. A meta-analysis that included those trials did a subgroup analysis of 154 patients with massive (high-risk) PE and found that systemic thrombolytic therapy decreased the composite endpoint of death and recurrent thromboembolism (9.4 versus 19 percent, odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.22-0.92) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3211899996\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible indications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11044869\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemodynamically stable patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with acute PE who do not have hemodynamic compromise thrombolytic therapy is <strong>not</strong> warranted. Under occasional circumstances, thrombolysis may be considered on a case-by-case basis when the benefits are assessed by the clinician to outweigh the risk of hemorrhage and the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences have been taken into consideration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. </p><p>The following are situations during which clinicians typically contemplate thrombolysis, particularly when patients develop signs of deterioration (eg, increasing tachycardia, clinical signs of shock, worsening right heart dysfunction, worsening blood pressure, significant hypoxemia) despite maintaining a systolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82171\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82171 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe or worsening right ventricular dysfunction (&quot;submassive PE&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiopulmonary arrest due to PE (eg, BP &gt;90 mmHg after resuscitation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive clot burden (eg, large perfusion defects on <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> scan or extensive embolic burden on computed tomography)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free-floating right atrial or ventricular thrombus</p><p/><p>Although most patients listed above may not be initially treated with thrombolysis, they should be anticoagulated and monitored closely since they are at risk of deterioration and a decision to administer thrombolytics may need to be made promptly. </p><p>Assessing patients based upon a validated clinical prognostic score, preferably the PESI (or sPESI, its simplified version), has been recommended (2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">ESC/ERS</span> PE Guidelines) to distinguish between intermediate-low risk (abnormal sPESI + abnormal RV function OR abnormal BNP or troponin) and intermediate-high risk (abnormal sPESI + abnormal RV function AND abnormal BNP or troponin), this stratification cannot be utilized as a definitive means to decide whether thrombolytic or catheter-directed therapy should be administered. </p><p>Although retrospective reports suggest that outcomes may be no different between anticoagulation and reperfusion therapies among patients with evidence of right heart thrombus, we consider this population for catheter-based or surgical-based clot removal on an individual basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Similarly, some patients with paradoxical embolism and a large patent foramen ovale (PFO) may need surgical closure. There is no clear algorithm for patient selection for PFO closure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patent-foramen-ovale\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patent foramen ovale&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18743753\"><span class=\"h4\">Right ventricular dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most controversial situation in which thrombolytic therapy is often considered is right ventricular (RV) dilation or hypokinesis <strong>without</strong> systemic hypotension (also known as &quot;submassive&quot; or &quot;intermediate-risk&quot; PE). The rationale for thrombolysis in this population is based upon the observation that severe RV dysfunction is associated with a worse prognosis than mild or no RV dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/12,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21</a>]. However, randomized trials have not shown a convincing mortality benefit in these patients. This may be because clinical trials of thrombolytic therapy have not stratified this population based upon the degree of RV enlargement or the severity of RV dysfunction. As an example, this population of patients with acute PE constitutes a spectrum of severity such that patients with severe or worsening RV dysfunction and a markedly elevated brain natriuretic peptide level, with a substantial oxygen requirement and an elevated heart rate (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;120/minute),</span> is likely different than patients with mild RV dysfunction, a normal heart rate and no oxygen requirement. Thus, thrombolytic therapy in this population should be individualized and benefits and risks (of bleeding) should be carefully weighed on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults#H86226720\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>Several studies have shown improved RV function in association with the administration of thrombolytic agents (systemic and catheter-directed) and one meta-analysis has suggested a possible mortality benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/18,22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22-27</a>]. The largest of these trials was the randomized multicenter trial (PEITHO) trial that compared thrombolytic therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenecteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenecteplase</a>) plus heparin with placebo plus heparin in 1005 patients with acute PE who were normotensive and had evidence of RV dysfunction (ie, &quot;intermediate-risk PE&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. RV dysfunction was confirmed by echocardiography or computed tomography and a positive troponin <span class=\"nowrap\">I/T</span>. Tenecteplase was administered as an IV push with weight-based dosing (30 mg for &le;60 kg; 35 mg for 61 to 69 kg; 40 mg for 70 to 79 kg; 45 mg for 80 to 89; 50 mg for &ge;90 kg) and heparin was either unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin. Compared with heparin alone, thrombolysis resulted in a reduction in the primary endpoint of death or hemodynamic decompensation at seven days following randomization (6 versus 3 percent; odds ratio 0.44, 95% CI: 0.23-0.87). Subgroup analysis indicated that the differences in outcome were affected largely by the prevention of further decompensation; there was no difference in 7 day or 30 day mortality (2.4 versus 3.2 percent at 30 days). The administration of thrombolytic agents was associated with increased extracranial bleeding (6 versus 1 percent), major bleeding (12 versus 2 percent), and hemorrhagic stroke (2 versus 0.2 percent). In a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients older than 75 years, benefits of therapy were maintained but rates of extracranial bleeding were higher (11 versus 0.6 percent), suggesting that risk benefit may be more favorable in those 75 years-old or younger. Long-term follow up of these patients (approximately 3.5 years) reported no difference in mortality (20 versus 18 percent) and no difference in dyspnea or exercise capacity, right ventricular dysfunction, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (2 versus 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Further randomized trials are needed to identify subpopulations of patients with RV dysfunction where the benefits in mortality clearly outweigh the risk of hemorrhage before it can be routinely used to treat hemodynamically stable acute PE with RV dysfunction. Specifically, more data further stratifying intermediate-risk PE based on severity of RV dysfunction, biomarkers <span class=\"nowrap\">(troponin/brain</span> natriuretic peptide), oxygen requirement, residual DVT, and simple vital sign parameters such as heart and respiratory rate are necessary. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H370875365\"><span class=\"h4\">Cardiopulmonary resuscitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case reports and series have reported some success from systemic thrombolytic therapy during cardiopulmonary resuscitation when the cardiac arrest is due to suspected or confirmed acute PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. </p><p>One retrospective study reported a 5 percent incidence of PE (diagnosed by autopsy, clinically, or echocardiography) in 1246 cardiac arrest victims [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Subgroup analysis suggested that thrombolysis was associated with a greater rate of return of spontaneous circulation compared with those who did not receive thrombolysis. Another retrospective study of 23 patients with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) due to confirmed massive PE reported return of spontaneous circulation within two to 15 minutes after the administration of tissue plasminogen activator at a reduced dose of 50 mg intravenous push [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In contrast, another randomized study of 233 patients who presented with PEA arrest of unknown etiology reported that compared to placebo, thrombolysis did not improve survival or return of spontaneous circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>We believe there are insufficient data to argue for or against the routine use of thrombolytic therapy during cardiac arrest; however, the decision to administer treatment as a potentially lifesaving maneuver for suspected PE-induced cardiac arrest can be considered on a case-by-case basis.

As an example, a contraindication is of more concern if the indication for systemic thrombolytic therapy is RV dyskinesis, than if the indication is shock. </p><p>Absolute or major contraindications to systemic thrombolytic therapy in acute PE include an intracranial neoplasm, recent (ie, &lt;2 months) intracranial or spinal surgery or trauma, history of a hemorrhagic stroke, active bleeding or bleeding diathesis, or nonhemorrhagic stroke within the previous three months. Relative contraindications include severe uncontrolled hypertension (ie, systolic blood pressure &gt;200 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;110 mmHg), nonhemorrhagic stroke older than three months, surgery within the previous 10 days, pregnancy, and others that are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F95035\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95035 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thrombolytic therapy may cause moderate bleeding in menstruating women, but it has rarely been associated with major hemorrhage. Therefore, menstruation is not a contraindication to thrombolytic therapy. </p><p>As an alternative to thrombolytic therapy, catheter or surgical embolectomy may be warranted if the necessary resources and expertise are available.

Other thrombolytic agents include lanoteplase, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenecteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenecteplase</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reteplase-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">reteplase</a>.

Among the thrombolytic agents, it is the least expensive but most commonly associated with adverse effects, including allergic reactions and hypotension.

It is the major activator of fibrinolysis in the extravascular compartment, in contrast to tPA which is largely responsible for initiating intravascular fibrinolysis. Because the FDA-approved duration for tPA delivery is two hours, the use of streptokinase and urokinase decreased and these drugs are no longer available for use in the United States for acute PE. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the decision to administer thrombolytic therapy has been made, the thrombolytic agent is typically administered via a peripheral intravenous catheter as an infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although bolus and catheter-directed routes of administration have been studied, there are less available data (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Catheter-directed'</a> below). Unnecessary invasive procedures (particularly arterial punctures) should be minimized while thrombolytic therapy is being administered, and extreme caution should be taken with patients who have had PE-induced syncope with resultant head trauma even if the brain computed tomography (CT) is negative.</p><p>Anticoagulant therapy is generally discontinued during the thrombolytic infusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79949 \">table 3</a>). Our practice of discontinuing anticoagulants during thrombolysis is consistent with that most commonly performed in trials done in the United States. However, in other trials, particularly in Europe, this has not been the case. The potential risk of bleeding with continued anticoagulation and the risk of recurrent embolism while anticoagulation is discontinued is unknown. Full anticoagulation (usually heparin followed by an oral anticoagulant) following clot lysis is typically undertaken. The optimal duration of intravenous heparin following thrombolysis is unknown. Similarly, the duration of long term anticoagulation, once the patient is stabilized depends on a number of factors primarily focused on perceived risk for recurrence an absolute minimum of three months is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Although thrombolytic therapy is rarely administered to hemodynamically <strong>stable</strong> patients, the optimal method of administration is unknown. Our clinical experience suggests that if thrombolytic therapy is to be administered in, for example, intermediate-risk PE, catheter-based therapy rather than systemic therapy may be preferred, provided the expertise is available. This preference is based upon clinical experience and the likelihood of a lower risk of bleeding with this method of administration. Systemic thrombolytic therapy is a suitable alternative if local expertise is not available for catheter-directed techniques. While several catheter-based techniques are available only one ultrasound-assisted device has been approved by the FDA.

Guidelines suggest that catheter-directed thrombolysis may be considered for patients with persistent hemodynamic instability despite systemic thrombolysis, those at risk of death before systemic thrombolysis can manifest effectiveness, and those at high risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Intermediate risk PE was defined as PE of the main or lower lobe pulmonary artery and echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular enlargement (right ventricle to left ventricle ratio [RV:LV ratio] &ge;1). The USAT regimen consisted of high frequency ultrasound combined with 10 to 20 mg of tPA infused over 15 hours. At 24 hours, compared to conventional anticoagulation, USAT resulted in an improved RV:LV ratio (mean difference 0.3 versus 0.03), suggesting a hemodynamic benefit.

Importantly, any mortality benefit from thrombolysis came at the expense of an increased risk of major hemorrhage (9.2 versus 3.4 percent).

The rationale for treating this population of patients with thrombolytic agents is that rapid or immediate clot lysis provides symptom relief and restores limb perfusion, thereby avoiding digital or limb gangrene. Thrombolytic therapy should be considered only after DVT has been confirmed because the adverse effects of this therapy can be severe.
