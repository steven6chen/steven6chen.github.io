Less commonly, prosthetic valve thrombosis can cause regurgitation. Prosthetic valve obstruction or regurgitation may be associated with hemolysis. These complications may occur separately or concurrently. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term thromboembolism is commonly used to indicate clinical embolic events ascribed to thrombus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) can be symptomatic or subclinical, although the term &quot;PVT&quot; is sometimes used to denote symptomatic PVT. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptomatic PVT occurs when thrombus causes symptomatic prosthetic valve dysfunction. PVT can cause prosthetic valve obstruction (stenosis) or, less commonly, prosthetic valve regurgitation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Subclinical PVT occurs when PVT does not cause symptomatic valve dysfunction. </p><p/><p>Prosthetic valves are all obstructive compared with native valves. A variety of processes can increase the pressure gradient across a prosthetic valve above the expected range for a normally functioning valve. Prosthetic valve obstruction can occur weeks to many years after valve replacement. Of note, causes of prosthetic valve obstruction are not mutually exclusive (eg, pannus and thrombus can occur concurrently as can thrombus and endocarditis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-evaluation-of-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-and-obstruction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The main causes of mechanical prosthetic valve obstruction are thrombus and pannus. Infective endocarditis is a rare cause of obstruction in patients with mechanical valves. Thrombus is much more common than pannus, but the two causes can present similarly. Pannus formation is caused by fibrous tissue ingrowth around the prosthetic valve. In a surgical study of 112 obstructed mechanical valves, thrombus alone was responsible for 77 percent, pannus formation for 11 percent, and pannus formation in combination with thrombus for 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-evaluation-of-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-and-obstruction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Causes of bioprosthetic valve obstruction include <span class=\"nowrap\">pannus/fibrosis,</span> calcification, thrombus, and infective endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-evaluation-of-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-and-obstruction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In one report of mechanical PVT, 70 percent of patients with coagulation tests measured at the time of PVT were receiving inadequate anticoagulant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-evaluation-of-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-and-obstruction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Though data are limited, mitral mechanical PVT is approximately twice as frequent as aortic mechanical PVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-evaluation-of-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-and-obstruction/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>].

Limited data are available on the incidence and clinical significance of subclinical mechanical PVT since surveillance transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is generally not performed. In a study of 680 patients studied by TEE on day 9 after mechanical mitral valve replacement, abnormal findings consistent with valve thrombus were detected in 64 of 680 patients (9.4 percent) despite anticoagulation starting with intravenous heparin six hours after valve implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-evaluation-of-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-and-obstruction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. At intermediate-term (mean 34 months) follow-up, one or more complications (including transient ischemic attack, stroke, valve obstruction requiring surgery, and death) were observed in 3 of 29 patients with a &lt;5 mm thrombus and in 11 of 35 patients with &ge;5 mm thrombus. However, thrombus burden in mechanical valves is difficult to assess by any imaging modality due to the prosthetic image artifact.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3937232033\"><span class=\"h3\">Biologic prosthetic valve thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data are available on the incidence of biologic PVT.

Based upon comparison with the total number of bioprosthetic valve implantations during the study period, the estimated risk of biologic PVT requiring repeat valve replacement was 0.7 to 1.5 percent (46 cases of PVT compared with a total of 6178 implantations or to 3151 patients with at least one follow-up after initial implantation). The majority (65 percent) of cases of PVT were identified more than 12 months after implantation; 15 percent of cases occurred more than five years after implantation.

The incidence of thromboembolic events one to three months after surgery was substantially higher in patients not receiving VKA post-implantation compared with patients receiving VKA (13.07 versus 3.97 per 100 patient-years). This was associated with an excess risk of overall mortality in the patients not receiving VKA (33.8 versus 5.0 per 100 patient-years with VKA) during this time period. Between three to six months after valve surgery, thromboembolic rates remained higher in those not receiving VKA therapy (5.0 versus 1.9 per 100 patient-years with VKA), and mortality risk remained higher among patients not receiving VKA therapy (7.6 per 100 patient-years versus 2.1 per 100 patient-years with VKA therapy).</p><p>In a series of 326 patients undergoing bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement (most receiving VKA therapy), the rate of thromboembolic events during the first 10 days was 1.5 percent, during 11 to 90 days was 10 percent per year, and after 90 days was 2.4 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-initial-evaluation-of-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-and-obstruction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2900081781\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-term risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of thromboembolic events is lowest in patients with bioprosthetic valves (who are generally not anticoagulated), higher in patients with mechanical valves who are anticoagulated, and highest in patients with mechanical valves not receiving therapeutic levels of anticoagulation.
