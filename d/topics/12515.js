Through simultaneous recording of multiple physiologic parameters, particular changes in <span class=\"nowrap\">sleep/wake</span> state or specific abnormalities in one parameter can be correlated with other signals. PSG is thereby a much more powerful diagnostic tool than what can be provided by recording only one or two simultaneous measurements.</p><p>Younger and younger children are being referred to sleep specialists and sleep laboratories for evaluation of sleep disorders, which often require PSG for diagnosis, and sometimes treatment. While PSG is considered a painless, noninvasive procedure by most adults, it can be challenging and even frightening for children and therefore requires special considerations.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of PSG in infants and children, including indications for testing, derived information, techniques for obtaining useful data, and scoring and interpretation. An approach to the assessment and classification of specific sleep disorders in children is discussed separately.

The techniques reviewed below are derived from expert experience in recording over 1000 sleep studies in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-polysomnography-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1728191540\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preparing the child and caregiver before the PSG lessens anticipatory anxiety and procedural distress, increases cooperation, improves parental satisfaction, and helps the child tolerate future medical procedures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a sleep study is indicated, the clinician should describe the procedure in age-appropriate, positive terms and provide an explanation of why the study is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Written and visual preparatory material can be very helpful.

Surface EMG activity from the anterior tibialis muscles is routinely recorded to detect leg muscle activity and movements. (See <a href=\"#H28395551\" class=\"local\">'Recorded signals'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following the recording, <span class=\"nowrap\">sleep/wake</span> states and arousals are manually scored in 30-second sequential epochs. Respiratory events, periodic limb movements, paroxysmal motor behaviors, and other events are also scored, tabulated, and collated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111056\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111056 \">table 1</a>). The scored sleep study is then reviewed, revised where necessary, and interpreted by a sleep specialist.

The most common adverse events reported by pediatric sleep centers are falls out of a crib or bed, emphasizing the importance of fall awareness and other standard safety measures in the sleep laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H28395739\" class=\"local\">'Safety considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although in-laboratory PSG remains the preferred and appropriate study for the evaluation of both respiratory and nonrespiratory sleep disorders in children, the availability of PSG is limited in some regions, especially for infants and children. Alternative studies for detecting OSA may be considered if PSG is not available, recognizing that such studies do not precisely replicate results of full, in-laboratory PSG.
