However, the diagnosis can often be derived from a history, physical examination, and specific ancillary studies.</p><p>This topic reviews those causes of chest pain that are most common in primary care practice and the diagnostic approach to chest pain. The evaluation of chest pain in the emergency department is discussed elsewhere.

The most common causes of chest pain in outpatients are musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal conditions. Studies have estimated that approximately one-third to one-half of patients have musculoskeletal chest pain, 10 to 20 percent have a gastrointestinal causes, 10 percent have stable angina, 5 percent have respiratory conditions, and approximately 2 to 4 percent have acute myocardial ischemia (including myocardial infarction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82966\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1220523459\"><span class=\"h3\">Myocardial ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angina pectoris, or angina, describes chest pain attributable to myocardial ischemia. Classic symptoms of stable angina include a pressure, heaviness, tightness, or constriction in the center or left of the chest that is precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest. Other associated symptoms include provocation with emotional stress or cold, radiation (to the neck, jaw, and shoulder), dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, diaphoresis, presyncope, or palpitations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angina pectoris: Chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical presentation of myocardial ischemia varies by population. Women, diabetics, and older adult patients are more likely to present without chest pain but have symptoms of dyspnea, weakness, nausea and vomiting, palpitations, or syncope. Compared with older patients, younger patients are less likely to have stable angina and have a higher incidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

The ECG is helpful in the evaluation of patients with suspected myocardial ischemia as well as many other etiologies.</p><p>Patients with an ECG suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should be sent to the emergency room for further evaluation. Patients with a history suggestive of ACS but a normal ECG should have serial ECGs and should also be sent to the emergency department for evaluation. While a normal ECG markedly reduces the probability that chest pain is due to acute myocardial infarction, it does not exclude myocardial ischemia as an etiology (particularly unstable angina) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain/abstract/19,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,28</a>].

For example, in patients with high suspicion for coronary heart disease (CHD), a stress test <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> myocardial perfusion scan may be indicated.
