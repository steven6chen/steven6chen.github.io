Skin tags often grow on a short stalk or stem. They tend to form in places where the skin rubs together, such as the armpit, the neck, under the breasts, or in the groin. The medical term for skin tags is &quot;acrochordon.&quot;</p><p>Skin tags are harmless and many people have them. The chances of getting skin tags increase as you get older. People who are overweight have a greater chance of getting skin tags. Some pregnant women develop skin tags during the middle of their pregnancy, but the skin tags often shrink or go away after the baby is born. Skin tags also seem to run in some families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91450048\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should see your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are not sure that what you have is a skin tag.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin tag is irritated and painful.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91450063\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for skin tags?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have a skin tag by doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91450078\"><span class=\"h1\">How are skin tags treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is usually no reason to treat skin tags. Your doctor can remove the tag if it is painful or if you don&rsquo;t like the way it looks. There are different ways that your doctor might remove the skin tag. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Freezing the tag with a special fluid that gets very cold (called liquid nitrogen)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutting the tag off with surgical scissors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning the tag off with a special tool</p><p/><p>Skin tags can bleed when they come off, so never try to cut or pull off a skin tag on your own.</p><p>If you have a skin tag taken off, it is not unusual to form a new skin tag in the same area.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
