Urethral cancer is not one malignancy but a spectrum of diseases with various histologies. The approach to management and prognosis depends upon gender, location of the tumor within the urethra, and extent of disease.</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment of urethral cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3365456008\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An analysis from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database included 1075 men and 540 women with urethral cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The age-adjusted incidence rate was 4.3 and 1.5 per million in men and women, respectively. The incidence increased with age, with a maximum of 32 per million in men and 9.5 per million in women aged 75 to 84 years. In addition to the higher incidence in men, urethral cancer was also approximately twice as common in African Americans as compared with Whites. </p><p>A European study from the RARECARE project identified 1059 cases over a seven-year period and estimated that there are approximately 650 new cases per year in the European Union [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The age-standardized rates were 1.6 and 0.6 per million in men and women, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785088833\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although<strong> </strong>the etiology of urethral cancer is not well understood, factors that have been associated with urethral cancer include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Men with urethral cancer often have a history of sexually transmitted infections, urethritis, or urethral stricture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. As an example, in one study, men with urethral cancer reported a history of gonococcal urethritis, urethral stricture, or significant trauma in 37, 35, and 7 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Urethral strictures, which may develop following urethral trauma, are most frequently found in the bulbomembranous urethra, which is also the most common urethral segment involved with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In women, urethral diverticuli have been implicated in the development of cancer in up to 5 percent of cases, probably due to secondary chronic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Urinary stasis and infection may also be contributing factors. As an example, in one series of 90 women undergoing diverticulectomy, five (6 percent) were found to have invasive adenocarcinoma, with some others having evidence of intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 has been implicated in the development of both male and female urethral cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. As an example, in one series, HPV was identified in tumors from 11 of 18 women (61 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. HPV 16 was present in 9 of the 11 cases. A similar causal relationship may exist in men. In one series, tumors from 4 of 14 patients (29 percent) harbored detectable HPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. All four were the HPV 16 subtype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of human papillomavirus infections and the link to cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urothelial carcinoma is often multifocal and may arise in the urethra simultaneously with, precede, or follow lesions of the bladder, ureters, or renal pelvis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3512389818\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND HISTOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1058517580\"><span class=\"h2\">Men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumors of the male urethra are categorized by both location and histology.</p><p>The male urethra extends from the bladder neck to the urethral meatus, averages 21 cm in length, and is divided into the prostatic, bulbomembranous, and penile urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The prostatic and bulbomembranous urethra segments are lined with transitional epithelium that is similar to the bladder and upper urinary tract. The penile urethra is lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium, and the meatus is lined with stratified squamous epithelium. The most common site of involvement is the bulbomembranous urethra, followed by the penile and prostatic urethra (60, 30, and 10 percent of cases, respectively).</p><p>Most of the carcinomas of the penile and bulbomembranous urethra are squamous cell in origin, with urothelial and adenocarcinomas accounting for the minority of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In contrast, the vast majority of prostatic urethral carcinomas are urothelial in origin, although squamous cell carcinomas account for 10 percent of these cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Urethral cancer can directly extend into contiguous organs, such as the penis, or spread via the lymphatics drainage into the inguinal and pelvic nodes. The distal urethra drains into superficial and deep inguinal lymph nodes, while the proximal urethra drains into the external iliac, obturator, and internal iliac lymph node chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4200253553\"><span class=\"h2\">Women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The female urethra averages 3 to 4 cm in length space and is divided into an anterior segment, which comprises the distal third, and a posterior segment, which comprises the proximal two-thirds of the urethra. The proximal one-third is composed of transitional epithelium, while the distal two-thirds is stratified squamous epithelium. Along the entire urethra, however, there are submucosal glands, which are composed of columnar epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The lymphatic drainage of the female urethra is analogous to the male, with the distal one-third draining into the superficial or deep inguinal nodes, while the proximal two-thirds drains into the pelvic lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Squamous cell carcinomas represent the predominant histology in women, accounting for up to 60 percent of urethral cancers, while 15 to 20 percent are urothelial carcinomas, and 5 to 7 percent are adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. Proximal squamous cell carcinomas most likely arise from squamous metaplasia in the nonsquamous epithelium as a result of chronic inflammation. Mixed histologies are not uncommon and may be the result of differentiation of urothelial carcinoma into glandular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> squamous components. Adenocarcinomas arise from Skene glands as a prostatic homologue, with resultant prostate-specific antigen (PSA) positivity in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], from glandular metaplasia leading to <span class=\"nowrap\">columnar/mucinous</span> adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and rarely, from other sources leading to clear cell adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4185608506\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of urethral carcinoma varies depending upon gender.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men: In men, symptoms may be nonspecific, and diagnosis is often delayed. Symptoms can overlap with and be attributed to benign urethral strictures, which are far more common than cancer. Thus, any patient presenting with recurrent strictures should undergo biopsy of the diseased urethral segment since urethral strictures are associated with urethral cancer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other symptoms include hematuria (often initial rather than terminal hematuria), difficulty voiding, dysuria, urethral discharge, and urinary retention in advanced disease. Unexplained perineal pain, genital swelling, priapism, periurethral abscess, or fistula in an elderly patient should also prompt work-up to rule out urethral carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women: Most women with urethral cancer present with irritative voiding symptoms or hematuria, which is often mistaken for a urinary tract infection, which is far more common. In older women, recurrent or persistent pelvic symptoms, such as dyspareunia, should raise suspicion for the presence of urethral carcinoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph node and distant metastases: Up to 30 percent of men with urethral cancers present with regional lymph node metastasis at diagnosis, with less than one-half of these being clinically palpable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Approximately 10 percent of patients have distant metastases at time of presentation, with the most frequent sites of involvement being the lungs, liver, and bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. These patients generally have extensive locally advanced primary tumors, along with regional nodal involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69016396\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed evaluation is essential to make the diagnosis and assess the extent of disease. Definitive diagnosis requires biopsy confirmation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Work-up should begin with a physical examination and evaluation of the palpable portion of the urethra as well as the inguinal lymph nodes. In women, this includes a bimanual examination. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystourethroscopy should be performed to evaluate the extent of disease. Retrograde urethrography in men can help establish the exact location and extent of disease. In patients with recurrent or extensive urethral strictures or abnormal urethral mucosa, urine cytology should be sent. If clinical suspicion remains high, however, definitive diagnosis should be made with transurethral biopsies since the sensitivity of cytology is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cross-sectional imaging using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be obtained to evaluate for locoregional spread of cancer. Chest imaging must be performed to rule out metastatic disease. Newer MRI techniques allow superior soft tissue resolution and better delineation of tissue planes that may be helpful in surgical staging and planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT imaging may be useful to exclude distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Bone scan should only be ordered if there are symptoms, an elevated alkaline phosphatase, or suggestion of disease on cross-sectional imaging. There are currently no available data on use of positron emission tomography (PET) scan for imaging or staging.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915809304\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate clinical staging is paramount given the array of various treatment options. Proper clinical staging consists of appropriate imaging, as mentioned above, examination under anesthesia with cystoscopy, and palpation of the genitalia, urethra, rectum, and perineum, in addition to bimanual examination to assess local tumor involvement. </p><p>Transurethral biopsy of the lesion is critical for accurate histologic evaluation. Cytologic studies of voided urine alone are not a reliable source for diagnosis of primary urethral carcinoma. Sensitivity of cytology is greatest with urothelial cell carcinomas (80 percent) and tumors in the pendulous urethra (73 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system is used for staging carcinoma of the urethra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110807\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110807 \">table 1</a>). The eighth edition of this system (2017) is supported by both the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union for Cancer Control (UICC). Staging is based on depth of invasion of the primary tumor and the presence or absence of regional lymph node involvement and distant metastasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1914427471\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1259400304\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no prospective trials to guide treatment recommendations for patients with urethral cancer. The treatment approaches in both men and women are based on small case series and extrapolation from the management of other malignancies of the urinary tract. Treatment varies widely based upon location, extent, histology, and gender. Contemporary reports have combined experience from higher volume centers in order to provide additional insight into the disease and its treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with localized disease, surgery is generally preferred. Surgical approaches range from transurethral resection to excision using partial or total urethrectomy techniques with or without radical cystectomy and heterotopic urinary diversion depending upon the site and extent of disease, as well as gender.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locally advanced cases are best treated with multimodal therapy consisting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy (RT) followed by surgical extirpation, although experience is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with metastatic disease have a poor prognosis. Management generally includes systemic therapy; in rare cases, palliative surgery may have a role.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2528672876\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2597121656\"><span class=\"h3\">Men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For men with urethral carcinoma, surgery depends upon the location and extent of disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with low-grade tumors or small, high-grade, noninvasive tumors may be treated with endoscopic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. While this approach allows maximal functional preservation, it is also associated with a high risk of recurrence, and vigilant endoscopic follow-up is required. Patients with high-grade, localized (T1) disease ideally should be treated with segmental resection, although endoscopic management is feasible in men if the tumor can be completely resected with a pathology showing no evidence of invasive disease into the corpora.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with larger tumors or more invasive disease should undergo segmental resection with primary anastomosis, if possible. Very distal tumors near the meatus can be treated with distal urethrectomy with creation of a hypospadias. Sexual function is generally not compromised with these approaches, and patients should maintain full function, as in urethral stricture management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More extensive tumors involving the corpus spongiosum (T2 lesions) but not the corpus cavernosum can be treated with subtotal urethrectomy and perineal urethrostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male patients with urothelial carcinoma invading the stroma of the prostate should be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by radical cystoprostatectomy and urinary diversion, as in their bladder cancer counterpart. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-treatment-options-for-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant treatment options for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with very advanced locoregional disease may require extensive surgical resection to include penectomy and cystoprostatectomy with perineal reconstruction and anterior pelvic exenteration. Patients who have tumors abutting the inferior pubic ramus should undergo en bloc inferior pubectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H947510365\"><span class=\"h3\">Women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women with urethral carcinoma, surgery depends upon the location and extent of disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with low-grade tumors or small, high-grade, noninvasive tumors may be treated with endoscopic resection, although this is very difficult to perform given the anatomic limitations. Women can maintain continence as long as the urethral sphincter is preserved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urethrectomy with bladder neck closure and either suprapubic cystotomy, incontinent diversion (ileovesicostomy), or a continent catheterizable stoma using the Mitrofanoff principle may be utilized in women with more extensive disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with very advanced locoregional disease may require extensive surgical resection to include anterior pelvic exenteration including anterior vaginectomy. Patients who have tumors abutting the inferior pubic ramus should undergo en bloc inferior pubectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543490616\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT for urethral cancer is an alternative treatment that has the potential advantage of preserving function. Outcomes appear to be similar to those in surgical series, although the data are limited, and there is selection bias in the reported series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Either external beam RT or brachytherapy may be used for anterior urethral tumors in men and more proximal tumors in women.</p><p>RT alone may be sufficient in patients with localized tumors (stage T1 or T2) with or without radiosensitizing chemotherapy. Locally advanced tumors are best treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by assessment of the extent of disease prior to RT. Radiation may also be used for management of locally advanced disease not amenable to surgical resection, or for palliation in metastatic disease.</p><p>In men, complication rates can be as high as 20 percent following RT and include fibrosis, radiation cystitis, urethritis, chronic penile edema, and rarely, fistula formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Urethral strictures may result from treatment with RT, and strictures require biopsy to rule out recurrent disease.</p><p>In women, definitive RT is associated with good outcomes in early stage urethral cancers. In small series, local disease control rates between 60 and 100 percent have been reported using either brachytherapy, external beam RT, or a combination of both techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-36</a>]. In the largest reported series, 86 patients were treated with external beam RT, brachytherapy, or combination therapy after excision or biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The five-year local control rate was 64 percent. However, 27 of 55 patients (49 percent) who achieved local control had complications, most of which were considered moderate or severe in nature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2135365371\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemoradiotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive chemoradiotherapy can be utilized for patients who are not candidates for primary surgery or who refuse surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/26,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,38-40</a>]. Definitive chemoradiotherapy has been patterned after that used for anal cancer.</p><p>The results with this approach are illustrated by two series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one, 18 men (17 with squamous cell carcinoma) were treated with RT to the primary lesion and the regional lymph nodes, followed by two cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Salvage surgery was performed for patients with a recurrence. Most patients (83 percent) had advanced disease (T3 or T4), and one-third had regional lymph node involvement. This approach led to complete response in 15 of 18 patients, with a five-year overall survival rate of 60 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series, 29 male patients (all with squamous cell carcinoma, 88 percent of whom had T3 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nodal disease) were treated with chemoradiotherapy consisting of two cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C, and concurrent external beam RT to include the inguinal and external iliac lymph nodes. With a median follow-up of three years, 79 percent achieved complete response to the treatment. However, 8 of 19 (42 percent) patients with complete response had disease recurrence at a median of 12.5 months. Five-year overall and disease-specific survival rates were 52 and 68 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103820865\"><span class=\"h2\">Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioperative treatment with chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy may decrease tumor bulk and the extent of surgery required to treat a primary urethral carcinoma.</p><p>The potential role of perioperative treatment was illustrated by a multicenter study of 124 patients with primary urethral cancer in which 39 received perioperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (12 with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 6 with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus RT, and 21 with adjuvant chemotherapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. At a median follow-up of 21 months, the objective response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy were 25 and 33 percent, respectively. </p><p>In the overall series, 26 patients had cT3 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> node-positive disease; in these patients, five had neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and three had neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Surgery was followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in eight, and surgery was used alone in 10. The three-year overall survival rate for the eight patients who received neoadjuvant therapy was 100 percent, while 50 percent of those treated with surgery alone and 20 percent of those given surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy were alive at three years.</p><p>For patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, the chemotherapy regimen should be based upon the histology of the tumor.

Routine lymph node dissection is generally not indicated, except when enlarged nodes are identified on imaging or in those with palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is some limited evidence that lymphadenectomy in men with palpable disease may improve the long-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/17,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,42,43</a>].</p><p>Some investigators have suggested sentinel inguinal lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as an alternative to inguinal lymphadenectomy; however, unlike penile cancer, this approach has not been formally evaluated in patients with urethral cancer with high false-negative rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H138163541\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjuvant radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following surgical resection, adjuvant RT may be considered in patients with locally advanced disease or positive resection margins, although there is a significant paucity of adequate data to guide management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/41,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,44</a>]. General oncological principles should be followed when managing locally advanced disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1503699980\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors that may affect prognosis include histology, stage, and location of tumor. The impact of various factors and the overall results are illustrated by several large series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multi-institutional series analyzed outcomes in 154 patients (109 men, 45 women) treated over a 10-year period; the series was predominantly comprised of urothelial carcinoma (47 percent), with squamous cell carcinoma (30 percent) and adenocarcinoma (11 percent) representing the majority of the rest. Clinical nodal stage was the only independent predictor for overall survival. Recurrence-free survival was significantly associated with tumor location and age, in addition to clinical nodal stage. No significant association was found between recurrence and histologic subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 2065 men in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database who were diagnosed between 1988 and 2006, overall survivals at 5 and 10 years were 46 and 29 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Most patients were treated with simple surgical excision, with only 10 percent undergoing radical resection and 10 percent receiving radiation therapy. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with an improved prognosis included younger age, the absence of nodal or distant metastases, and lower histologic grade. Prognosis seemed to be slightly better for patients with adenocarcinoma, with 5- and 10-year cancer-specific survivals of 68 and 60 percent, respectively. In the subset of patients with T2-T4 non-metastatic disease, surgery appeared to be associated with a survival benefit compared with radiation therapy, although there are numerous limitations to such comparisons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another SEER database study evaluated prognosis in 722 women with primary urethral cancers diagnosed between 1983 and 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. There was an even distribution among urothelial, squamous, and adenocarcinomas; 25 percent of women were identified as African American. Surgery was again the predominant form of treatment, with 69 percent undergoing some form of resection and with 42 percent receiving radiation as part of their treatment. Five- and 10-year overall survivals were 43 and 32 percent, respectively, with 5- and 10-year cancer-specific survivals of 53 and 46 percent. In the multivariate analysis, negative prognostic factors included African American race, advanced stage, and node-positive disease. Radiation, whether used primarily or in the adjuvant setting, did not appear to improve cancer-specific survival, although again, there could have been some selection bias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impact of size and location of a urethral cancer in women was illustrated by a series of 72 patients treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering over a period of 36 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Those with tumors &le;2 cm in size in the distal urethra had a 60 percent five-year survival rate, while those with proximal lesions &gt;4 cm only had a 13 percent five-year survival rate.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354464954\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE FOLLOWING TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients require vigilant follow-up after potentially curative treatment given the significant rates of recurrence. Surveillance should include physical examination with close attention to the inguinal lymph nodes, and endoscopic evaluation to look for recurrent tumors in any retained urethra. Cross-sectional imaging may also be required.</p><p>While there is no evidence to suggest an optimal surveillance schedule, we follow general oncologic principles for follow-up, with visits every three to four months in the first two years, and semiannually for five years, after which patients can be seen annually.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2636981182\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF RECURRENT OR METASTATIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy is generally the treatment of choice for palliation of recurrent or metastatic disease, although neither is very effective at providing long-term local or distant control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In general, treatment approaches should be directed at the histology of the tumors, with consideration for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with urothelial malignancies or targeted therapies based on genomic testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2369795433\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urothelial carcinoma is more common in men than in women. In men, urothelial carcinoma is the most common histology, while in women, squamous cell carcinoma is more common. Recurrent or persistent urethral stricture, dyspareunia, or unexplained lower urinary tract symptoms should warrant further work-up including thorough physical examination, imaging of the lower urinary tract, and cystoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H3512389818\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and histology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early diagnosis is essential to maximizing the chance for cure. Diagnosis and staging include physical examination of the genitalia, perineum, and urethra, as well as bimanual examination. Cross-sectional imaging should be used for staging and to rule out distant disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generally provides the best anatomic detail to define the local extent of urethral cancer. (See <a href=\"#H69016396\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men with stage Ta, Tis, and T1, solitary, low-grade, papillary lesions, we suggest local treatment with transurethral (endoscopic) resection or fulguration (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This approach allows maximal functional preservation; however, it is associated with a high risk of recurrence, and vigilant endoscopic follow-up is required. Distal lesions that cannot be controlled with endoscopic resection are typically managed with distal partial penectomy. (See <a href=\"#H2597121656\" class=\"local\">'Men'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with Ta, T1, and T2 lesions of the distal urethra, we suggest local surgical excision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Radiation therapy is a reasonable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H4200253553\" class=\"local\">'Women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with locally advanced (stage T3 or T4) urethral cancer, management consists of a combined modality approach, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiation or surgery, or chemoradiotherapy followed by consolidation surgery. Surgical treatment consists of an en bloc resection of the urethra, prostate, and bladder, along with penectomy in men, and anterior vagina and bladder in women with or without a partial pubectomy. (See <a href=\"#H1914427471\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prospective multi-institutional registries and trials are needed to further characterize this diverse disease to find optimal management strategies. Consultation with and referral to centers with experience is highly recommended and may improve outcomes.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Swartz MA, Porter MP, Lin DW, Weiss NS.
