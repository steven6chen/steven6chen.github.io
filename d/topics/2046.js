The subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I and bipolar II. Patients with bipolar I disorder experience manic episodes, and nearly always experience hypomanic and major depressive episodes. Bipolar II disorder is marked by at least one hypomanic episode, at least one major depressive episode, and the absence of manic episodes. Additional information about the clinical features and diagnosis of bipolar disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H4503550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123830\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent mood episodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bipolar disorder is characterized by recurrent mood episodes that can be life-threatening. As an example, the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) prospectively followed 858 patients who recovered from a mood episode, and found that within two years a recurrent episode occurred in nearly 50 percent, despite receiving treatment at specialty mood disorder clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, a meta-analysis of three studies lasting four years prospectively followed patients (n = 198) who recovered from an episode of mania and found that a recurrent mood episode occurred in 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For each patient, manic and depressive episodes may recur in roughly equal proportions, or there may be a predominant polarity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Recurrence of bipolar mood episodes is associated with a greater number of suicide attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>], as well as poorer social and occupational functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, treatment resistance for each episode appears to increase with each additional recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest maintenance pharmacotherapy for every patient with bipolar disorder, and observational studies support starting maintenance pharmacotherapy early in the course of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Adjunctive psychotherapy during maintenance treatment is also indicated for all bipolar patients to prevent relapses and enhance adherence. The goals for maintenance therapy are to reduce residual symptoms, delay and prevent recurrence of new mood episodes, reduce the risk of suicide, and improve psychosocial functioning. Maintenance pharmacotherapy for bipolar disorder is consistent with multiple practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. </p><p>Although most maintenance pharmacotherapy studies have primarily or exclusively enrolled patients with bipolar I disorder, we suggest maintenance treatment for bipolar II disorder as well. Patients with bipolar II disorder are symptomatically ill more than 50 percent of their lives following onset of the illness and are at high risk for suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>We also suggest maintenance pharmacotherapy for other specified bipolar disorder, based upon our clinical experience. Although there are no controlled trials or observational studies to guide management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], the disorder is nevertheless a clinically significant syndrome that requires acute and maintenance treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Suicide attempts may be minimized by maintenance therapy. An observational study of 406 patients followed for up to 22 years found that bipolar patients who received maintenance treatment had lower rates of suicide deaths compared with those not treated (standardized mortality ratio 6 versus 27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In addition to preventing relapse in patients with bipolar disorder, maintenance pharmacotherapy may be associated with reduced rates of violent behavior. A national registry study identified 494 convictions for violent crime (eg, assault, robbery, or <span class=\"nowrap\">threats/intimidation)</span> in 11,918 patients with bipolar disorder and examined the time periods when patients were or were not prescribed mood stabilizers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>) or antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The rate of violent behavior when mood stabilizers were prescribed was 60 percent less, compared with times when mood stabilizers were not prescribed (hazard ratio 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.7). In addition, prescription of antipsychotics was associated with a 50 percent decrease in interpersonal violence (hazard ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9). Additional information about violent behavior in bipolar disorder is discussed separately.

The same medication regimen that was successfully used acutely is typically selected for maintenance treatment. However, some medications are preferable for maintenance treatment due to their demonstrated efficacy and tolerability. (See <a href=\"#H124117\" class=\"local\">'Choosing pharmacotherapy'</a> below.) </p><p>In addition, we suggest combining pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Multiple randomized trials indicate that adjunctive group psychoeducation reduces the rate of recurrent mood episodes and enhances medication adherence. Add-on cognitive-behavioral therapy and family therapy can also improve adherence. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Choosing adjunctive psychotherapy'</a> below.) </p><p>However, it is reasonable to prescribe pharmacotherapy alone for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Psychotherapy may not be available and some patients decline it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H124117\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING PHARMACOTHERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9625303\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance pharmacotherapy usually consists of the same regimen that successfully treated the acute bipolar mood episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/15,17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,24</a>].

Medications also vary in the type, frequency, and severity of adverse effects, which influences clinician and patient preferences. As an example, a meta-analysis of six observational studies (n = 637 patients) found that the metabolic syndrome was present in more patients taking antipsychotics, compared with patients not treated with antipsychotics (45 versus 32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Clinicians should initially attempt to manage patients with monotherapy to enhance compliance and minimize side effects and costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, many patients require medication combinations for acute and maintenance treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

It is important to educate patients about the course of illness in bipolar disorder and to emphasize that in the context of the long-term relationship between the clinician and patient, the need for maintenance treatment will periodically be reevaluated in light of the patient's progress in maintaining symptomatic and functional stability. It may also help to point out that other chronic illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and asthma often require lifetime medications. Additional information about adherence with maintenance medications for bipolar disorder is discussed separately.

However, patients may want to stop maintenance medications because of side effects, inadequate response, medical illness, pregnancy, or a wish to be medication-free after a prolonged period of euthymia. Discontinuing stable treatment usually leads to a new mood episode:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 14 <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> maintenance treatment studies that involved discontinuation of lithium in 257 patients who had previously been stable for a mean of 30 months, more than 50 percent of the patients suffered a recurrence within 10 weeks of discontinuing lithium, and about 90 percent relapsed within the first year off of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequent study, among 32 patients successfully treated with maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> for a minimum of five years, 32 percent suffered a recurrence within one month of discontinuing lithium, and 62 percent within one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. </p><p/><p>Other risks of stopping maintenance treatment include hospitalization, persistent subsyndromal symptoms, family and economic losses, and suicide. Psychoeducation may help discourage patients from discontinuing effective maintenance treatment.

Clinicians should also monitor patients frequently for prodromal symptoms of early recurrence. Prospective, open-label studies show that tapering maintenance medication more slowly is associated with lower rates of recurrence, but that most patients suffer a recurrence despite the slower taper:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 78 patients who were effectively maintained on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> for a mean of four years and then discontinued it, recurrence within two years was significantly greater in patients who stopped lithium in less than two weeks compared with discontinuation over two to four weeks (95 versus 69 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 64 patients who were stable on maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> for a mean of four years and then discontinued it, recurrence within five years was significantly greater in patients who stopped lithium in less than two weeks compared with discontinuation over two to four weeks (94 versus 53 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p/><p>Based upon clinical experience, discontinuation of maintenance pharmacotherapy may be more successful for patients who have established relationships with their clinicians, as well as patients who have relatively few current psychosocial stressors such as relationship or occupational difficulties, getting married, or graduating from school. It may also be helpful to educate patients about relapse prevention (eg, identifying prodromal symptoms and avoiding risk factors for relapse such as substance abuse), and to develop a plan for patients and families to follow should relapse occur. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING ADJUNCTIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder, adjunctive psychotherapy can help prevent relapses and improve medication adherence. As an example, a meta-analysis of eight randomized trials (n = 830 patients) compared psychotherapy (eg, group psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or family therapy) plus pharmacotherapy with pharmacotherapy alone; the probability of relapse was lower in patients treated with adjunctive psychotherapy (odds ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Adjunctive psychotherapy is typically administered during maintenance treatment to euthymic patients, who are typically better able to participate in psychotherapy than acutely ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. </p><p>However, if adjunctive psychotherapy is used during an acute mood episode, the same psychotherapy is usually retained for maintenance treatment. This practice is supported by a randomized trial of 82 patients with acute mood episodes who were stabilized for four weeks with pharmacotherapy plus one of two randomly assigned adjunctive psychotherapies (either interpersonal and social rhythm therapy or the control therapy, called intensive clinical management) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Following stabilization, patients were randomly assigned again to maintenance treatment with the same psychotherapy or to switch to the other psychotherapy. Relapse occurred in fewer patients who maintained the same therapy compared with those who switched (18 versus 40 percent).</p><p>Adjunctive psychotherapies can be distinguished as first and second-line maintenance treatments, based upon the quality and quantity of data that demonstrate their efficacy in preventing recurrent bipolar mood episodes, as well as their beneficial effects upon medication adherence. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9632073\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For bipolar patients receiving maintenance pharmacotherapy, we suggest adjunctive group psychoeducation as first-line psychotherapy. Psychoeducation is a structured, time-limited program that teaches patients and family members about bipolar disorder, including its pathogenesis, clinical features, course of illness, and treatment; the program also addresses detecting prodromal symptoms. Nearly all other types of psychotherapy used for bipolar disorder include an element of psychoeducation because of its demonstrated success and the ease of administration. Several randomized trials indicate that group psychoeducation is efficacious both for preventing recurrent mood episodes and improving adherence to pharmacotherapy. The efficacy, administration, and content of group psychoeducation are discussed separately.

For these patients, we suggest either adjunctive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or family therapy for enhancing poor medication adherence. Multiple randomized trials indicate that CBT and family therapy are each efficacious for improving adherence.
