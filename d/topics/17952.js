Of the approximately 3 billion people living in more than 100 countries who are exposed to malaria, more than 240 million develop symptomatic infection annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-malaria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most of these infections are attributable to <em>Plasmodium falciparum </em>(90 percent), but <em>Plasmodium vivax </em>and <em>Plasmodium knowlesi </em>can also cause severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-malaria/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Approximately 863,000 deaths are caused by malaria each year; over 80 percent of the deaths occur among children in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Severe malaria is acute malaria with signs of organ dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high level of parasitemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-malaria/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> below.)</p><p>In endemic areas, young children and pregnant women are at high risk for severe malaria. Older children and adults develop partial immunity after repeated infections; therefore, these groups are at lower risk for severe disease. Travelers to areas where malaria is endemic generally have no previous exposure to malaria parasites and so are at high risk for severe disease.</p><p>Management of patients with severe malaria presents a broad array of clinical challenges given the complex pathophysiology of the infection involving multiple organ systems. These challenges are increased in endemic areas where access to diagnostic and therapeutic tools may be limited. Nevertheless, it is possible to provide excellent care for these patients.</p><p>The approach to treatment of severe malaria will be reviewed here. Issues related to management in both endemic and nonendemic areas will be addressed. Issues related to treatment of nonsevere malaria are discussed separately.

In areas where malaria is endemic, young children (ages two to five years) are at high risk for severe malaria, as are pregnant women. Older children and adults develop partial immunity to febrile malaria episodes (but not to malaria infection) after repeated infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-malaria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and thus are at lower risk for severe disease. Travelers to areas where malaria is endemic generally have no previous exposure to malaria parasites and so are at higher risk for progression to severe disease if infected with <em>P. falciparum </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-malaria/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Seizures and severe anemia are relatively more common in children, whereas hyperparasitemia, acute renal failure, and jaundice are more common in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-malaria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Cerebral malaria (with coma), shock, acidosis, and respiratory arrest may occur at any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-malaria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Issues related to clinical manifestations of malaria are discussed further separately.

Blood smears are useful for determining the degree of parasitemia, which is important for guiding management of severe malaria. In general, the heavier the parasitemia, the sicker the patient; however, asymptomatic patients may have high parasitemia, and patients with severe malaria can present with low-density infection. (See <a href=\"#H3546619\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring parasite density'</a> below.)</p><p>Issues related to diagnosis of malaria are discussed further separately.

Patients should be evaluated with attention to findings consistent with malaria as well as additional <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alternative causes of presenting symptoms. A full neurologic assessment should be performed, including assessment of the Blantyre coma score for children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74361\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74361 \">table 1</a>); the Glasgow coma scale is suitable for adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 2</a>). Temperature, heart rate and rhythm, respiratory rate and rhythm, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and weight should be noted, as should capillary refill and degree of pallor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of stupor and coma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of primary importance in the treatment of malaria is the provision of prompt, effective antimalarial therapy and concurrent supportive care to manage life-threatening complications of the disease. Supportive measures (eg, oxygen, ventilatory support, cardiac monitoring, and pulse oximetry) should be instituted as needed. During this time, intravenous catheters should be placed, and fingerprick blood samples should be obtained for laboratory tests needed immediately. Point-of-care testing machines can be used for rapid determination of hematocrit (packed cell volume [PCV] or hemoglobin [HemoCue]), glucose, and lactate. Additional tests can be done <span class=\"nowrap\">if/when</span> indicated: electrolytes, blood gases, renal function tests, full blood count, type and cross, blood culture, and clotting studies. Unconscious patients should have a lumbar puncture to rule out concomitant bacterial meningitis in the absence of contraindications (eg, papilledema). These tasks should overlap with institution of antimalarial treatment as well as other ancillary therapies as needed (including anticonvulsants, intravenous glucose and fluids, antipyretics, antibiotics, and blood transfusion).</p><p>Repeat clinical assessments should be performed every two to four hours for prompt detection and management of complications (in an intensive care setting, if possible). If the coma score decreases after initiation of treatment, investigations should focus on the possibility of seizures, hypoglycemia, or worsening anemia. Repeat laboratory assessments of parasitemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit,</span> glucose, and lactate should be performed in six-hour intervals. A flowchart summarizing the vital information may be used to guide management decisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79603 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-malaria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Important independent predictors for fatality among African children with severe malaria include acidosis, impaired consciousness (coma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> convulsions), elevated blood urea nitrogen, and signs of chronic disease (lymphadenopathy, malnutrition, candidiasis, severe visible wasting, and desquamation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-malaria/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This was illustrated in a large clinical study including 5246 African children with severe malaria. Other factors that were statistically significant predictors of death in univariate analyses but not in the multivariate model included tachypnea, deep breathing, shock, prostration, low pH, hyperparasitemia, severe anemia, and jaundice. Clinical features previously identified as being poor prognostic features that did not correlate with mortality in this study included age, glucose level, axillary temperature, parasite density, and blackwater fever.</p><p>Careful observation and thoughtful responses to changes in clinical status are the most important elements in looking after patients with severe malaria. Patients can make remarkable recoveries, and the time and effort to address the components of clinical care described in the following sections can reap tangible rewards in a relatively short period of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimalarial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of death due to severe malaria is greatest in the first 24 hours after clinical presentation.</p><p>Intravenous therapy should be initiated promptly, with close monitoring of parasite density. There are two major classes of drugs available for parenteral treatment of severe malaria: the artemisinin derivatives (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=artesunate-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artesunate</a> and artemether) and the cinchona alkaloids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-malaria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Patients who have received parenteral therapy for at least 24 hours and can tolerate oral medication may transition to an oral regimen for completion of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1003933628\"><span class=\"h3\">Pre-referral treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In areas where patients with severe malaria cannot begin intravenous therapy immediately and where artemisinin derivatives are readily available, patients should be treated with a pre-referral dose of intramuscular or rectal therapy and triaged to an acute care facility.</p><p>A single dose of intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artesunate-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artesunate</a> is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-malaria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The anemia improved within four to eight weeks following completion of artesunate therapy. The mechanism of delayed-onset anemia following administration of artesunate is not fully understood. Artesunate may kill malaria parasites without destroying the red blood cell (RBC), which makes the cells more deformable than other cells, thereby increasing the apparent number of surviving RBCs following parasitemia relative to the number of RBCs in patients treated with other antimalarial agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-malaria/abstract/21,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,35,36</a>].

Therefore, fluid requirements should be assessed on an individual basis. Reliable markers of intravascular volume depletion in patients with severe malaria include cool peripheries, delayed capillary refill, low venous pressure, and low urine output. Deep breathing (reflecting lactic acidosis) may also be a reasonable indicator of hypovolemia.</p><p>Clinical symptoms of hypovolemia frequently resolve with blood transfusion (when warranted).

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neurologic complications include altered sensorium, seizure, and coma. Clinical evaluation includes full physical examination, calculation of Blantyre coma score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74361\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74361 \">table 1</a>), funduscopic exam, and lumbar puncture. Seizures should be managed as outlined above. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hematologic complications include severe anemia and coagulopathy. Decisions regarding transfusion should be tailored to individual patient circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Transfusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypoglycemia is a common complication of malaria and a marker of severe disease; it should be suspected in any patient who deteriorates suddenly. The threshold for intervention among children &lt;5 years is &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (&lt;54 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL);</span> the threshold for intervention among children &ge;5 years and adults is &lt;2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (&lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. Hypoglycemic patients should have intravenous access established promptly, followed by administration of initial bolus of dextrose (0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of body weight), which is usually achieved with 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 10 percent dextrose solution. Blood glucose measurement after 15 minutes should be repeated, with administration of repeat boluses until the patient is normoglycemic. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Hypoglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypovolemia should be assessed on an individual basis. Adults with malaria appear to be more vulnerable to fluid overload than children; there is a narrow threshold between underhydration (and risk of renal impairment) and overhydration (and risk of pulmonary and cerebral edema).
