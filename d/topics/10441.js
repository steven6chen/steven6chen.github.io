VSDs occur in isolation or in combination with other CHD defects, as in an atrioventricular (AV) canal, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), and, occasionally, D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA).</p><p>The management of infants and children with isolated VSDs will be discussed here. The pathophysiology, natural history, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of isolated VSDs are discussed separately.

These factors are primarily dictated by the size of the defect and magnitude of left-to-right shunting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109955\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109955 \">algorithm 1</a>). The clinical examination and echocardiography (which also confirms the diagnosis) provides information on the size of the defect and degree of shunting.

These patients are typically asymptomatic and have a reasonable expectation of spontaneous closure or decrease in the size of the defect over time.

For patients with moderate defects, medical management may adequately address the needs of the patients. For those with more severe symptoms, surgical correction is usually necessary and medical management is aimed at reducing symptoms in the interim. (See <a href=\"#H2140913826\" class=\"local\">'Medical management of heart failure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Closure of the defect &ndash; For patients who are not adequately managed by medical therapy, and in those at risk for long-term significant sequelae (eg, pulmonary hypertension or valvar damage) surgical repair is generally warranted.

As a result, ongoing monitoring in the neonatal period is important to determine which infants will remain asymptomatic and require no intervention versus those who develop heart failure and require intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children#H163893476\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Post-delivery'</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, once the diagnosis of VSD is established in the neonate, the next appointment is scheduled at three to four weeks of life, provided the infant is well. The visit is timed to coincide with the anticipated onset of symptoms of heart failure in at-risk patients with moderate to large VSDs. In addition, parents and primary care providers are asked to monitor the patient for signs or symptoms of failure, which should prompt an earlier visit with the pediatric cardiologist.

The exception is trivial muscular VSDs. If initial imaging and Doppler demonstrate a very small, very restrictive defect, follow-up is not generally necessary until three to six months of age, by which time many will have closed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those patients who remain asymptomatic, a follow-up evaluation is scheduled with the cardiologist at around six months of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between visits with the cardiologist, routine care is provided by the primary care provider. If the patient becomes symptomatic (eg, poor weight gain, tachypnea), the patient should be promptly referred to the specialist for cardiac evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H1646016163\" class=\"local\">'Health care maintenance'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4237256421\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If at the six-month visit the murmur is gone, repeat echocardiogram is not necessary, unless clinical concerns arise (eg, endocarditis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who continue to have a murmur, but are otherwise asymptomatic and growing well at the six-month visit, are seen again by the pediatric cardiologist at approximately 12 months of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If at the 12-month visit with the cardiologist the murmur is gone, repeat echocardiogram is not necessary, unless clinical concerns arise (eg, endocarditis).

Echocardiographic follow-up is typically performed at three years of age for patients with membranous defects. In those with a muscular defect, no echocardiography is required if the patient remains asymptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic patients with residual small defects are usually followed every two to five years for overall assessment. Potential complications of residual small defects are rare and may include infective endocarditis, aortic regurgitation, right or left ventricle outflow tract obstruction and shunting from the left ventricle to right atrium. These complications are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical therapy is initiated in any symptomatic patient. However, since heart failure is not expected in association with small VSDs, the development of new symptoms, particularly late, should prompt reassessment of the original diagnosis and evaluation for other causes of the symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H4237256421\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4267242324\"><span class=\"h1\">MODERATE TO LARGE VSD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with moderate to large VSDs usually become symptomatic within the first months of life as pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) declines. The primary care provider should monitor the infant during the first weeks of life for manifestations of heart failure (eg, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, poor weight gain or failure to thrive, and diaphoresis particularly with feeding). (See <a href=\"#H1646016163\" class=\"local\">'Health care maintenance'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H23884780\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>If an assessment has not been done earlier, the infant is evaluated at three to four weeks of age by a pediatric cardiologist because of the expected decrease in PVR resulting in increased left ventricular (LV) flow. At that visit, the infant is assessed for early signs of heart failure. If symptoms develop, medical therapy is warranted as detailed in the following sections. Infants who remain asymptomatic should have ongoing follow-up and monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H4237256421\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3073990515\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3073990515\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regular follow-up should occur throughout the first year of life for all infants with moderate to large VSDs, even if symptoms are lacking. It is important to assess these patients for evidence of pulmonary hypertension. If the murmur is gone but the pulmonic component of second heart sound (S2) is increased in intensity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104785\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104785 \">movie 1</a>), an echocardiogram is obtained to estimate pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). For patients with estimated PAP &lt;50 percent of systemic arterial pressure, the risk of developing pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease (PHVD) is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with PAP &ge;50 percent of systemic arterial pressure are at risk of developing PHVD and they should be referred for surgical closure. (See <a href=\"#H16384953\" class=\"local\">'Management of patients with pulmonary hypertension'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Closure interventions'</a> below.)</p><p>Controversy exists regarding the optimal management of asymptomatic patients (no heart failure or failure to thrive) without pulmonary hypertension (ie, PAP &lt;50 percent of systemic arterial pressure), but who have a persistent large left-to-right shunt (ie, ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow [Qp:Qs] &gt;2:1) with corresponding LV dilation. Although many centers advocate closure by one year of age for these patients, others allow for more time for resolution of LV dilation beyond the first year of life. In one case series of patients with pressure-restrictive VSD and moderate to severe LV dilation without heart failure or pulmonary hypertension, conservative medical management with observation (mean follow-up of 7.8 years) resulted in spontaneous resolution of LV dilation and avoidance of surgical closure in 29 of 33 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, until larger long-term studies are performed to evaluate this conservative approach, it remains uncertain whether complications may occur in adults with sizeable residual VSDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Surgical intervention early in life may be necessary to avoid long-term sequelae. If symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of pulmonary hypertension develop, the patient should be referred for closure. Otherwise, the decision to close the defect is based largely upon the degree of LV dilation and provider and patient preferences. In most instances, the decision can be made by the end of the first year. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Closure interventions'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who remain asymptomatic after the first year of life without evidence of pulmonary hypertension or LV dilation, follow-up visits are scheduled every one to two years with an echocardiographic evaluation approximately every two years in stable patients. In addition, echocardiography is performed in children &gt;2 years old whose defects have not closed if outflow tract obstruction or aortic regurgitation is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The goals of therapy are to alleviate heart failure symptoms and normalize growth. Management of symptomatic patients includes nutritional support and pharmacologic treatment of heart failure (eg, diuretic therapy). Measures to prevent respiratory tract infections are also an important component of management (eg, influenza immunization and respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis if eligible). (See <a href=\"#H1646016163\" class=\"local\">'Health care maintenance'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H476105926\"><span class=\"h3\">Nutritional support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional support may facilitate weight gain in infants with moderate to large VSDs. These infants have increased caloric needs due to an increased metabolic demand and may need a caloric intake that is &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Infants with heart failure often tire with feeding and their intake may be limited. Increasing the caloric density of feeds can provide the necessary caloric intake in a smaller total daily volume, which the patient is more likely to be able to consume each day. The caloric density is increased by the addition of carbohydrate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medium-chain triglyceride preparations to conventional formulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

These infants usually take a long period of time to eat and the amount of time required to ensure adequate intake can be substantial. The use of nasogastric feedings may be necessary to improve caloric intake. This may include bolus or continuous feeds, which can be given at night or during the day. The use of these measures usually indicates that closure of the VSD will be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Fluid restriction is generally not helpful in the management of infants with heart failure related to VSDs because it tends to result in inadequate caloric intake. Although fluid restriction is often used in the management of adults and older children with heart failure, it is counterproductive in infants because they are totally dependent on a liquid diet. Diuretic therapy rather than fluid restriction should be used to reduce and prevent volume overload as discussed in the following section.</p><p>Infants with iron deficiency anemia should be treated with supplemental iron to increase the hematocrit and oxygen-carrying capacity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2140913826\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical management of heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical management varies depending on the severity of heart failure symptoms. Diuretics are the mainstay of therapy. Though angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been used in the past, their effectiveness appears to be minimal and they are no longer routinely used. In severe cases, intravenous (IV) inotropic agents may be used (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">milrinone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dopamine</a>).

Infants with Down syndrome are at increased risk of developing PHVD and therefore early surgical intervention may be warranted in patients with moderate to severe defects.</p><p>The goal of VSD closure is to alleviate or prevent heart failure symptoms and to intervene before irreversible PHVD develops, which may occur as early as six months in high risk patients. Patients with moderate to large VSDs who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy should generally be referred for closure intervention by the age of one year.

Any of these signs or symptoms should prompt an earlier appointment with the pediatric cardiologist. (See <a href=\"#H3356745212\" class=\"local\">'Neonates'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of treatment approach is based on the size of the defect and clinical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109955\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109955 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For asymptomatic patients who typically have a small defect and a reasonable expectation of spontaneous closure, we suggest no intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Symptoms typically occur in patients with moderate to large defects. (See <a href=\"#H2140913826\" class=\"local\">'Medical management of heart failure'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who are not adequately managed by medical therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have evidence of elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) or valvar involvement, we suggest closure of the VSD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Closure interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical therapy is focused on reducing the symptoms and complications of heart failure, and includes the following (see <a href=\"#H4237256421\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nutritional support to ensure normal growth by increasing caloric intake (see <a href=\"#H476105926\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional support'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diuretic therapy to reduce volume overload (see <a href=\"#H2140913826\" class=\"local\">'Medical management of heart failure'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immunoprophylaxis to reduce the risk of influenza and respiratory syncytial viral infections (see <a href=\"#H1646016163\" class=\"local\">'Health care maintenance'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who respond to medical therapy (including satisfactory growth), regular follow-up should occur throughout the first year of life. The frequency of follow-up visits is dictated by the severity of symptoms. Patients are monitored to detect any evidence of pulmonary hypertension that may indicate a need for surgical repair, to adjust the medical regimen as the patient grows, and to track potential resolution of the defect which would allow for discontinuation of medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1241218719\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VSD closure is generally indicated for patients with moderate or large defects associated with any of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent symptoms of heart failure despite maximal medical intervention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulmonary hypertension (ie, PAP between 50 to 100 percent of systemic arterial pressure)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent large left-to-right shunt (ie, ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow [Qp:Qs] &gt;2:1) with corresponding left ventricular dilation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, VSD closure is indicated in patients who develop aortic regurgitation or double-chambered right ventricle (which are potential complications that can develop over time in association with subpulmonic and membranous defects). VSD closure is <strong>not</strong> typically required for asymptomatic patients with only mild to moderate left-to-right shunting and normal PAP. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VSD closure should <strong>not</strong> be performed in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (ie, suprasystemic PAP) because closure of the defect may result in low cardiac output and increased perioperative mortality. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients who require VSD closure, primary patch surgical closure is the preferred procedure and is associated with excellent outcomes with low risk of mortality and low complication and reoperation rates. Transcatheter closure is generally reserved for patients with defects that are not amenable to surgical repair (eg, multiple muscular defects that may be difficult to visualize at the time of surgery). Transcatheter VSD closure is technically challenging and should be performed only in centers with considerable experience and expertise in interventional catheterization techniques and with surgical backup. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Surgical repair'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Transcatheter closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important aspects of long-term health care maintenance in children with VSDs, particularly those who have not undergone repair, include administering routine childhood vaccinations, monitoring growth parameters, monitoring for symptoms of heart failure, and providing guidance regarding exercise and sports participation. Antibiotic prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis is <strong>not</strong> necessary for children with VSDs except during the first six months following repair with prosthetic material or device <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> following repair if there is a residual defect at or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic device.
