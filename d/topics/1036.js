As an example, one study found that susceptibility testing of <em>Candida glabrata</em> isolates results in lower overall treatment costs, based on deescalation in therapy from an expensive echinocandin to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> for patients with documented fluconazole-susceptible <em>C. glabrata</em> bloodstream infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antifungal-susceptibility-testing/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The clinical breakpoints serve as criteria that not only predict clinical outcome but also improve the sensitivity of the CLSI methods to detect emerging resistance associated with acquired or mutational resistance mechanisms.

The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has developed and published approved methods for both broth dilution testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antifungal-susceptibility-testing/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] and disk diffusion testing of yeasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antifungal-susceptibility-testing/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

The tubes are then examined for turbidity, which represents fungal growth.</p><p>The broth microdilution method is a modification of the broth macrodilution test and allows for multiple tests to be performed simultaneously in smaller volumes in a 96-well plate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Yeasts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both broth macrodilution and microdilution methods for in vitro susceptibility testing of yeasts have been established by the CLSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antifungal-susceptibility-testing/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>The microdilution method employs a 24-hour incubation at 35&deg;C and a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) endpoint of &ge;50 percent inhibition (100 percent inhibition for amphotericin B) relative to the control well that has no antifungal agent added (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58379\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58379 \">picture 1</a>). This standardized method provides reliable and reproducible MIC results with good separation of the MIC distribution between wild-type <em>Candida</em> isolates that are susceptible and isolates possessing acquired-resistance mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antifungal-susceptibility-testing/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>].

This blueprint takes into account data that relate the MICs of the specific agent to known resistance mechanisms, the MIC distribution profiles, consideration of cross-resistance patterns, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters, and the relationship between in vitro activity (ie, MIC) and clinical outcome according to individual species, as determined by the available clinical efficacy studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antifungal-susceptibility-testing/abstract/12,27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,27,31</a>].

This change was made due to the recognition that MICs for the various agents were significantly lower for some species than others and that the previous clinical breakpoints for susceptibility of &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for fluconazole, &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for voriconazole and &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for the echinocandins were not appropriate for all species.</p><p>The updated clinical breakpoints are shown in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82995 \">table 2</a>); the general patterns are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>, the clinical breakpoints for susceptible (S), susceptible dose dependent (SDD), and resistant (R), respectively, are the same values for <em>C. albicans</em>, <em>C. tropicalis</em>, and <em>C. parapsilosis</em> and much higher for <em>C. glabrata</em>, reflecting the need to use higher doses (12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) of fluconazole if this agent is used in the management of C. glabrata infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antifungal-susceptibility-testing/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, the clinical breakpoints are the same values for <em>C. albicans</em>, <em>C. parapsilosis</em>, and <em>C. tropicalis</em> and are slightly higher for <em>C. krusei</em>.
