In many cases, therapeutic endoscopy permits a less invasive approach to the treatment of postsurgical complications. As a result, gastrointestinal endoscopists are becoming increasingly involved in the care of bariatric surgery patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late complications of bariatric surgical operations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the role of endoscopy in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery, highlighting the endoscopic management of gastrointestinal complications of the most common bariatric surgical procedures. The following discussion is generally consistent with the 2008 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Standards for Practice Committee guidelines on the role of endoscopy in the bariatric surgery patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>An overview of the various bariatric procedures, radiographic imaging after bariatric surgery, and the complications of bariatric surgery are discussed separately.

Less common symptoms include weight regain, heartburn, regurgitation, hematemesis, and melena. The etiology of these symptoms can be multifactorial and frequently involves noncompliance with prescribed food choices and eating behaviors.</p><p>An evaluation with endoscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic imaging is warranted to identify a source and exclude structural complications in patients with GI bleeding, biliary obstruction, or symptoms that persist despite counseling and behavior modification. Endoscopy has the added benefit of potentially providing therapy. Evaluation is particularly important in patients who present within the first three to six postoperative months, since this is when the majority of postoperative complications occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/5,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7-9</a>].

This also applies to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) cases in which the gastric pouch or the proximal Roux limb is being examined. However, a pediatric colonoscope or enteroscope may be needed to examine the jejunojejunal anastomosis, depending upon the length of the Roux limb.</p><p>Retrograde evaluation of the biliopancreatic limb and bypassed stomach is challenging in patients who have undergone RYGB, but can be accomplished in some cases with a pediatric colonoscope or an enteroscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The use of a ShapeLock enteroscopy guide to facilitate intubation of the bypassed stomach has been described in a small number of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Deep small bowel enteroscopy has been used to examine the bypassed stomach in patients who have undergone RYGB. The reported success rates have been as high as 88 percent, even in patients who have undergone long limb (up to 150 cm) RYGB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Methods for deep small bowel enteroscopy include double balloon enteroscopy, single balloon enteroscopy, and spiral enteroscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-deep-small-bowel-enteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of deep small bowel enteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Balloon-assisted enteroscopy uses balloons attached to an overtube with or without a balloon at the tip of the enteroscope. The balloons anchor the enteroscope and overtube as the enteroscope is advanced through the small bowel. With spiral enteroscopy, a spiral overtube is placed over the enteroscope. As the spiral is rotated, the small bowel is &quot;pulled&quot; onto the overtube, advancing the enteroscope through the small bowel.</p><p>Deep small bowel enteroscopy can also facilitate the performance of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy. However, this technique is not widely available outside of specialty centers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ercp-in-patients-with-roux-en-y-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ERCP in patients with Roux-en-Y anatomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPECTED FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Roux-en-Y gastric bypass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expected endoscopic findings after RYGB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79256\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79256 \">figure 1</a>) include a normal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions#H205574861\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions&quot;, section on 'Roux-en-Y gastric bypass'</a>.)</p><p>Examination of the stomach is limited to the gastric pouch, which varies in size, but is typically short (approximately 5 cm long) and has a small volume (less than 30 mL). The gastrojejunal anastomosis, or stoma, is generally 10 to 12 mm in diameter and should easily permit the passage of a diagnostic endoscope without resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58276\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58276 \">picture 1</a>). Distal to the anastomosis is a short, blind limb of jejunum alongside the efferent Roux limb, resulting in a &quot;shepherd's hook&quot; configuration. The length of the Roux limb is variable, now typically ranging from 100 to 150 cm. However, in the &quot;distal bypass&quot; modification, the Roux limb is extremely long, as the biliopancreatic limb is connected to the ileum approximately 150 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. It is important that the endoscopist carefully review the operative report <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> speak with the surgeon in the setting of &quot;distal&quot; gastric bypass, as there can be considerable variation in the limb lengths between surgeons and centers.</p><p>The endoscopic findings in the bypassed stomach have not been well characterized due to technical difficulties in reaching the bypassed stomach. Based upon studies using double balloon enteroscopy, the majority of bypassed stomachs demonstrate gastritis (erosive, erythematous, atrophic, or hemorrhagic), even in patients with a normal preoperative endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

Once traversed, the unaltered distal stomach and duodenum can be examined in the usual manner. Retroflexion of the endoscope within the distal stomach reveals the gastric partition and greater curvature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74191\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74191 \">picture 2</a>), and the scope tip can be &quot;pulled in&quot; to examine the gastric fundus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) is a purely restrictive procedure that compartmentalizes the upper stomach by placing a tight, adjustable prosthetic band around the entrance to the stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60081\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60081 \">figure 3</a>). Endoscopy reveals a variable degree of extrinsic, circumferential compression on the proximal <span class=\"nowrap\">stomach/gastric</span> cardia, usually within a few centimeters of the GEJ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56233\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56233 \">picture 3</a>).

In a study of 49 symptomatic patients, 85 percent had abnormal endoscopic findings within the first six postoperative months compared with 47 percent of patients evaluated after six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Stomal stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stomal stenosis should be suspected in patients who present with nausea, vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysphagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,9</a>].

The absence of these symptoms essentially rules out the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late complications of bariatric surgical operations&quot;, section on 'Stomal stenosis'</a>.)</p><p>Stomal stenosis is diagnosed when there is resistance to the passage of a standard diagnostic upper endoscope through the gastrojejunal anastomosis with RYGB or the pouch outlet with VBG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74282\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74282 \">picture 4</a>) in a symptomatic patient.</p><p>Stomal stenoses typically occur within three to six months following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/7,8,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,19-21</a>]. The time course was illustrated in a prospective study of 400 RYGB patients who underwent routine endoscopy (ie, regardless of symptoms) following surgery at one month and again after a mean of 17 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Stomal stenoses were diagnosed and treated in 25 percent of patients at one month and in none of the patients at the second examination. The majority of stenoses were mild (stomal diameter of 7 to 9 mm), and nearly 30 percent of patients with stomal stenosis were asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic dilation is first-line treatment for stomal stenosis in most patients with RYGB because endoscopic dilation using through-the-scope (TTS) balloons or wire-guided bougie dilators is safe and highly effective. The majority of cases can be successfully treated within one to three dilation sessions, and surgical revision is rarely necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/7,19,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19,23,24</a>].</p><p>The optimal technique remains to be determined. TTS balloon dilators are generally preferred given their ease of use, safety, and the ability to perform multiple dilations under direct endoscopic visualization without the need to repeatedly intubate the esophagus.</p><p>The primary goal of dilation therapy is symptom resolution, which can usually be attained at a stomal diameter of 10 to 12 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/7,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25</a>]. The size of the balloon or bougie used to perform dilation therapy should be guided by factors such as the severity of the stenosis, the time since surgery, the size of the initial anastomosis, and the presence of marginal ulceration. Most recent studies describing the use of balloon dilators in this setting have utilized balloons ranging from 10 to 18 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/7,19-21,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19-21,23-26</a>], with some suggesting an optimal goal of 15 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/4,19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19,21</a>].</p><p>Very tight stenoses should be gradually dilated over multiple sessions using progressively larger dilators and generally adhering to the &quot;rule of threes&quot; (ie, dilating no more than 3 mm sizes in a single session) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Endoscopists should exercise caution when attempting to pass a balloon dilator beyond a tight stenosis after RYGB because of the short blind stump of jejunum immediately (and sometimes directly) beyond the gastrojejunal anastomosis. In these situations, guidewire-assisted <span class=\"nowrap\">balloon/bougie</span> dilation under fluoroscopic guidance may be necessary.</p><p>Additional techniques that may improve the effectiveness and durability of dilation therapy for stomal stenosis include glucocorticoid injection and the removal of suture material at the site of the stenosis, although the benefit of these maneuvers has not been studied rigorously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>]. </p><p>Short-term stenting has been used to successfully treat stomal stenoses that are refractory to repeated dilation sessions, but complications such as pain and stent migration were commonly reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The risk of stent migration is lower with lumen-apposing metal stents, which have been used to treat stomal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In rare instances, needle-knife electrocautery incision can be used to cut open a completely obstructed stoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Perforation has been reported in up to 2 to 3 percent of patients undergoing dilation for stomal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. The risk can be minimized by starting with a dilator that is only slightly larger than the diameter of the stoma and increasing the size gradually. Avoidance of overly aggressive dilation will also reduce the risk of creating an excessively large stoma, which can potentially contribute to weight regain and dumping syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Stomal and/or pouch dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight regain after bariatric surgery can be attributed to several mechanisms, most commonly a lack of compliance with programmatic diet and exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. An excessively wide stoma or dilated pouch may contribute to weight regain after RYGB or VBG surgery by allowing more liberal food intake, although the significance of these findings, particularly stomal dilation, remains a matter of debate. A dilated stoma may also contribute to postprandial dumping syndrome by allowing rapid passage of food into the small bowel.

Subjects who underwent TORe had a greater mean weight loss from baseline than those who underwent a sham procedure (3.5 versus 0.4 percent). Weight loss or stabilization was achieved in 96 percent of TORe subjects, compared with 78 percent of controls.</p><p>Application of an endoscopic over-the-scope clip is another approach that can effectively treat weight gain due to a dilated pouch outlet. In a pilot study of 94 patients, an over-the-scope clip system was utilized to reduce the gastric pouch outlet size in patients who, two years after gastric bypass, had weight gain of at least 10 percent, redevelopment of comorbidities, increased volume per meal, or increased frequency of meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The mean diameter of the gastrojejunal anastomosis was reduced from 35 mm to 8 mm, an average reduction of approximately 80 percent. Although follow-up was limited, the results were promising in terms of weight loss, with a decline in mean body mass index from 32.8 to 27.4 at one year after application of the clip.</p><p>In addition to possibly helping with weight loss, a reduction of the stoma may also benefit patients with intractable dumping syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Fistulas and leaks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrogastric fistulas, gastrocutaneous fistulas, and gastric leaks can result from staple line dehiscence or an incomplete division of the stomach during pouch creation.

Band erosion can also result in abdominal pain, vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, intra-abdominal abscess, or fistula formation. In many cases, the first sign of band erosion is infection (cellulitis) at the site of the subcutaneous access port [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].
