Patients with NTM involving the lungs usually present with respiratory signs and symptoms such as chronic cough, sputum production, and, occasionally, hemoptysis. Disease can be fibrocavitary, <span class=\"nowrap\">nodular/bronchiectatic,</span> or a combination of both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2,4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,9</a>]. Patients may present with radiographic abnormalities such as pulmonary nodules or tree-in-bud opacities on chest computed tomography. In a small case-control study, larger opacities (&gt;2 cm) and cavitary nodules were more common in immunocompromised patients than in immunocompetent patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. <em>M. avium</em> complex (MAC), <em>M. kansasii</em>, <em>M. abscessus</em>, and <em>M. xenopi</em> are the most common causes of pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2,4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,9</a>]. <em>M. kansasii</em>, in particular, can cause aggressive disease in lung transplant recipients and often mimics reactivated pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), including cavitary infiltrates with an upper lobe predilection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Disseminated infection caused by MAC and other NTM typically presents with constitutional symptoms (weight loss, fever, night sweats). Interestingly, MAC infection in organ transplant recipients can primarily involve the allograft. There are case reports of MAC causing acute interstitial nephritis in renal transplant recipients and hepatic infection in liver transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

These may present as papules or nodules (frequently with purple discoloration). <em>M. marinum</em> infection is commonly known as fish tank granuloma and usually occurs after exposure to aquariums or marine environments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Several cases of fatal post-transplant <em>M. abscessus</em> infection involving the lungs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pleural space have been reported in lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/6,16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16-21</a>]; severe cases have also been reported in renal, heart, and multivisceral transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. A retrospective study of patients with cystic fibrosis found that colonization with <em>M. abscessus</em> prior to transplantation strongly predicted invasive disease as compared with isolation of other NTM species (odds ratio 7.45, 95% CI 2.9-16.9); this association was not observed for other NTM species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In an international survey of lung transplant centers, <em>M. abscessus</em> infections were identified in 17 of 5200 patients (0.33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Eleven of 16 patients (73 percent) who were treated had a radiographic or microbiologic response to therapy, and two died from the infection. Two patients had late recurrence of infection at a distant site following cessation of therapy.</p><p>In addition to <em>M. abscessus</em>, the other NTM species that have been associated with disseminated infections in solid organ transplant recipients are <em>M. chelonae</em> and <em>M. kansasii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) should be considered in solid organ transplant recipients with pulmonary complaints, especially lung transplant recipients. Staining and culture for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) should be performed on all bronchoscopy specimens. In addition, mycobacterial infections should be considered in transplant recipients with atypical skin lesions or soft tissue infections. Skin biopsy should be performed in all patients with suspicious lesions and should be sent for AFB staining and culture as well as histopathology.

In a cohort study of 237 lung transplant recipients, NTM were isolated from 53 patients (22.4 percent), but only 6 patients required treatment (2 met criteria for pulmonary disease and 4 had surgical site infections) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although the incidence rate of NTM isolation was 9.0 per 100 person-years, that of NTM disease was only 1.1 per 100 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The burden of organisms recovered, the specific NTM species involved, and clinical and radiographic signs and symptoms should be considered when defining the approach to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For example, since <em>M. abscessus</em> is particularly virulent, the isolation of this species from a post-transplant sputum culture should warrant an aggressive evaluation and careful consideration of treatment.</p><p>Specific criteria exist for establishing the diagnosis of NTM disease, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61404 \">table 2</a>); these criteria are discussed in detail separately.

NTM colonization was a risk factor for NTM disease (hazard ratio [HR] 8.39, 95% CI 2.08-33.85) and presence of either colonization or disease significantly increased the risk of death after lung transplant even when controlling for factors such as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (adjusted HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.26-3.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>As described above, <em>M. abscessus</em> can be particularly aggressive in lung transplant recipients, sometimes leading to relapse even after long courses of antimicrobial therapy or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of NTM disease depends on the infecting species, the site(s) of involvement, and whether the infection is localized or disseminated. Pleuropulmonary disease is the most common manifestation of NTM infection among solid organ transplant recipients, occurring in over 50 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NTM should be considered in solid organ transplant recipients with pulmonary complaints. Staining and culture for acid-fast bacilli should be performed on all bronchoscopy specimens. In addition, mycobacterial infections should be considered in solid organ transplant recipients with atypical skin lesions or soft tissue infections. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific criteria exist for establishing the diagnosis of NTM disease as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61404 \">table 2</a>).

The most significant interaction is between the rifamycins and both the calcineurin inhibitors and rapamycin. Certain macrolides, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, also interact significantly with both the calcineurin inhibitors and rapamycin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Solid organ transplant recipients often require a longer course than immunocompetent hosts in order to prevent relapse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The intensity of the immunosuppressive regimen should be reduced whenever possible. Immune reconstitution inflammatory response syndrome can occur when immunosuppressive regimens are reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Susceptibility testing can be particularly helpful in managing NTM infections in solid organ transplant recipients given the potential for drug interactions and toxicities. The agents that should be included in susceptibility testing vary depending upon which species is isolated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgical resection of localized skin lesions can be used as an adjunct to medical therapy in the setting of abscess formation, to debulk areas with a large burden of disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in patients who have not responded to antimycobacterial therapy.
