Secondary neurologic injury results from a biochemical cascade of events such as hemorrhage, release of vasoactive amines, and edema. Prevention of secondary injury is the primary goal of prehospital and hospital care of the young athlete with acute neck injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe neck injuries with permanent neurologic sequelae occur rarely among young athletes. Because these injuries are uncommon, most youth team physicians and trainers have little experience managing them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Nonetheless, the management of athletes with potential cervical spine injuries must be a well-coordinated process.</p><p>Personnel involved in youth team sports, particularly the team physician, must be prepared for the possibility of a cervical spine injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Adequate preparation and familiarity with individual roles and duties are of paramount importance in avoiding preventable catastrophic injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. Preseason rehearsal of the acute care of the injured athlete can help prevent the stress and confusion that may arise when a severe injury occurs without such rehearsal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arrangements should be made to have an ambulance at the athletic event (particularly football games) or readily available in case an athlete requires urgent transport to a medical facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Because of the vital importance of these structures, athletes with acute complaints of neck pain or injury must be thoroughly evaluated so that appropriate management and referral decisions can be made, and preventable catastrophic injuries can be avoided.</p><p>The field medical personnel should watch the sporting event carefully so that, if at all possible, they can directly witness the mechanism of injury. Every athlete with an acute neck injury must be assumed to have a serious spinal cord injury until proven otherwise. This is particularly applicable in the case of an athlete who has lost consciousness because the symptoms and signs of cervical injury may be less obvious than in the awake athlete, who can complain of cervical muscle spasm or pain. However, even in the conscious athlete, cervical spine injuries may or may not have observable neurologic findings, and a high index of suspicion must be maintained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Because cervical spine injuries can progress, not all significant injuries may be recognized immediately. Suspicion and recognition of cervical spine injuries in the athlete who is able to walk from the field are discussed below.

No attempt should be made to move the athlete except as necessary to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or transportation to a medical facility.</p><p>Before resuscitation or transport, the cervical spine motion restriction must be applied and maintained until cervical spine injury is ruled out clinically or radiographically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An estimated 3 to 25 percent of patients with spinal cord injury develop neurologic deficits as a result of manipulation during resuscitation or transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Extension of cervical cord injury can be avoided with proper spinal motion restriction and careful airway management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Cervical spine motion restriction is discussed in detail separately.

No traction should be applied. Care must be taken for motion restriction of an obviously deviated cervical spine; it should be stabilized as is without any attempt at straightening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients who are in the prone or side position must be log-rolled to the supine position on to a rigid longboard for further evaluation and management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The cervical spine should be manually stabilized during the log roll procedure until a collar can be placed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80874 \">figure 1</a>). The log-roll maneuver is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Helmet removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether to maintain the helmet in place or remove it varies by whether shoulder pads are also worn as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Helmet with shoulder pads</strong> &ndash; We and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) strongly recommend <strong>not</strong> to remove an American football helmet and shoulder pads from an unconscious athlete or an athlete who has sustained a neck injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Proper motion restriction of the spine and safe transportation to the hospital can be accomplished without removal; football helmet padding prevents head movement within the shell. As a general rule, the helmet and the chin strap should be left in place, and the face mask should be removed to aid in the assessment and maintenance of airway and breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because the shoulder pads in football elevate the player's shoulders in the supine position, removal of the helmet and the shoulder pads should occur at the same time. Otherwise, removal of the helmet but not the pads causes the head to drop out of the neutral, midline position. In addition, if the shoulder pads are removed but the helmet is not, the neck will be forced into flexion. Thus, the shoulder pads should <strong>not</strong> be removed if the helmet remains in place. This approach also applies to ice hockey and lacrosse players as long as the shoulder pads with helmet maintain the athlete&rsquo;s cervical spine in neutral position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When it is necessary to gain access to the athlete's face for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, airway management, or other reasons, the ACSM advises that only the face mask and chin strap be removed and the helmet left in place. A number of specifically designed tools can be used to remove the plastic bars that secure the face mask to the helmet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If no such tool is available, heavy duty trauma shears can be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To further minimize head motion, towel rolls, foam head blocks, and tape may be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite the general recommendation to keep football helmets in place, there are certain circumstances in which the helmet should be removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>], including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If motion restriction of the helmet does not immobilize the head (ie, if the helmet and chin strap do not hold the head securely).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If, even after removal of the face mask, the airway cannot be controlled, nor ventilation provided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the face mask cannot be removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the helmet prevents spinal motion restriction in an appropriate position for transport.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If helmet removal is necessary, it should be performed in a controlled manner. One person should stabilize the head, neck, and helmet, while a second person cuts the chin strap. Before removal of the helmet, accessible internal padding should be removed and air padding should be deflated. During this process, the chin and back of the neck must be manually stabilized and maintained in the neutral position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">When it is necessary to remove the helmet, the shoulder pads should be removed as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Shoulder pads also should be removed when multiple injuries require full access to the shoulder area, or when poorly fitting shoulder pads prevent proper spinal motion restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In 2015, the National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA) released a guideline that proposes removal of football equipment (helmet and shoulder pads) prior to transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. After review by membership and other organizations, this statement is undergoing revision. We disagree with removal of the football helmet and shoulder pads in the patient with a suspected neck injury prior to transport except in circumstances as noted above because it introduces motion into the spine which may convert a stable cervical spine injury into an unstable, more serious injury. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Helmets without shoulder pads</strong> &ndash; Helmets that are worn without shoulder pads (eg, batting helmets, bike helmets, motorcycle helmets) should be removed to permit motion restriction of the cervical spine in the neutral position. Failure to maintain a neutral position could result in serious damage to the cervical spinal cord in an athlete with an unstable cervical spine injury. Thus, when necessary, helmet removal should be performed by a health-care provider who has experience and expertise in helmet removal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When the athlete is clinically stable (eg, clear airway with normal breathing and circulation), waiting for EMS to arrive is better than attempted helmet removal by an inexperienced person.

If the jaw thrust maneuver fails to achieve adequate air exchange, an artificial airway must be obtained.

These vessels are most often injured in penetrating or high-velocity trauma to the head and neck. Such injuries are uncommon in sports, but when they occur, can be dramatic and life-threatening. In addition to laceration or rupture of these vessels in high-impact trauma, vessel dissection or thrombotic phenomena can occur as a result of intimal injury after seemingly mild trauma or forceful stretching of the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Vascular injuries of the neck can be difficult to diagnose, which may result in delay of definitive treatment. Thus, a high index of suspicion for such injuries must be maintained in athletes who sustain neck trauma during competition, particularly if there is severe bleeding from a penetrating neck wound.

Although it is unusual for an injured athlete who was initially evaluated on the sideline to require full spinal motion restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], it should be noted that a cervical collar alone does not adequately protect the cervical spine if the athlete has an unstable cervical fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thus, it is best to treat all neck injuries in which the clinical picture is not clear with full motion restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Prevention of secondary injury is the primary goal of prehospital and hospital care of the young athlete with acute neck injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Methylprednisolone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> in patients with spinal cord injury is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO PLAY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The athlete who is not transported may return to play when he or she is symptom-free and has a normal examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. Specifically, the patient should have no neck or extremity pain, no motor or sensory deficits or symptoms, no neck tightness or spasm, and full, pain-free range of cervical motion (actively and against hand resistance). The performance of a sport-specific functional sideline examination may be helpful in this assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/field-care-and-evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-acute-neck-injury/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although standardized guidelines for sport-specific sideline examinations have not been published, the authors recommend the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For football: Two 40-yard sideline sprints, two 40-yard zig-zag sprints, and blocking drills with a teammate. Reevaluate for neurologic symptoms and repeat physical examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hockey: Two sprints half the length of the ice, two zig-zags half the length of the ice, brief shooting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blocking drills with a teammate (if possible, this evaluation should be performed during stoppage of play, or on ice other than that being played on). Reevaluate for neurologic symptoms and repeat physical examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For gymnastics: The evaluation depends upon the event (eg, bars, floor, beam, vault, etc); the gymnast should be able to perform short, limited routines or portions of a routine at less than full speed with minimal difficulty. Reevaluate for neurologic symptoms and repeat physical examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For wrestling: Brief warm up (jogging, push-ups, etc) followed by brief, light sparring with a teammate. Reevaluate for neurologic symptoms and repeat physical examination.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every patient with an acute neck injury must be assumed to have a serious spinal cord injury until proven otherwise. The neck of a patient in whom a cervical spine injury is suspected must not be manipulated. No attempt should be made to move the athlete except as necessary to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or transportation to a medical facility. Before resuscitation or transport, motion of the cervical spine should be restricted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80228\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80228 \">algorithm 1</a>) until cervical spine injury is ruled out clinically or radiographically. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Suspicion and recognition'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During immobilization, the neck must be in a neutral position. As a general rule, athletes who are wearing a helmet and shoulder pads (eg, American football, ice hockey, and lacrosse players) should not undergo helmet removal because the shoulder pads worn in these sports elevate the shoulders adequately to maintain the neutral position. The face mask of such helmets must be removed to permit access to the airway. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Helmet removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helmets that are worn without shoulder pads (eg, batting helmets, bike helmets, motorcycle helmets) should be removed to permit motion restriction of the cervical spine in the neutral position. When helmet removal is necessary, it should be performed by a health-care provider who has experience and expertise in helmet removal. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Helmet removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once adequate airway, breathing, and circulation have been established, the athlete should be examined for symptoms and signs of cervical spine injury. Signs and symptoms of spinal cord injury include neck pain, numbness, dysesthetic pain, weakness, limited range of motion, paralysis, and loss of consciousness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76379\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76379 \">table 1</a>). An athlete with these findings should have his or her cervical spine immobilized (if not previously immobilized) and be transported for further evaluation. A cervical collar alone does not adequately protect the cervical spine if the athlete has an unstable cervical fracture. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Cervical spine evaluation in the ambulatory athlete'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because cervical spine injuries may evolve with time, the initial clinical picture may be deceptive, particularly in an athlete who is ambulatory. If the examining physician is unsure of the nature of the injury, he or she can keep the athlete out of competition and reevaluate. It is always safer to err on the side of caution because of the potential for catastrophic harm to the unstable cervical spine.
