Several small observational studies have demonstrated histologic changes of diversion colitis in the distal colonic segment of 70 to 100 percent of patients with fecal diversion, and endoscopic evidence in 70 to 91 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/4-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-11</a>]. Diversion colitis or proctitis is more common in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease (ie, Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis) than those with colon malignancy and diverticular diseases (See <a href=\"#H692051812\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopy and biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692056787\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diversion colitis typically occurs in diverted segments of the colon following surgery for congenital, inflammatory, or neoplastic disorders. Patients usually have a loop colostomy (or ileostomy) or an end colostomy (or ileostomy) with closure of the distal colon segment (eg, Hartmann's procedure). Diversion of the fecal stream results in a deficiency of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other luminal nutrients in colonocytes in the diverted segment of the colon. It is hypothesized that the lack of these compounds or interference with their metabolism by alterations in gut flora may have a role in the development of colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>SCFAs, predominantly acetate, propionate, and n-butyrate, are derived from anaerobic bacterial metabolism of unabsorbed dietary carbohydrates. They are absorbed from the lumen by a combination of simple diffusion and ion exchange and oxidized by colonocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition to supplying 70 percent of the fuel used by mucosal cells, luminal SCFAs have a number of other effects, including modulation of fluid and electrolyte transport, colonic motility, mucosal blood flow, and production of inflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Other luminal nutrients for colonocytes, such as glutamine, may also play a role in the pathogenesis of diversion colitis.</p><p>Detailed bacteriologic studies have also demonstrated that the diverted segment has fewer anaerobic flora and a higher percentage of nitrate-reducing strains than controls, which may in turn result in a lack of fermentation metabolites of carbohydrates and proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. However, no specific pathogens have been identified. In addition, the inconsistent response of certain patients to SCFAs in some studies and the response to restoration of fecal continuity suggest that other factors are involved in the pathogenesis of diversion colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Inflammation in the diverted segment of the large bowel may also set the stage for the development of symptomatic &quot;ulcerative colitis&quot;-like condition in the in-stream colon proximal to the diverted segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. This was illustrated in a report of two patients who had undergone sigmoid colostomies who developed diversion colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Neither had a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, but both patients later developed bleeding through the colostomy, with endoscopic and histologic features of ulcerative colitis in the previously normal colon proximal to the colostomy. It appears that both innate and adaptive immunities of diverted colon mucosa are altered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. A plausible hypothesis for the pathogenesis of proximal colitis is that leukocytes sensitized and activated in the vasculature of the diverted segment are recruited to the genetically susceptible proximal mucosa. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692051629\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fewer than 50 percent of patients with histologic evidence of diversion colitis have symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/4-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-11</a>]. In patients who are symptomatic, the onset usually occurs 3 to 36 months after colonic exclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The most common symptoms in adults are tenesmus, urgency, bloody <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mucus discharge, and abdominal pain. Symptoms are mild in up to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>]. In rare cases, patients have severe bleeding that requires transfusion, diarrhea, or sepsis from deep ulceration and marked mucosal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/11,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,27-30</a>].</p><p>The likelihood of symptoms may at least in part be associated with the underlying disease. In a series of 73 patients with a diverted colorectum, 87 percent of those with ulcerative colitis had symptoms as compared with 30 percent of those with Crohn disease, and 28 percent of those without inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a study of 36 children with Hirschsprung disease, only one child (3 percent) with an ileostomy for six years developed diversion colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. By contrast, in another study that included 14 children who underwent diversion because of chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, 11 (79 percent) developed diversion colitis between four months to seven years after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Persistent inflammation and long-term non-use may result in mild to severe stricture of the diverted bowel, especially in the diverted ileal pouch. In addition, accumulation of mucus materials may cause the formation of a bezoar. The stricture can cause symptoms of abdominal or pelvic pain and discomfort, and sensation of incomplete evacuation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F101840\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101840 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692051972\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of a patient with suspected diversion colitis serves to exclude other causes of colitis and establish the diagnosis of diversion colitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692054297\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diversion colitis should be considered in an individual with or without preexisting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who complains of cramping abdominal pain with a mucoid or bloody discharge from the defunctionalized, diverted distal colon. As the clinical manifestations, endoscopic and histologic findings of diversion colitis are nonspecific, the diagnosis requires exclusion of other disorders that can have similar clinical manifestations.

This includes a history of recent travel to areas endemic for bacterial or parasitic infections including amebiasis, recent antibiotic use that might predispose to an infection with <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, and a history of or risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases (eg, <em>Neisseria gonorrhea </em>and herpes simplex virus [HSV]) that are associated with proctitis. Atherosclerotic disease or prior ischemic episodes are suggestive of chronic colonic ischemia. A history of <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> radiation and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug <span class=\"nowrap\">(NSAID)/medication</span> exposure should be sought, as these may also be associated with colitis. In an immunocompromised patient, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can mimic ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease.

In more severe cases, patients may have ulcers, nodularity, edema, or inflammatory and filiform polyps and strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In some patients, endoscopy may show a &quot;cat scratch&quot; pattern with bright erythematous linear marks. The mucosa of diverted bowel is normally friable, even with gentle air insufflation. To minimize the risk of bleeding or perforation, insufflation with carbon dioxide, rather than room air, during endoscopy is preferred. In addition, deep or jumbo biopsy should be avoided.</p><p>Histopathological features of diversion colitis are not diagnostic, but biopsies of the colon are necessary to exclude other causes of colitis. The most common pathological features of diversion colitis include expanded lymphoid aggregates and inflammation in the lamina propria with lymphocytes and plasma cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53615\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53615 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].

In cases with marked lymphoid hyperplasia, the crypts may appear atrophic, short, and displaced by the lymphoid infiltrate imparting a false appearance of crypt architectural abnormalities of IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692051044\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to diagnose diversion colitis, it is important to distinguish it from other disorders that can have similar clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The clinical history provides important information to narrow the differential diagnosis but additional evaluation may be needed. There are distinct and shared features on clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features between ulcerative proctitis, chronic radiation proctopathy, and diversion proctitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F101839\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101839 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infectious colitis</strong> &ndash; Infectious colitis may have a similar clinical presentation and endoscopic appearance to diversion colitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67648 \">table 2</a>). Infectious colitis can be excluded with stool and tissue cultures, stool studies, and on biopsies of the colorectum.

In such cases, a response to a trial of short-chain fatty acid enemas is suggestive of diversion colitis. On the other hand, a favorable response to systemic corticosteroid or anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologics in a patient with diverted colorectum suggests the dominant role of underlying IBD in symptomatology.

Ischemia colitis is segmental in distribution with abrupt transition between injured and non-injured mucosa, and rectal sparing. A single linear ulcer running along the longitudinal axis of the colon may also be suggestive of ischemic colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Biopsies taken from affected areas may show nonspecific changes such as intra- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> submucosal hemorrhage, crypt destruction or crypt drop-out, capillary thrombosis, granulation tissue with crypt abscesses, and pseudopolyps, which may mimic Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]In the chronic phase of ischemic colitis, mucosal atrophy and areas of granulation tissue may be seen.

In this study, treatment with SCFA was not associated with an improvement in inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, most patients had severe inflammation by endoscopy and histology that might have been more consistent with the underlying IBD than with diversion colitis.</p><p/><p>It has been suggested that children diverted for reasons other than IBD seem to respond more consistently to SCFA enemas than adults; however, few observational studies have been published and the long-term response to SCFAs is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest topical 5-aminosalicylic acids (ASAs) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a>) in patients whose symptoms fail to improve after two to four weeks of treatment with SCFA enemas. In patients with diversion colitis who have underlying IBD, regardless of whether IBD involves the diverted segment, we use topical 5-ASAs in conjunction with SCFAs. Topical 5-ASAs are widely available as suppositories or enemas (eg, mesalamine suppository 1 gram twice daily, mesalamine retention enema 4 grams twice daily). However, evidence to support topical 5-ASA use in diversion colitis is limited to case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100554805\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of glucocorticoids should be limited to patients with diversion colitis who do not respond to or only partially respond to two to four weeks of therapy with SCFA enemas and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a>.

Topical steroids have not been systemically studied for the treatment of diversion colitis and their use is based on their efficacy in patients with other forms of colitis. In this author&rsquo;s experience, patients with diversion <span class=\"nowrap\">colitis/proctitis</span> along with underlying IBD may have a more favorable response to the topical glucocorticoid therapy than those without underlying IBD. However, it is important to note that adrenal suppression and other systemic adverse effects do occur in patients with long-term use of topical corticosteroids.

Therefore, surveillance for CRC in the diverted segment is not recommended unless the underlying condition for which the surgery was performed is associated with an increased risk of CRC (eg, preoperative diagnosis of CRC or a long history of IBD involving the colon and rectum). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance after colorectal cancer resection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-and-management-of-dysplasia-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Guidelines from major societies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100554830\"><span class=\"h1\">DIVERSION POUCHITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diversion pouchitis is a variant of diversion colitis that develops following an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) (eg, patients with ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90181\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90181 \">picture 4</a>) &#160; The first stage of the IPAA procedure often consists of total proctocolectomy, IPAA, and a diverting loop ileostomy, which is followed by a second-stage procedure (ie, loop ileostomy closure three to six months later) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. The first-stage of surgery results in temporary diversion of the fecal stream from the ileal pouch reservoir, which can lead to mucosal inflammation. In some patients with an ileal pouch, diversion may be permanent (eg, if they develop pouch failure due to refractory pouchitis or Crohn pouchitis), predisposing these patients to diversion pouchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diversion-colitis/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of diversion pouchitis are the same as diversion colitis. (See <a href=\"#H692051629\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H692051972\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diversion colitis is an inflammatory process that occurs in segments of the colorectum that are diverted from the fecal stream by surgery. (See <a href=\"#H692051703\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with diversion colitis have usually undergone a loop or end <span class=\"nowrap\">colostomy/ileostomy</span> with closure of the distal colon segment (eg, Hartmann&rsquo;s procedure). Diversion of the fecal stream results in a deficiency of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), along with other luminal nutrients needed by colonocytes in the diverted segment. It is hypothesized that the lack of these compounds or interference with their metabolism by alterations in gut flora may have a role in the development of colitis. However, the inconsistent response of patients to SCFAs and the almost uniform response to restoration of fecal continuity suggest that other factors are involved in the pathogenesis of diversion colitis. (See <a href=\"#H692056787\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with histologically evident diversion colitis are asymptomatic. The most common symptoms in adults are tenesmus, urgency, bloody <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mucus discharge, and abdominal pain. Symptoms are mild in up to 50 percent of patients. In rare cases, patients have severe bleeding that requires blood transfusion, diarrhea, or sepsis from deep ulceration. Persistent inflammation and long-term non-use may result in mild to severe stricture of the diverted bowel, especially in the diverted ileal pouch. In addition, accumulation of mucus materials may cause the formation of a bezoar. The stricture can cause symptoms of abdominal or pelvic pain and discomfort, and sensation of incomplete evacuation. (See <a href=\"#H692051629\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diversion colitis should be considered in an individual with or without preexisting inflammatory bowel disease who complains of cramping abdominal pain with a mucoid or bloody discharge from the defunctionalized, bypassed distal colon. Since the clinical manifestations of diversion colitis are nonspecific, the diagnosis requires exclusion of other disorders by history, laboratory studies, and colonoscopy with biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H692051972\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H692054297\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H692051044\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with symptomatic diversion colitis in whom restoration of intestinal continuity is feasible, we suggest reanastomosis as soon as possible after diversion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H692051245\" class=\"local\">'Surgical reanastomosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For symptomatic patients who are not candidates for reanastomosis, we suggest a trial of SCFA enemas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients who do not respond to a trial of SCFA enemas, we suggest the addition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> substitution with topical 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In patients who fail to respond completely to SCFA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> topical 5-ASA agents, we use topical corticosteroids. Topical glucocorticoids may be particularly useful in patients with underlying IBD. However, long-term use should be avoided to avoid steroid side effects. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk for the development of dysplasia or colorectal cancer (CRC) in the diverted colorectum in patients without a history of CRC or underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is low. We therefore do not perform routine CRC surveillance in the diverted segment unless the underlying condition for which the surgery was performed is associated with an increased risk of cancer (eg, preoperative diagnosis of CRC or a long history of IBD involving distal colon).
