As with other medical &quot;syndromes,&quot; there is controversy about the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition.</p><p>This topic will discuss the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients presenting with hyperventilation syndrome.

Many questions have been raised about the term &quot;hyperventilation syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some authors suggest that the term should be avoided, as it implies that hyperventilation is the primary cause of and trigger for a patient's symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Others cite that &quot;hyperventilation syndrome&quot; may at best describe multiple pathophysiologic processes rather than a unique, discrete clinical entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Nonetheless, &quot;hyperventilation syndrome&quot; is a term in wide use clinically and is descriptive of a common objective finding, ie, excess ventilation.</p><p>While it is generally accepted that hyperventilation episodes (or &quot;attacks&quot;) are frequently related to or caused by concomitant panic disorder, other precipitants may also be important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104941447\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of hyperventilation syndrome is difficult to assess accurately, as estimates are based upon small sample sizes, varying diagnostic criteria, and its association with psychological symptoms. There is substantial overlap between hyperventilation syndrome, panic disorder, and panic attacks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F83782\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83782 \">figure 1</a>)[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The prevalence of hyperventilation syndrome has been reported to range from 25 to 83 percent in patients with an anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/1,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panic-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Limited data suggest that hyperventilation syndrome occurs more commonly in women than in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>]. In an emergency department cohort study of 616 patients clinically diagnosed with hyperventilation, 55 percent of patients were female, the median age was 36.5 years (range 16 to 85), and 30 percent had had a prior episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H966850495\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychopathology</strong> &ndash; An association between hyperventilation syndrome and psychological pathologies (such as panic disorder) is clear, but whether the psychological condition is primary or secondary is often unclear. Both respiratory&nbsp;and somatic symptoms are common in patients with&nbsp;psychological distress. In a small study, patients with idiopathic hyperventilation syndrome had higher depression and anxiety scores than control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Specifically, &quot;disproportionate breathlessness&quot; is associated with depression, anxiety, bereavement, resentment, and uncertainty about the seriousness of one's illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, patients with anxiety disorder may react to sensations from the chest wall (eg, intercostal muscle tension) by hyperventilating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with anxiety may also complain of respiratory symptoms that can best be termed &quot;sighing dyspnea,&quot; in which patients feel as if they are not getting enough air or oxygen or &ldquo;as if I can&rsquo;t fill my lungs with air.&rdquo; Some describe a vague sub-xiphoid pressure sensation. This is described as &quot;periodic deep sighing&quot; in one review and as &quot;frequent sighing and irregular breathing patterns, sometimes overlapping with hyperventilation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis of panic disorder or other neuroses contributing to a patient's respiratory symptoms may be indicated by rapid shallow breathing, irregular respiratory patterns, sighing, and paroxysms of hyperventilation. These symptoms and the concomitant anxiety may be due to hyperventilation itself.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Regulatory systems</strong> &ndash; Abnormalities in&nbsp;ventilatory control are important in symptom development in some patients with hyperventilation syndrome. The reticular activating system in the brain stem, which regulates breathing patterns when individuals are awake, may be overactive in hyperventilation syndrome. Under normal conditions, healthy individuals demonstrate regular breathing with no voluntary effort. When asked to voluntarily increase minute ventilation, patients with hyperventilation syndrome may experience symptoms associated with hyperventilation syndrome. As an example, hyperventilation symptoms can be induced in such patients when they are instructed to breathe through a mouthpiece, while normal control subjects can do this, usually with an increase in ventilation, with no clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The inability of patients with hyperventilation syndrome to breathe comfortably through a mouthpiece may indicate an overactive reticular activating system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) or a hypersensitive fear network (the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and its brainstem projections) have also been proposed as mechanisms for the hyperventilation syndrome and its association with psychological symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. An activated hypersensitive fear network may result in an increased central respiratory drive, both as a manifestation of a &quot;fight or flight&quot; response and as a means to reduce arterial tension of CO<sub>2</sub> (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) levels and thereby decrease direct stimulation of the fear network. Sighing dyspnea may result from decreased sensitivity of alveolar stretch receptors that monitor inflation of the lung; typically, large tidal volume alleviates the dyspnea associated with disorders of the respiratory system characterized by increased airway resistance of decreased respiratory system compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The multiple repetitive sighing depth volume breaths may reflect an overly sensitive deflation reflex, triggered by a different set of stretch receptors, or failure to achieve normal relief from large tidal volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic symptoms</strong> &ndash; The mechanism by which hyperventilation causes symptoms such as paresthesias, headache, lightheadedness, and tetany is not well established. One hypothesis is that these symptoms may be due to local vasoconstriction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebral vasoconstriction. Cerebral blood flow decreases in a linear fashion with decreasing PaCO<sub>2</sub>: a decrease of 1 mmHg of PaCO<sub>2</sub> is associated with a 2 percent decrease in cerebral blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thus, a reduction in cerebral blood flow in the setting of hyperventilation, hypocapnia, and respiratory alkalosis may explain the neurologic symptoms associated with the hyperventilation syndrome such as paresthesias, headache, lightheadedness, and tetany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If true, these symptoms should rapidly respond to normalization of PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another proposed mechanism is that acute changes in ionized serum calcium levels, triggered by respiratory alkalosis and the consequent binding of calcium to albumin, could result in paresthesias <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tetany. There is no evidence (nor would it be anticipated) that hyperventilation results in changes in total serum calcium levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/13,14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,18</a>]. Hypophosphatemia has been noted in hyperventilating patients, however, and may contribute to tetany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vestibular and balance disorders may play an etiologic role for some patients with hyperventilation syndrome, accounting for symptoms of lightheadedness. Specifically, the distress associated with postural symptoms in the setting of vestibular pathology may also trigger hyperventilation. Furthermore, the vestibular system affects the activity of respiratory muscles in response to changes in body position. In patients with vestibular pathology, such responses may be exaggerated and result in inappropriate increases in ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary symptoms</strong> &ndash; An imbalance between sensory signals (from pulmonary and chest wall stretch receptors) and motor signals (from the motor cortex), called an efferent-afferent&nbsp;dissociation may be the cause of perceived dyspnea in hyperventilation syndrome; the greater the imbalance, the greater the severity of dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The sensation of&nbsp;dyspnea may then precipitate a voluntary increase in minute ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pulmonary symptoms in some patients diagnosed with hyperventilation syndrome may be due to unrecognized pulmonary pathology. Intermittent, mild, clinically unrecognized airway obstruction due to asthma may account for some cases of hyperventilation syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The difficulty in accurately diagnosing asthma, especially mild cases, contributes to delayed recognition of this diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104941454\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the presentation of hyperventilation syndrome can vary significantly among individuals, the typical pattern is that of intermittent episodes of spontaneously resolving hyperventilation. The cardinal feature of hyperventilation syndrome is a transient increase in minute ventilation, out of proportion to metabolic needs, that lasts several minutes to an hour and resolves spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. While the underlying process is hyperventilation, patients report a variety of somatic and nonsomatic complaints simultaneous to the increased respiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8373026\"><span class=\"h2\">Somatic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatic complaints associated with hyperventilation syndrome may include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea (60 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness or lightheadedness (13 to 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/9,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain or tightness (43 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paresthesias (35 to 60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/9,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations (13 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carpopedal spasm (9 percent)</p><p/><p>In one series, a minority of patients (17 percent) were aware that they were hyperventilating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Importantly, patients with hyperventilation syndrome are only intermittently symptomatic, and symptoms typically occur with unpredictable frequency.</p><p>Respiratory sensations associated with an acute episode may include dyspnea, air hunger, the sensation of an inability to inhale a complete breath, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a feeling of unsatisfying breathing (ie, a sensation that tidal volumes are too small despite each breath's volume being quite large). Patients experiencing an episode of hyperventilation syndrome typically will have a breathing pattern characterized by relatively slow, very deep breaths, sometimes punctuated by deep sighs. Patients with sighing dyspnea, which overlaps with hyperventilation, typically complain of &quot;shortness of breath,&quot; &quot;I can't get enough air or oxygen,&quot; or &quot;I can't fill my lungs with air,&quot; often with some vague chest discomfort and often with an anxiety component. The sighs are typically not perceived by the patients who may instead report difficulty taking a deep breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Unlike patients with pulmonary vascular disease, who typically complain of dyspnea that develops or worsens with exertion, patients with hyperventilation syndrome typically report dyspnea at rest and the need to sigh frequently.</p><p>Paresthesias are a common symptom in hyperventilation syndrome. Carpopedal spasm was described in the original clinical reports of hyperventilation attacks and is still considered a feature of the syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Its presence may depend on the severity of hyperventilation, to the extent that carpopedal syndrome may be triggered by alkalosis-induced metabolic changes or cerebral vasoconstriction associated with hypocapnia. (See <a href=\"#H966850495\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Additionally, patients with hyperventilation syndrome who develop symptoms with voluntary hyperventilation or exercise typically experience delayed resolution of respiratory symptoms after exercise compared with normal subjects. Furthermore, the intensity of exertion may not correlate with the degree of dyspnea experienced by patients with hyperventilation syndrome; relatively minimal exertion may result in significant dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8373033\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychological symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodes of acute hyperventilation are associated with anxiety and other psychologic symptoms. Patients with hyperventilation may report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/9,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sense of impending doom, panic (30 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety and fear (95 percent in one large study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>])</p><p/><p>In a small series that used a formal interview instrument (Clinical Interview Schedule) to assess psychologic symptoms, 17 of 23 patients (78 percent) exceeded the threshold for anxiety or panic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In many patients, these symptoms reflect a primary psychological pathology that is the cause of hyperventilation. In other patients, anxiety and somatoform symptoms are a result of hyperventilation and the accompanying metabolic changes that cause systemic disturbance. Fear was present in over 95 percent in one emergency department series of 616 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

However, episodes may occur randomly or without an obvious precipitant. One case series evaluated psychological and emotional events in the three years prior to presentation in 31 patients with a clinical diagnosis of hyperventilation syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Many of these patients described events or feelings of bereavement, uncertainty about the seriousness of their symptoms, or resentment towards the medical profession because the cause of their symptoms was unexplained and they felt that their symptoms were minimized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4197017599\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical physical examination findings in a patient with hyperventilation syndrome include tachycardia, tachypnea, deep breathing, sometimes diaphoresis, and sometimes carpopedal spasm. The cardiopulmonary examination should otherwise be normal, unless the patient has hyperventilation superimposed on asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p>Sighing dyspnea is a related form of dysfunctional breathing that is characterized by deep sighs (more than three times normal tidal volume) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>].

These conditions need to be considered early in the evaluation of a patient who presents with dyspnea and appears to be hyperventilating. The differential diagnosis is broad (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111013 \">table 1</a>); the following are some of the processes that can be misinterpreted as hyperventilation syndrome during the early evaluation of patients presenting with hyperventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is important to note, however, that the following differential primarily represents causes of acute hyperventilation, which is a clinical and pathophysiologically distinct process from the recurrent, episodic hyperventilation that defines hyperventilation syndrome.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolic acidosis</strong> &ndash; Disorders that cause metabolic acidosis can lead to compensatory respiratory alkalosis achieved by hyperventilation. Examples include diabetic, alcoholic, or starvation ketoacidosis; severe renal failure; toxic ingestions or exposures (especially those that lead to abnormalities in cellular respiration); and lactic acidosis of any cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77464\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77464 \">table 2</a>). Kussmaul breathing, which is relatively deep and slow, is characteristic of both hyperventilation syndrome and the respiratory response to metabolic acidosis. One should note, however, that most of the conditions associated with an increased anion gap, with the exception of chronic renal failure, are acute in nature and would not be associated with chronic hyperventilation. A general approach to metabolic acidosis is provided separately.

Laboratory evaluation to determine the cause of metabolic acidosis generally includes serum electrolytes and calculation of the anion gap, but may require additional testing in complicated patients (eg, plasma osmolality, urinalysis, urine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serum ketones, and blood and urine toxicology screens).

Clues to the presence of heart failure include orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, an irregularly irregular rhythm, peripheral edema, and a history of cardiac disease, as well as crackles on chest exam, increased jugular venous distension, and peripheral edema. Diagnostic assessment usually includes an ECG, a serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP; or N-terminal pro-BNP [NT-pro-BNP]) level, cardiac biomarkers, a chest radiograph, and, depending on the results to these tests, an echocardiogram.

This is done by a combination of assessment of risk factors for PE, examination for evidence of hemodynamic compromise (eg, tachycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100/minute),</span> and measurement of pulse oximetry, and D-dimer in appropriate patients. The majority of patients with PE have a widened alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, in contrast to patients with hyperventilation syndrome in whom gas exchange is generally normal. The decision to obtain computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography is based on the likelihood of PE according to probability scores or overall clinical suspicion.

Depending on the size of the pneumothorax, physical findings of decreased chest excursion on the affected side, diminished breath sounds, and hyperresonance to percussion may be absent. Pulse oximetry may show decreased oxygen saturation, but oxygen saturation may be normal in a patient with otherwise normal lungs. A chest radiograph, or thoracic ultrasound by a trained clinician, is needed to exclude the diagnosis.

Asthma is a common comorbid disease among patients with hyperventilation syndrome, and such patients are often unable to differentiate the two causes of &quot;dyspnea.&quot; The presence of wheezing favors a diagnosis of asthma but must be differentiated from PVFM. The latter is more often an inspiratory phenomenon, associated with audible stridor, and the oxygen saturation will usually be normal. Patients with PVFM can &quot;pant&quot; during an episode, whereas asthmatic patients cannot. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy during the attack is diagnostic, the key finding being that the vocal cords come together during inspiration, especially posteriorly, rather than move apart from the midline. Measuring peak expiratory flow or forced expiratory volume in one second can help in the assessment of asthma exacerbations but are dependent on patient effort and technique.

Generally, other features, such as cough, sputum production, and &gt;20 pack-year smoking history, provide clues to the diagnosis. It is also important to remember that tachypnea or hyperventilation from any cause in the setting of airflow obstruction (eg, COPD) may lead to dynamic hyperinflation and associated physiological changes that will cause or worsen dyspnea.

Lack of response to bronchodilators, monophonic wheeze, and inspiratory stridor are clues to upper airway obstruction, but their absence does not exclude this diagnosis. In addition, such patients may have arterial blood gas evidence of respiratory acidosis without an increased alveolar-to-arterial gradient.

Patients with cirrhosis have difficulty metabolizing lactic acid, so infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can present with increased ventilation in response to metabolic acidosis. Identification of symptoms and signs suggesting infection (eg, fever) or specific to an infectious source (eg, productive cough, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms) and knowledge of underlying disorders can help lead to the correct diagnosis.

If the seizure was not witnessed, such patients could present with hyperventilation, although this would almost always be associated with decreased mental status. Patients with partial seizures can also present with attacks that suggest panic attacks and which can be associated with hyperventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Finally, brainstem pathology, usually tumors or inflammation in the pons, can be associated with central hyperventilation syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104941489\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperventilation syndrome is a disorder with no widely accepted diagnostic criteria; it is a diagnosis of exclusion that is made after careful observation and evaluation of alternate explanations for the symptoms and findings and is usually reserved for patients with a pattern of recurrent episodes without other signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The combination of the patient's presentation, absence of findings to support an alternative diagnosis, and symptom resolution may be sufficient to diagnose hyperventilation syndrome in the majority of cases. However, the challenge to the clinician is that for patients presenting acutely with hyperventilation, a number of respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic, and infectious illnesses are in the differential diagnosis and must be excluded clinically or with further testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111013 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H33834810\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>The overlap of cardiopulmonary conditions and emotional conditions that are associated with hyperventilation should be kept in mind. As examples, hyperventilation syndrome is well described in patients with known asthma, and panic disorder is sometimes associated with hyperventilation.</p><p>Having excluded physiologic causes for hyperventilation, one is often left with a syndrome that may be characterized by features of a number of psychological and behavioral disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F83782\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83782 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104941496\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperventilation syndrome may be suspected in a young (eg, &lt;40 years old), well-appearing patient with rapid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deep respirations and a history of subacute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic symptoms, but no prior history of cardiopulmonary disease. However, to make the diagnosis of hyperventilation syndrome, alternative etiologies need to be considered and excluded. The patient history, physical examination, and screening laboratory testing should focus on these potential alternative etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H33834810\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnostic approach to a patient with suspected hyperventilation syndrome depends on the clinical suspicion for an alternate diagnosis (based on bedside assessment) and the patient's response to reassurance. For a young, otherwise healthy and well-appearing patient whose symptoms resolve and vital signs normalize quickly with reassurance, a diagnostic evaluation beyond a careful history, physical, and pulse oximetry may not be needed.

Patients whose symptoms are not intermittent should not be considered as having hyperventilation syndrome. The absence of reproducible exertional symptoms may be helpful in excluding chronic pulmonary disease. Key points of the history in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute dyspnea are described separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111012\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111012 \">table 3</a>).

Fever and hypoxemia should not be seen with hyperventilation syndrome and must also be explained with alternative mechanisms. In addition, the patient should be examined for signs of significant respiratory distress, such as use of accessory muscles, inability to lie flat, distended jugular veins, profound diaphoresis, or altered mental status. Other physical findings that would suggest a cause other than hyperventilation include signs of dehydration, goiter, new loud murmur, S3 gallop, pericardial rub, abdominal tenderness, or new peripheral edema. If any of these are present, particular care should be taken to exclude causes of dyspnea and hyperventilation due to alternative diseases.

A patient's symptoms are assessed <strong>after</strong> voluntary hyperventilation and compared with the symptoms experienced by the patient during spontaneous &quot;attacks.&quot; Compared with normal subjects, minute ventilation may be elevated and normalization of PaCO<sub>2</sub> after voluntary hyperventilation may be delayed in patients with hyperventilation syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The HVPT has several limitations, however, and its clinical utility is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/2,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,38,39</a>]. One study reports that in a randomized trial the HVPT was positive in 85 of 115 subjects with suspected hyperventilation (74 percent), but that 56 of the 85 also had a positive placebo test (in which CO<sub>2</sub> levels were maintained during overbreathing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Additional testing that could be considered in the evaluation of hyperventilation syndrome includes cardiopulmonary exercise testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] and dyspnea questionnaires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/33,34,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34,41-43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104941517\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is scant evidence regarding the effectiveness of treatments for patients with hyperventilation syndrome, either during an acute episode or for management of recurrent symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13784838\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate management of patients who are hyperventilating due to hyperventilation syndrome should focus on patient reassurance, an explanation of the symptoms the patient is experiencing, removal of any stressors, and encouragement to breathe at a normal rate and tidal volume. If these are unsuccessful, the patient may be given a small dose of a rapidly acting benzodiazepine.</p><p>Rebreathing of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by breathing into a paper bag may lead to improvement in the symptoms of hyperventilation syndrome by normalizing arterial tension of CO<sub>2</sub> (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) levels, but it can cause significant hypoxemia and consequent complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Although this technique has long been used, there are no studies of the efficacy of this traditional treatment and we do not recommend it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Should this technique be pursued, it should only be employed following a clear determination that the patient is not experiencing an acute hypoxic or cardiac event and does not have a metabolic acidosis. Oxygen saturation should be continuously monitored during rebreathing via pulse oximetry.</p><p>Episodes of hyperventilation generally resolve without complications. However, there are <strong>very rare</strong> case reports of post-hyperventilation apnea that have been associated with severe hypoxemia and even death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13784878\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment to prevent recurrent episodes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive</strong> <strong>behavioral therapy</strong> &ndash; The cornerstone of treatment for hyperventilation syndrome is cognitive behavioral therapy and education. Patient education regarding the nature of the disease process and breathing retraining may provide significant benefit to affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Breathing retraining, which focuses on enhancing a patient's awareness of breathing pattern and strategies to normalize the pattern when symptoms occur, is most commonly performed in the setting of pulmonary rehabilitation but may also be a component of psychiatric and cognitive behavioral therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults#H157308639\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychotherapy for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults&quot;, section on 'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults#H3450346188\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Breathing retraining</strong> &ndash; Limited evidence indicates that breathing retraining can have both short- and long-term effects on improving hyperventilation syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Long-term effects were demonstrated in a three-year observational study of 10 patients who underwent rebreathing training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, a 2013 systematic review of breathing exercises for hyperventilation syndrome found only one small randomized trial of rebreathing training and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of breathing exercises to treat hyperventilation syndrome and recommended that clinical trials be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta-blockers </strong>&ndash; The evidence in favor of beta-blocker therapy is mixed. Some studies of beta blockers have demonstrated short-term improvement in the frequency of hyperventilation episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In one randomized trial over three weeks, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisoprolol</a> 5 mg once daily led to a 75 percent decrease in the frequency of hyperventilation episodes (from four to one per week), compared with a 12.5 percent decrease (from 4.0 to 3.5 per week) with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, a retrospective study of beta blockers compared with benzodiazepines and anxiolytics demonstrated no effect of either therapy on subjective complaints, and dissociation between subjective complaints and measurements of ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Both beta blocker and sedatives were equivalent in raising the PaCO<sub>2</sub>; side effects were less frequent with beta blockers. Beta blockers carry the risk of exacerbating underlying asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> &ndash; Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed for patients with overlapping psychological <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychiatric symptoms and hyperventilation syndrome. However, there are limited efficacy data on hyperventilation syndrome with or without&nbsp;psychological symptoms. One small study demonstrated no efficacy of benzodiazepines compared with breathing retraining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. 40 consecutive patients were randomly assigned to treatment with breathing retraining, benzodiazepines, or &quot;hyperventilation provocation&quot; (breathing into a plastic bag every day for two to four weeks), or they were assigned to a control group on drug therapy. There was a significant reduction in the frequency and severity of hyperventilation episodes in all treatment groups, and there were no differences in effectiveness among these groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperventilation-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</strong> &ndash; Although beneficial in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress syndrome, there are no studies of the efficacy of selective SSRIs in the treatment of hyperventilation syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults#H5614705\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104941524\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperventilation syndrome is characterized by intermittent episodes of transient increases in minute ventilation associated with a wide range of symptoms without an alternative, contributory cardiorespiratory diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H104941440\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of symptoms, including dyspnea, lightheadedness, paresthesias, chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, fear and sense of impending doom, and anxiety, have all been associated with hyperventilation syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H104941454\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychological, neurologic, and cardiopulmonary pathologies may all contribute to a patient's symptoms. There is significant overlap with psychiatric comorbidities (especially panic and anxiety disorders) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F83782\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83782 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H104941447\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperventilation syndrome is a disorder with no widely accepted diagnostic criteria; it is a diagnosis of exclusion that is made after careful observation and evaluation of alternate possibilities. (See <a href=\"#H104941489\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of acute hyperventilation includes multiple serious and potentially life-threatening medical conditions, such as metabolic acidosis, asthma, upper airway obstruction, pulmonary embolism (PE), acute coronary syndrome, and sepsis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111013 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H33834810\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F111012\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111012 \">table 3</a>), physical examination, and screening laboratory testing should focus on potential alternative etiologies for patients presenting with acute hyperventilation. The evaluation is step-wise, with results of initial history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and response to treatment guiding subsequent testing. (See <a href=\"#H104941489\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acute management of a hyperventilation episode due to hyperventilation syndrome should focus on patient reassurance. Paper bag rebreathing carries the risk of hypoxemia and is <strong>not</strong> advised. If used, acute cardiopulmonary etiologies should have been excluded, and close observation with pulse oxygen monitoring should be employed. (See <a href=\"#H13784838\" class=\"local\">'Acute management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients who are diagnosed with hyperventilation syndrome, who are not felt to have an underlying anxiety or panic disorder, be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy focused upon breathing retraining (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13784878\" class=\"local\">'Treatment to prevent recurrent episodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral to a pulmonologist for specialty testing is only necessary in complicated diagnostic cases, in patients with multiple comorbidities, or for patients who are refractory to standard interventions. Referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist may be appropriate for patients with recurrent episodes.
