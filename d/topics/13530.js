A systematic review concluded that five patients with GAD would need to be treated with antidepressants (rather than placebo) for one patient to achieve a clinical response (ie, number needed to treat = 5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>As an example, the largest trial compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> at two fixed doses (20 and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> with placebo in 566 patients with GAD. After eight weeks of treatment, both doses of paroxetine resulted in a greater reduction of anxiety symptoms than placebo (62 and 68 percent versus 46 percent, respectively).

Our clinical experience has been that they work for a much longer time in this chronic condition.</p><p>SSRIs can produce side effects that interfere with the patient&rsquo;s quality of life and medication adherence. Thus, side effects need to be recognized and managed early in treatment. Individual SSRIs vary in their side effect profile, but common side effects include sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal abnormalities (nausea and diarrhea), insomnia and withdrawal on discontinuation. SSRIs can cause drug interactions, weight gain, and agitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperactivation.

As an example, a clinical trial first treated 44 patients with GAD with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> (a benzodiazepine) for five weeks and then randomly assigned them to receive 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of buspirone or placebo, with a tapering off of the benzodiazepine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. After eight weeks, patients receiving buspirone experienced reduced anxiety symptoms compared with placebo, and comparable to lorazepam. Buspirone had fewer side effects compared with lorazepam.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=buspirone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Buspirone</a>&rsquo;s time to onset is longer than benzodiazepines&rsquo; and similar to the antidepressants&rsquo; average of four weeks. In our experience, it has a weaker anxiolytic effect than benzodiazepines. These factors have limited its use by psychiatrists largely to augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for GAD, though it remains a popular treatment for GAD among primary care practitioners. Buspirone can be used as monotherapy (in the absence of comorbid major depression) or for augmentation at doses of 10 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F77409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77409 \">table 2</a>).

Pregabalin inhibits calcium currents via high-voltage-activated channels containing the a2d-1 subunit, though the relationship of this mechanism to its efficacy in GAD is not known. It was approved in 2006 for the treatment of anxiety in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Pregabalin is not approved for treating GAD by the US Food and Drug Administration. The doses for pregabalin range from 50 to 300 mg, though many patients may need a total daily dose of greater than 150 mg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F77409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77409 \">table 2</a>). Side effects include sedation and dizziness. Tolerance, withdrawal, and dependence are possible, but pregabalin is generally better tolerated than benzodiazepines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F77409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77409 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72104732\"><span class=\"h1\">BENZODIAZEPINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines have been found to be efficacious in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), generally leading to a reduction of emotional and somatic symptoms within minutes to hours, depending on the specific medication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65653\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65653 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. However, concerns about risks of dependence and tolerance have contributed to a decline in their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/10,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21</a>]. A large observational study of treatment of United States patients with GAD (without comorbidity) found that between 1989 to 1991 and 1996 benzodiazepine use declined and antidepressant use increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>While benzodiazepines should be used with caution, and avoided in patients with a history of a substance use disorder, their use need not be entirely avoided. They may be used for acute, maintenance, or long-term treatment of GAD, either as monotherapy or, more commonly, as an adjunct to antidepressant treatment. Benzodiazepines are most commonly used in GAD for acute management of anxiety and worry during the period before selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors take effect. They can counteract the initial agitation often caused by the SSRI. Once the patient responds to the SSRI, the benzodiazepine can be tapered off gradually. Antidepressants are preferred over benzodiazepines when depression, a common comorbidity of GAD, is also present, because antidepressants are effective treatments for both conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with chronic GAD, minimal current depressive symptoms, and no history of a substance use disorder are candidates for long-term, low-dose benzodiazepine treatment if antidepressants are ineffective or poorly tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Some patients respond well to chronic treatment with benzodiazepines, do not develop tolerance to their anxiolytic effects, which would require dose increase and experience only mild, tolerable withdrawal symptoms when the medication is tapered off. Patients who develop rapid tolerance, increase their doses against medical advice, or exhibit withdrawal symptoms between doses are not good candidates for chronic benzodiazepine treatment.

GABA receptors are membrane-bound proteins divided into three subtypes, GABAA, GABAB, and GABAC receptors. The GABAA receptors are composed of five subunits that together form the chloride channel, which primarily mediates neuronal excitability (seizures), rapid mood changes, clinical anxiety, and sleep. GABAB receptors mediate memory, mood, and analgesia. The role of the GABAC receptors remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Flumazenil</a>, a benzodiazepine antagonist, interacts with GABAA receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] and is used clinically to rapidly reverse the effects of benzodiazepine overdoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].
