Lectins are involved in complement activation via the lectin pathway. The complement system provides immediate defense against infection and has proinflammatory effects; it is considered part of both the innate and adaptive immune systems.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the genetic defects and polymorphisms of the <em>MBL2</em> gene and the function of the MBL protein. The diagnosis of MBL deficiency, diseases associated with both low and high levels of MBL, and other aspects of the complement system are discussed separately.

However, in humans, the MBL1 gene, <em>MBL1P1</em>, is a pseudogene (ie, it does not produce a functional protein) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The two MBL genes are most likely the result of a gene-duplication event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The gene encoding functional MBL in humans, <em>MBL2</em>, is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q11.2-q21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The <em>MBL2</em> gene is also known as collectin subfamily member 2 or COLEC2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The human MBL protein is encoded by four exons. The <em>MBL2</em> gene also contains an extra exon approximately 1 kb upstream of exon 1, named exon 0, which may initiate transcription of the <em>MBL2</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Gene expression is primarily regulated by several consensus elements in the promoter region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The normal allele is called allele A. To date, three point mutations have been identified, all in exon 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allele B &ndash; Codon 54, GGC to GAC (Gly_Asp)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allele C &ndash; Codon 57, GGA to GAA (Gly_Glu)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allele D &ndash; Codon 52, CGT to TGT (Arg_Cys)</p><p/><p>The wild-type is denoted <em>MBL2</em> genotype <span class=\"nowrap\">A/A,</span> and the pooled MBL variants (B, C, and D) are denoted <em>MBL2</em> genotype <span class=\"nowrap\">0/0</span> (where the &quot;0&quot; stands for one of the variant alleles).</p><p>The MBL variant proteins are unstable and probably have a shorter half-life in the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In addition, all mutations in exon 1 interfere with the formation of higher order oligomers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The variant MBL has a lower molecular weight and does not bind mannan efficiently nor activate complement. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'The MBL protein'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to the three mutations in exon 1, there are several other polymorphic sites located in the MBL promoter region that are associated with decreased MBL serum concentration. These include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located at position -550 <span class=\"nowrap\">(H/L</span> variant) and -221 <span class=\"nowrap\">(Y/X</span> variant), both G to C nucleotide substitutions. Another polymorphic site is located at position +4 of the 5'-untranslated portion of the <em>MBL2</em> gene <span class=\"nowrap\">(P/Q</span> variant, C to T). The promoter haplotypes, HY, LY, and LX are associated with high, medium, and low levels of MBL serum concentrations, respectively. In addition, a low producing LX haplotype in the homozygous state seems to downregulate the basal expression of MBL as effectively as a single structural variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The molecular mechanisms resulting in different MBL serum levels associated with the <em>MBL2</em> gene promoter types have not yet been elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/12,13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,15</a>].</p><p>Four common haplotypes have been identified on a normal A chromosomal background: HYPA, LYPA, LYQA, and LXPA, with high, high-intermediate, intermediate, and low promoter activity. The variant alleles are associated with HYPD, LYPB, and LYQC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/4,13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13,15</a>]. Thus, seven common haplotypes are found. Other haplotypes have been described but are rare due to linkage disequilibrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The serum level of MBL is strongly associated with the individual's haplotype.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THE MBL PROTEIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal lectins that are dependent upon the presence of calcium ions are named C-type lectins. Members of the C-type family include selectins, hepatic type II receptors, type I transmembrane proteins, collectins (collagen-like lectins), and lecticans.</p><p>The collectins include three serum proteins (MBL, bovine conglutinin, and bovine collectin 43) and two lung surfactant proteins (SP-A and SP-D) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. These proteins play important roles in innate immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system#H9421023\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;, section on 'Collectins'</a>.)</p><p>The MBL protein consists of multimers of an identical 25 kDa polypeptide chain synthesized by the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Three polypeptide chains form a triple helix within the collagen-like region. These structural subunits form covalent oligomers via disulfide bonds at the N-terminal end. MBL in serum primarily consists of trimers and tetramers of 9 and 12 polypeptides respectively, but the oligomers can range from dimers to hexamers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These higher-order oligomers are necessary for the function of MBL and the interaction with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>MBL binds carbohydrates in the presence of Ca2+ through the C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/17,18,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,25</a>]. The CRD is able to form bonds with hydroxyl groups on specific ligands, including mannose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc), N-acetyl-mannosamine, fucose, and glucose. These carbohydrates are found on pathologic micro-organisms, including bacteria, fungi, parasitic protozoans, and viruses. CRD also recognizes molecular structures of dying host cells, including nucleic acids, mitochondria, and the metalloproteases, meprin-alpha and -beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>]. Carbohydrates that are found on mammalian glycoproteins, such as D-galactose and sialic acid, have no affinity for MBL. Thus, MBL is able to bind to microbes or unwanted material and trigger the activation of the lectin pathway, but it avoids recognition of self.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">THE LECTIN PATHWAY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complement system can be activated through three pathways: the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the lectin pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60513\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60513 \">figure 1</a>). The lectin pathway has an activation scheme similar to that of the classical pathway, but lectins substitute for antibodies and an associated protease replaces C1. MBL and related collectins bind sugar residues on the microbial surface; their associated proteases (MBL-associated serine proteases [MASPs]) subsequently cleave C4 and C2. The complement activation pathways are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MBL DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, individuals generally benefit from normal levels of MBL. However, in some cases, low levels appear to be advantageous. The association of both decreased and elevated serum levels of MBL due to different polymorphisms of the <em>MBL2</em> gene and its promoter with a variety of diseases is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mannose-binding lectin deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a protein involved in complement activation via the lectin pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60513\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60513 \">figure 1</a>).
