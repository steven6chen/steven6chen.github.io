In addition, a drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis or, with aminoglycosides, acute kidney injury (due to acute tubular necrosis) can develop as a result of treating the infection.

Approximately one-third of patients developed acute kidney injury (of any cause), a complication observed most often among older patients and those with <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> infection. In a separate series of patients with IE-associated GN, acute kidney injury was the most common clinical presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-the-setting-of-infective-endocarditis-or-an-infected-ventriculoatrial-shunt/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features and renal biopsy findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common organism in IE-associated GN is <em>S. aureus</em>, which is seen in 56 percent of cases; <em>Streptococcus </em>species are the next most common. Less common organisms include <em>Bartonella henselae</em>, <em>Coxiella burnetii</em>, <em>Cardiobacterium hominis</em>, and <em>Gemella</em>. In 9 percent of patients with IE-associated GN, no organism could be cultured. One-half of affected patients do not have a known risk factor; in the remainder, common comorbidities included cardiac valve disease (30 percent), intravenous drug use (29 percent), hepatitis C (20 percent), and diabetes (18 percent). The cardiac valve infected was tricuspid in 43 percent, mitral in 33 percent, and aortic in 29 percent of patients in the largest series described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-the-setting-of-infective-endocarditis-or-an-infected-ventriculoatrial-shunt/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There are a few case reports of patients with IE and GN who developed pulmonary hemorrhage, potentially mimicking other systemic diseases such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis and antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) autoantibody disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-the-setting-of-infective-endocarditis-or-an-infected-ventriculoatrial-shunt/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

Features of the acute nephritic syndrome were seen in a minority (10 percent), as was nephrotic syndrome (6 percent); 53 percent of patients had reduced C3 complement, and 19 percent had reductions in C4 complement, suggesting activation of the alternative complement pathway. ANCA (usually directed at myeloperoxidase or lactoferrin) may be positive in up to one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-the-setting-of-infective-endocarditis-or-an-infected-ventriculoatrial-shunt/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; some patients also have a positive rheumatoid factor, and rare patients are positive for anti-GBM autoantibodies.</p><p>In the largest series, crescentic GN was the most common pattern seen on renal biopsy specimens by light microscopy (53 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F111391\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111391 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-the-setting-of-infective-endocarditis-or-an-infected-ventriculoatrial-shunt/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Diffuse proliferative GN was also a common finding (33 percent), and focal proliferative GN and mild mesangial proliferative GN were seen in a few patients. In addition to GN, the majority of patients showed tubular injury (86 percent) and interstitial inflammation (88 percent). By immunofluorescence microscopy, C3 was present in 94 percent of cases, immunoglobulin staining was observed in less than one-third of biopsies, and IgA-dominant (or codominant with IgG) staining was seen in 17 percent. A significant proportion of biopsies met the criteria for pauci-immune GN by immunofluorescence (44 percent). On electron microscopy, 90 percent of biopsies showed deposits, most commonly in the mesangial area (84 percent), followed by the subendothelial area (45 percent). Only a minority had subepithelial &quot;humps,&quot; which are deposits that are classically seen in infection-related GN (14 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of IE is usually suggested from the history, cardiac examination, and positive blood cultures. The diagnosis of IE is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with IE and acute kidney injury or an abnormal urinalysis, GN is suspected based upon urinary findings. However, GN must be distinguished from other renal diseases that can occur in the setting of endocarditis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug-induced interstitial nephritis, usually with a penicillin, cephalosporin, or quinolone, shares many of the clinical findings of acute GN: hematuria (occasionally, but not usually, with red cell casts), mild proteinuria, and renal insufficiency. Pyuria and white cell casts can be seen in both disorders but are typically the major finding in acute interstitial nephritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The distinction between these disorders can usually be made from the <strong>timing</strong> of the renal manifestations. Glomerular involvement is typically near or at its peak of severity just before the institution of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. By contrast, acute interstitial nephritis is a later event, generally requiring 10 or more days of drug treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-the-setting-of-infective-endocarditis-or-an-infected-ventriculoatrial-shunt/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. If present, eosinophilia and eosinophiluria also point toward this disorder. Recurrent fever may be seen and may erroneously suggest failure of antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aminoglycoside-induced acute tubular necrosis also occurs late (after at least five to seven days of therapy) and is associated with different urinary findings from either the GN or interstitial nephritis. The urinalysis can vary from a bland sediment to one showing multiple muddy brown granular casts, renal epithelial cells, and epithelial cell casts.

The mechanism of renal injury probably involves persistent antigenemia derived from an infectious agent with subsequent immune complex formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-the-setting-of-infective-endocarditis-or-an-infected-ventriculoatrial-shunt/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].
