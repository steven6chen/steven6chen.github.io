In a case-control study of 76 patients who died of a cardiovascular cause within 30 days of elective surgery, a preoperative history of hypertension was four times more likely than among 76 matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The issues regarding the perioperative management of the patient with hypertension are reviewed here.

These responses may be more pronounced in patients with untreated hypertension in whom the systolic blood pressure can increase by 90 mmHg and the heart rate by 40 beats per minute.</p><p>The mean arterial pressure tends to fall as the period of anesthesia progresses due to a variety of factors, including direct effects of the anesthetic, inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system, and loss of the baroreceptor reflex control of arterial pressure. These changes can result in episodes of intraoperative hypotension. Patients with preexisting hypertension are more likely to experience intraoperative blood pressure lability (either hypotension or hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], which may lead to myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Blood pressure and heart rate slowly increase as patients recover from the effects of anesthesia during the immediate postoperative period. Hypertensive individuals, in particular, may experience significant increases in these parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIOPERATIVE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HYPERTENSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preexisting hypertension can induce a variety of cardiovascular responses that potentially increase the risk of surgery, including diastolic dysfunction from left ventricular hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction leading to congestive heart failure, renal impairment, and cerebrovascular and coronary occlusive disease. The level of risk is dependent upon the severity of hypertension.</p><p>However, much of the evidence for the impact of preoperative hypertension comes from uncontrolled studies performed before contemporary (more effective) management was available. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether postponing surgery to achieve blood pressure control will lead to reduced cardiac risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines list uncontrolled hypertension as a &quot;minor&quot; risk factor for perioperative cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An early study found that patients with untreated severe hypertension (mean systolic and diastolic pressures of 211 and 105 mmHg, respectively) had exaggerated hypotensive responses to the induction of anesthesia and marked hypertensive responses to noxious stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with well-controlled hypertension responded similarly to normotensive subjects. Other studies have found that a diastolic pressure over 110 mmHg immediately before surgery is associated with a number of complications including dysrhythmias, myocardial ischemia and infarction, neurologic complications, and renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=possible-prevention-and-therapy-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Possible prevention and therapy of ischemic acute tubular necrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild to moderate hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with less marked hypertension (diastolic pressure less than 110 mmHg) do not appear to be at increased operative risk. This was illustrated in a study of 676 operations involving a general anesthetic in patients over the age of 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Subjects were divided into five groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normotensive patients (group I, no medications; group II, on diuretics for nonhypertensive reasons) were significantly less likely to experience perioperative hypertension than patients who were normotensive on medication (group III), who were hypertensive despite treatment (group IV), and who had untreated hypertension (group V) (8 and 6 versus 27, 25, and 20 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with inadequately treated or untreated hypertension (groups IV and V) were no more likely to experience cardiac complications than normotensive patients not taking diuretics (group I).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with a history of hypertension (groups III, IV, and V), multivariate analysis identified only two independent risk factors for cardiac complications: the preoperative cardiac risk index score (which does not include hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57075\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57075 \">table 1</a>)); and marked reductions in intraoperative blood pressure (a decrease to less than 50 percent of preoperative levels or a decrease of 33 percent or more for more than 10 minutes).</p><p/><p>These results suggest that elective surgery in patients with hypertension does not need to be delayed as long as the diastolic blood pressure is less than 110 mmHg and intraoperative and postoperative blood pressures are carefully monitored to prevent hypertensive or hypotensive episodes. On the other hand, when hypertension has caused end-organ disease such as congestive heart failure and renal insufficiency, the probability of adverse cardiac outcome in the perioperative period increases significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The impact of systolic hypertension on operative risk is less clear. One study of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy found that a systolic pressure greater than 200 mmHg was associated with an increased risk of postoperative hypertension and neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients with isolated systolic hypertension are at increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity after coronary artery bypass surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with suspected secondary hypertension should ideally undergo a diagnostic evaluation prior to elective surgery (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of secondary hypertension&quot;</a>). However, most patients are not at increased perioperative risk as long as the hypertension is not severe and serum electrolytes and renal function are normal. An important exception is the patient with pheochromocytoma, in whom operative mortality may be as high as 80 percent in unsuspected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

However, we typically hold angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for a period of 24 hours prior to surgery. A more complete discussion of perioperative medication management is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following is a brief summary of recommendations for the various classes of antihypertensive drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients in whom chronic diuretic therapy has caused hypokalemia may have potentiation of the effects of muscle relaxants used during anesthesia, as well as predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias and paralytic ileus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Such drugs can theoretically blunt the compensatory activation of the renin-angiotensin system during surgery and result in prolonged hypotension. Several studies have reported a higher incidence of hypotension in patients who took ACE inhibitors or ARBs prior to undergoing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. As an example, one study of 150 vascular surgery patients found that the incidence of hypotension during anesthetic induction was significantly lower in patients who stopped taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> on the evening before surgery than in those who took the medication on the morning of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A high incidence of severe hypotension in patients on an ARB who underwent general anesthesia has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Calcium channel blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients receiving calcium channel blockers may have an increased incidence of postoperative bleeding, probably due to inhibition of platelet aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-hypertension/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, with the exception of beta blockers and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, it is not necessary for patients who are unable to resume oral medications to continue the same class of drugs postoperatively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goal blood pressure in patients treated for postoperative hypertension is similar to the general population. In patients treated for postoperative hypertension who did not have preexisting hypertension, we discontinue antihypertensive therapy once the patient is surgically stable and the blood pressure is at goal for at least 24 hours.
