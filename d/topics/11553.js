Approximately 10 percent of adults have neck pain at any one time. The majority of patients, regardless of the cause of pain, recover with conservative therapy. Pain severity may not correlate with abnormalities seen on imaging of the neck.</p><p>This topic review discusses the causes, evaluation, and available treatments for the most common types of neck pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NECK ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neck, or cervical spine, is formed by seven square-shaped bones (cervical vertebrae), which are stacked one on top of another. The vertebrae are named for their position in the neck, beginning at the top with C1, C2, C3, and down to C7. The skull and upper cervical vertebrae are uniquely connected to facilitate movement of the skull. The difference in shape of the atlas (C1) and the axis (C2) allow the upper part of the atlas vertebrae to support the rounded condyles that are at the occipital base of the skull. Together with the supporting ligaments and the overlying long neck muscles, the cervical vertebrae form a strong spinal canal that surrounds and protects the spinal cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69175\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69175 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Between the neck bones are discs, which function as shock absorbers, cushioning one bone from another. Applying excessive pressure to the disc causes the inner gelatin-like material to protrude through its outer capsule; this is called a herniated disc. Other words used to describe such disc issues include &quot;bulging,&quot; &quot;protruding,&quot; &quot;extruding,&quot; &quot;slipped,&quot; or &quot;ruptured.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Cervical radiculopathy'</a> below.)</p><p>Directly covering the bones and the discs is a dense layer of taut ligaments. These thick tissues are attached directly to the bones and function to limit the movement of one cervical vertebra against the other. Car accidents and injuries to the head or body can cause injury to these ligaments. This whiplash movement of the neck can range in severity from minor bruising to complete tear and separation of ligament from the bone. This whiplash type of motion and involvement of the neck is important to consider when assessing the neck after a concussion is sustained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major muscles of the neck form the next protective layer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63871\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63871 \">figure 2</a>). These muscles are responsible for holding the head upright, maintaining normal posture, and supporting and moving the neck. Overuse and irritation of these muscles are generically called neck strain or muscle tension. Given their location and attachments, these can also contribute to headaches, termed &ldquo;muscle tension headaches.&rdquo; There are also small muscles between the vertebrae.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NECK PAIN CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several possible causes of neck pain, although it is often difficult to know with certainty what is causing pain. This is because the examination, and even imaging tests, are not able to easily differentiate among the various causes. It is important to understand that the severity of the degenerative change has no clear correlation with the degree of pain, disability, or trajectory of symptoms. Since many of the anatomic causes of pain cannot be changed, it is more important to work on the modifiable factors which include posture, muscle strength, sleep, proper teeth and mastication alignment, and mental tension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical strain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical muscle strain can occur when there is an injury to the muscles of the neck, causing spasm of the cervical and upper back muscles. Cervical strain may result from the physical stresses of everyday life, including poor posture, muscle tension from psychologic stress, or poor sleeping habits. The mechanism of injury in sports concussions can also result in cervical strain. Typically, cervical strain symptoms include pain, stiffness, and tightness in the upper back or shoulder, which may last for up to six weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical spondylosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical spondylosis is a condition caused by abnormal wear and tear (called degenerative changes) of the cervical spine. Wear-and-tear causes gradual narrowing of the disc space, a loss of the normal square-shaped bone, and growth of the edges of the bone (bone spurs). These spurs can increase pressure on the surrounding tissues. Up to 90 percent of pinched nerves in the neck are caused by bone spurs. Some degree of wear and tear is normal with aging, although severe degenerative changes are not normal.</p><p>Symptoms of cervical spondylosis can include neck pain or weakness, numbness or abnormal sensations of the arms or shoulders, headaches, or limited ability to move the neck. Ear pain has been associated with upper cervical spondylosis to a lesser extent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical discogenic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical discogenic pain may be the most common cause of neck pain. It is caused by changes in the structure of one or more of the cervical intervertebral discs. Common symptoms of discogenic pain include pain in the neck when turning or tilting the head. Pain may be worsened when the neck is held in one position for prolonged periods, such as occurs with driving, reading, or working at a computer. There is often associated muscle tightness and spasms. Discogenic pain can also refer pain or odd sensations into the arm or shoulder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical facet syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The facet joint, which is located on the left and right side of the vertebrae, is the most commonly affected area in whiplash-related neck pain and headaches. Another potential cause of cervical facet syndrome includes a job that requires a person to repeatedly extend the neck (tilt the head backwards). Symptoms of cervical facet syndrome include pain in the middle or side of the neck; some people also notice pain in the shoulders, around the shoulder blades, at the base of the head, into the ear and jaw, or in one arm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Whiplash injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cervical whiplash syndrome is caused by a traumatic event that causes an abrupt <span class=\"nowrap\">forward/backward</span> movement of the cervical spine. The most common cause of whiplash is a motor vehicle accident. Additionally, in sports-related concussion, a whiplash type of injury can occur when there is a significant blow to the body and the neck has to control the motion of the head. Symptoms of whiplash include severe pain, spasm, headaches, ear pain, jaw pain, and loss of range of motion in the neck.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical myofascial pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myofascial pain causes tight and tender areas of muscle that are sensitive to pressure. Myofascial pain in the neck can develop after trauma or with other medical conditions, such as psychologic stress, depression, or insomnia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diffuse skeletal hyperostosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a syndrome in which there are abnormal calcifications in the ligaments and tendons along the cervical spine, causing these tissues to become hardened. Many people with DISH have no symptoms while others develop stiffness, loss of mobility, and pain. This condition can also involve the thoracic (middle) and lumbar (lower) spine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical spondylotic myelopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical spondylotic myelopathy occurs when there are degenerative changes that narrow the central (middle) spinal canal. This narrowing can injure the cervical spinal cord or cause it to function improperly. In addition to pain and loss of motion, signs of cervical spondylotic myelopathy may include a variety of neurologic complaints. Weakness, difficulty walking or coordinating movement, inability to empty or control the bowels or bladder, and sexual dysfunction (eg, erectile dysfunction) may occur as a result of irritation of the spinal cord.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical radiculopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical radiculopathy occurs when a nerve root is irritated by a protruding disc, arthritis of the spine, or a mass that compresses a nerve (eg, a synovial cyst). Signs of radiculopathy can include pain, weakness, or changes in sensation (eg, numbness, pins and needles) in the arms. The most common causes of cervical radiculopathy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degenerative changes related to aging or injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Herniation of a cervical disc</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">NECK PAIN TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is helpful to determine the cause of a person&rsquo;s neck pain. An evaluation with a health care provider is recommended for anyone with a severe head or neck injury, inability to control the bowels or bladder, severe pain, or numbness or changes in sensation in the arms or legs, or if pain does not begin to improve after one week with treatment at home.</p><p>The evaluation of neck pain usually begins by observing the person's ability to move the head to the left and right, forward and backward, and side to side. The health care provider will observe the posture and movement of the neck and shoulders and will palpate the muscles in the neck, head, upper back, and shoulders to detect areas of pain or tension. The provider will also perform strength, sensation, and reflex testing to detect any problems.</p><p>In some cases, further testing, such as an x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or electrodiagnostic testing (EMG or electromyography) will be recommended. The need for these tests depends upon the person's age, symptoms, medical history, and examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">NECK PAIN TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, neck pain can be treated conservatively with over-the-counter pain medications, ice, heat, massage, and strengthening <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stretching exercises at home. If pain or movement restrictions do not improve after a few weeks of conservative treatment, further evaluation is usually recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain relief</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acetaminophen (eg, Tylenol and others) or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication (eg, ibuprofen, naproxen) may be helpful to relieve mild to moderate neck pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For people with severe muscle spasm, a muscle relaxant may be recommended. For people with severe neck pain, a tricyclic antidepressant may also be recommended. Both tricyclic antidepressants and muscle relaxants can cause a person to feel sleepy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Ice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For some people, ice can reduce the severity of neck pain. It can be applied directly to the sore area of the neck. Ice can be frozen in a paper cup, and then the upper edge of the cup can be torn away. The ice should be moved continuously in strokes on the neck muscles for five to seven minutes.</p><p>Other options for the application of cold to control sudden onset muscle tightness include placing a bag of ice, bag of frozen peas, or a frozen towel to the painful area. The cold source should be wrapped in a thin dry cloth layer before it is placed on the neck to protect the skin. The skin can become injured with excessive use of ice, especially in those with poor skin sensation. The skin should be inspected with each ice application for changes in pigmentation (eg, lighter- or darker-colored areas) and any changes should be reported to a health care provider. The ice should be left in place for 15 to 20 minutes to deeply penetrate the tissues; this can be repeated every two to four hours until symptoms improve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Heat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heat can help to reduce pain in the neck. Moist heat can be applied for 10 to 15 minutes in a shower, hot bath, or with a moist towel warmed in a microwave. It is important to avoid overheating the towel and potentially injuring the skin, especially in people with poor skin sensation. The skin can become pigmented (discolored) in a blotchy pattern in people who use heat frequently.</p><p>In general, acute injuries utilize ice as the initial treatment, especially if swelling is present. Heat may be used initially for patients who have cold intolerance to ice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Massage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Massage can be helpful for relieving muscle spasm and can be performed after heating or icing the neck. Massage can be done with the hands by applying pressure to both sides of the neck and the upper back muscles, or with an electric hand-held vibrator. The neck muscles should be relaxed during massage by supporting the head or lying down. There are different types of massage, and people may differ in their tolerance of the pressure used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Stretching exercises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The range of motion of the neck must be restored and preserved after an injury; this is done with exercises that stretch and strengthen the neck muscles. Range of motion exercises and stretching may help decrease pain from muscle injury. It is best to perform stretching exercises when the muscles are warm, such as after the application of heat, or after a few minutes of cardiovascular warm-up exercises.</p><p>Exercises can be performed in the morning to relieve stiffness and again at night before going to bed. Expect mild, achy muscle pain if you are new to exercise. A sharp or electric pain in the shoulder or arm is not normal and should be reported to a health care provider.</p><p>Do not attempt to perform these exercises if you have a pinched nerve in the neck, especially if there is pain or numbness into the arm and hand, unless recommended by a health care provider. While these exercises can dramatically improve symptoms of a pinched nerve, they can actually make the problem worse if performed improperly.</p><p>The most useful stretching exercises for the neck include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck bending &ndash; Tilt the head forward and try to touch your chin to your neck. This motion is more of a &ldquo;nod.&rdquo; Hold for a few seconds, breathe in gradually, and exhale slowly with each exercise. Exhaling with the movement helps relax the muscles. Repeat 10 to 15 times. Relax the neck and back muscles with each neck bend.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoulder rolls &ndash; In the sitting or standing position, hold the arms at the side with the elbows bent. Try to pinch the shoulder blades together. Roll the shoulders backwards 10 to 15 times, moving in a rhythmic, rowing motion. Proper neck alignment posture is important during this exercise. Rest. Roll the shoulders forwards 10 to 15 times.</p><p/><p>Other exercise may include neck rotation, neck tilting, vertical shoulder stretches, upper back stretches, and back bending.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck rotation &ndash; Slowly look to the right. Hold for a few seconds. Look to the center. Rest for a few seconds between movements. Repeat 10 to 15 times. Perform on the left side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck tilting &ndash; Look straight forward, then tilt the top of the head to the right, trying to touch your right ear to the right shoulder (without moving the shoulder). Hold in place for a few seconds. Return the head to the center. Repeat 10 to 15 times. Repeat on the left side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertical shoulder stretches &ndash; In the sitting or standing position, use the right hand to hold the left wrist and pull the arm (and shoulder) up and over the head, towards the right. Hold for five seconds. Keep the left shoulder and back muscles relaxed. Rest and repeat 10 to 15 times. Repeat using left hand to hold right wrist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper back stretches &ndash; In the standing position, lean forward from the hips and rest both hands on a low counter with the elbows straight. Exhale, relax the neck and shoulders, and allow the head to fall forward as you round the upper back. This requires the shoulder blades to spread apart and mimics the motion of a cat stretching its back. Exhaling with the motion helps to relax the muscles. Return to the standing position with hands on a counter. Repeat slowly 10 times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper back side bends &ndash; Stand or sit up straight in a chair. Bend the trunk to the right while holding the hands together slightly behind the neck for support. Hold for five seconds, and then return to center. Repeat to the left. Repeat 10 to 15 times. Keep the lower back straight or supported against a chair. Remember to inhale and exhale through the abdomen and not hold your breath.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduce stress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emotional stress can increase neck tension and interfere with or delay the recovery process. Reducing stress may help to prevent a recurrence of neck pain. Relaxation techniques can relieve musculoskeletal tension. An example of a relaxation exercise is to take a deep breath in, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale completely. Breathe normally for a few seconds, and then repeat.</p><p>Other activities that may help to reduce stress include meditation, mindfulness-based stress reduction programs, cognitive behavioral therapy, progressive muscle relaxation, prayer, hypnosis, or biofeedback.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Posture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activities and body positions that prevent or reduce neck pain include those that emphasize a neutral neck position and minimize tension across the supporting muscles and ligaments of the neck. Extremes of range of motion, activities, and body positions that cause constant tension should be minimized or avoided:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sitting in the same position for prolonged periods of time. Take periodic five minute breaks from the desk, work station, etc. Avoid looking up or down at a computer monitor; adjust it to eye level. Visual changes or new prescriptions can also affect positioning of <span class=\"nowrap\">neck/head</span> as adjust posture to read.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid placing pressure over the upper back with backpacks, over-the-shoulder purses, or children riding on your shoulders. Alternatives may include wheeled backpacks or cases, handbags, and having a child walk or ride in a stroller.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not perform overhead work for prolonged periods at a time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain good posture by holding your head up and keeping your shoulders back and down. Pay attention to neck and arm position during cellphone use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use the car or chair arm rests to keep the arms supported. Find the optimal seated alignment in your car for your entire spine and note neck position with car head rests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep with your neck in a neutral position by sleeping with a small pillow under the nape of your neck (sleeping on your back) or sleeping with enough pillows to keep your neck straight in line with your body (sleeping on your side). If you sleep on your back, putting a pillow under the knees can help to flatten the spine and relax the neck muscles. Avoid sleeping on the stomach with the head turned.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carry heavy objects close to your body rather than with outstretched arms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER NECK PAIN TREATMENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Acupuncture and biofeedback</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acupuncture involves inserting hair-thin, metal needles into the skin at specific points on the body. It causes little to no pain. Biofeedback involves learning to control certain bodily functions, such as muscle tension, which can help to decrease pain.</p><p>Acupuncture and biofeedback have been used in patients with persistent neck pain with cervical muscle strain. The quality of many of these studies is insufficient to draw firm conclusions regarding their efficacy. One review found that acupuncture may help to relieve chronic neck pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neck-pain-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical collar</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A soft cervical collar is a piece of foam covered with fabric that is worn around the neck to support the head. Routine use of a cervical collar is not recommended because it may delay recovery or allow the neck muscles to weaken. In addition, collars can make neck pain worse in some people due to the fit of the collar.</p><p>At night, a rolled towel under the neck or a neck pillow can provide comfort and keep the neck in a neutral position. The ear should be aligned with the middle of the shoulder when lying on the back. When lying on the side, the nose should be aligned with the middle of the chest bone. Using one or two regular pillows is not recommended because it can cause too much forward or side-bending of the neck.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trigger point injections consist of dry needling, in which the needle is directed in many directions into areas of tenderness, knots, and spasms (trigger point), followed by injection of a local anesthetic medication (eg, lidocaine).</p><p>Trigger point injections may be recommended if other treatments (eg, stretching exercises, massage) do not significantly improve pain. However, there is no good evidence that trigger point injections help to reduce pain or speed healing in the long term. Trigger point injections with steroids into the neck muscles are not routinely recommended due to the risk of injury to the muscles and lack of additional benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrical stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a treatment that uses a mild electric current, which is applied to the skin, to decrease pain and increase mobility and strength. Studies of TENS are poorly designed and it is not clear if the treatment is effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neck-pain-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, a trial of TENS is reasonable if other forms of treatment are not successful. A health care provider can teach the patient how to perform TENS at home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Chiropractic or physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of neck pain by physically handling the muscles, soft tissue, and joints can be performed by several qualified health care professionals, including clinicians, physical therapists, and chiropractors. This type of treatment may include massage, heat, ultrasound, or electrical stimulation.</p><p>Some studies have found that treatments that include quick &quot;thrusting&quot; of the neck are associated with serious injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neck-pain-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Aggressive manipulation or adjustments to the cervical spine should be discouraged in older adult patients and those with cervical stenosis. Other treatments that include gentle movement or massage may be safe and helpful for many people, especially when it is combined with stretching and strengthening exercises.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H448121838\"><span class=\"h2\">Alexander technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternative intervention, taught by licensed teachers in Alexander technique, has had some success with decreasing neck pain. Through individual instruction of changing movement habits and posture, the patient can learn to identify areas of muscle tension and repetitive muscle fatiguing movement patterns that contribute to muscular pain and imbalance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical traction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical traction involves the use of weights to realign or pull the spinal column into alignment. Clinical studies have shown that there is no benefit to traction in the treatment of neck pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is not useful for treating most types of neck pain. However, surgery does have a role in relieving symptoms related to a pinched nerve caused by a herniated disc (cervical radiculopathy or cervical spondylotic myelopathy) after a trial of conservative therapy (eg, stretching exercises, physical therapy). People with chronic neck pain who do not improve with the above treatments may benefit from referral to a spine or pain specialty clinic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=715\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
