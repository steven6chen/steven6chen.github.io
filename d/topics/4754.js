It is the most common monogenic disorder in non-Hispanic whites of Northern European descent, with a carrier frequency of <span class=\"nowrap\">1/24</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/25</span> and birth prevalence of 1 in 2500. Carrier screening is offered to couples planning pregnancy or in early pregnancy to identify those at risk of conceiving a child with classic CF.</p><p>This topic will review CF carrier screening and reproductive options for carrier couples, including prenatal diagnosis. Other issues related to CF are discussed separately, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CF MUTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CF is caused by mutations in a single large gene on chromosome 7 that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which regulates chloride channel function of epithelial cells of the sweat gland, airway, pancreas, and intestine. Clinical disease occurs when disease-causing mutations are present in both copies of the <em>CFTR</em> gene. Over 1900 different mutations in the CF gene have been identified, although the vast majority of <em>CFTR</em> mutations occur at frequencies less than <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000</span> (&lt;0.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The specific mutations that an individual carries are a major determinant of clinical severity. The range of clinical expression likely reflects the degree to which protein function is changed by the mutation, modulation of the phenotype by other genes, and variation in susceptibility to environmental factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344023054\"><span class=\"h2\">CFTR mutation prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutation types and carrier frequencies vary among populations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58715\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58715 \">table 1</a>). The highest carrier rate is in non-Hispanic whites of Northern European descent, of whom 1 in 25 carries a <em>CFTR</em> mutation; the most common mutation is <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F508,</span> which accounts for 70 to 75 percent of all CF cases in this population. Native Americans also have a high <em>CFTR</em> mutation carrier frequency: 1 in 31 among the Pueblo people and 1 in 20 among the Zuni, but the <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F508</span> mutation is not common in these groups. <em>CFTR</em> mutation carrier frequency in Hispanics is 1 in 46.</p><p>In individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, <em>CFTR</em> mutation carrier frequency is 1 in 24. The most common mutations are W1282X, <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F508,</span> G542X, 3849+10kb C&gt;T, and N1303K, which together account for 94 to 97 percent of CF cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. W1282X is the most common mutation causing classic CF in this group, accounting for 46 percent of all CF cases.</p><p>For individuals with ethnic origins in Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, or Libya, <em>CFTR</em> mutation carrier rates range from 1 in 24 to 1 in 29; for those with ethnic origins in Iran or Iraq, the carrier rate is 1 in 90.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prepregnancy or prenatal carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis of CF have several potential benefits:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents can be educated about CF before the birth of an affected child, and can better prepare for its birth. Such preparation is largely psychological, since the management of labor and delivery is not changed by the prenatal diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents at increased risk of having a child with CF can be identified so that they can make an informed decision about their reproduction options. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Reproductive options for carrier couples'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prenatal diagnosis of CF allows the pediatricians caring for the neonate to perform additional tests that might recognize a CF-related problem earlier. For example, prenatal diagnosis of CF in fetuses with hyperechoic bowel can facilitate diagnosis and treatment of neonatal meconium ileus, which is the earliest clinical manifestation of CF, occurring in 10&nbsp;to 20 percent of fetuses with the disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, most newborns with CF are asymptomatic; without neonatal screening for CF, the average age at diagnosis is 2.9 years. All 50 states include CF in their newborn screening panel; therefore, waiting for results from neonatal screening is another reasonable option for carrier couples who definitely would not terminate an affected pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Newborn screening is less costly than prenatal diagnosis and avoids the small risk of pregnancy loss associated with invasive procedures for definitive fetal diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Meconium ileus and distal ileal obstruction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H59099793\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Newborn screening'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is possible that, in the future, early detection of the CF mutation may provide an opportunity for in utero gene therapy.</p><p/><p>Prenatal risk assessment is limited in some ethnic groups because the specific mutations responsible for CF in these groups are incompletely understood or unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, many people are of mixed ancestry, making selection of an appropriate panel of mutations for screening difficult. Although CF screening provides an opportunity to obtain important information about a current or future pregnancy, the information can also provoke significant and prolonged anxiety because of the inability to reliably predict phenotype after a positive screen, the inability of a negative screen to reliably exclude clinical disease in all cases, and the improving prognosis for individuals with CF (median survival &gt;50 years for individuals born after 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]). Another source of anxiety is that once a family member is identified as carrying a CF mutation, other family members may learn that they are at increased risk even though they might not have wanted this information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CANDIDATES FOR SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We offer CF screening to all couples actively planning pregnancy and all pregnant women regardless of personal or family history, in accordance with guidelines from several professional organizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,10</a>]. Counseling and screening are ideally performed before conception, but can be done in the first or early second trimester.</p><p>Couples in whom one or both partners have a personal or family history of CF (first-degree relative [son, daughter, sibling, mother, father] or second-degree relative [aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, grandparent]) are at high risk of carrying a CF mutation.</p><p>Non-Hispanic whites of Northern European or Ashkenazi Jewish descent also have high carrier rates <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/24</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/25)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58715\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58715 \">table 1</a>), whereas African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans have low carrier rates <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/61,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">1/58,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">1/94,</span> respectively). Because mixed ethnicity is common, it is reasonable to offer CF carrier screening to all couples. However, it is important that all couples understand that CF screening is most accurate for non-Hispanic whites of Northern European descent and those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent since a high proportion of disease in these groups is attributable to common identifiable mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55196\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55196 \">table 2</a>). Individuals of other ethnic backgrounds may not benefit from current CF screening tests if their carrier rate is low or if common CF-causing mutations have not been identified in their ethnic group and therefore are not included in the screening panel. For this reason, couples of ethnicities with low carrier rates may decide to forego testing. (See <a href=\"#H344023117\" class=\"local\">'Negative screen'</a> below.)</p><p>In couples who decline preconception or early pregnancy carrier screening, visualization of echogenic bowel in the second trimester, particularly with dilated bowel and a nonvisualized gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], is another indication for offering parental screening or, for carrier couples, fetal diagnostic testing. Sonographic evidence of echogenic fetal bowel in the second trimester has been associated with CF (risk of approximately 1 percent), as well as other fetal disorders. This topic is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-echogenic-bowel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal echogenic bowel&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344022607\"><span class=\"h1\">CARRIER TEST SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends offering preconception or prenatal CF screening to all women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Because over 1900 different mutations in the CF gene have been identified, it is not possible to screen for all known mutations. The key to effective CF screening is determining which mutations should be included in the screening panel. This requires knowledge of the most common <em>CFTR </em>mutations in the general population and in individuals of specific ethnic groups. For couples with an affected family member, it requires knowledge of the specific mutations identified in that relative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H434305174\"><span class=\"h2\">Standard panel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most CF testing laboratories screen for a specific panel of mutations with a frequency of at least 0.1 percent in the North American population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; the current standard CF screening panel includes 23 of the more common mutations in this group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65637 \">table 3</a>). Although the standard panel performs well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], sensitivity varies in different populations. The following carrier detection rates by <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> group have been reported for this panel in the United States: Ashkenazi Jews (94 percent), non-Hispanic whites (88 percent), Hispanic whites (72 percent), African Americans (64 percent), Asian Americans (49 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among these groups, Asian Americans have the lowest proportion of detectable mutations and the lowest birth prevalence of CF, which makes them least likely to benefit from prenatal carrier testing.</p><p>In two situations, additional &quot;reflex&quot; testing will also be done. If the test identifies <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F508</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F507,</span> the result could be a false positive due to variant codons at positions 506, 507, or 508. Accordingly, when <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F508</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F507</span> are identified, the sample is specifically tested for the variant codons I506V, I507V, and F508C to clarify the risk of having the full CF phenotype. Identification of a variant suggests a false positive. Reflex testing is also done when the R117H mutation is identified. This mutation can cause classic CF if it is on the same chromosome as a mutation consisting of an intronic poly-T tract, called the 5T variant, located in a noncoding region of the CF gene, <strong>and</strong> there is a CF mutation on the other chromosome. The outcome of the R117H with other poly-T sizes (7T, 9T) and a second disease-causing CFTR mutation can be quite variable, ranging from no symptoms to mild lung disease. However, if an R117H mutation is on one chromosome and the 5T variant is on the other chromosome, or any of several other arrangements, and the fetus is male, the likelihood of having congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) is significantly increased (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81257\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81257 \">table 4</a>). To resolve these possibilities, when R117H is identified, additional testing for the <span class=\"nowrap\">5T/7T/9T</span> variants is performed and, if possible, the <span class=\"nowrap\">cis/trans</span> location of the alleles is determined.</p><p>Additional information on genetic testing for carriers can be obtained from the <a href=\"http://www.cff.org/&amp;token=bmTq7ZuIcyocF4e9UyYv8gN0xUdpqx98Oi7BGt9iuCY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=463\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H434305180\"><span class=\"h2\">Expanded panel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For individuals of non-white, non-Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicities, an expanded screening panel could theoretically provide a higher carrier detection rate than the standard panel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, determining which CF mutations to add to the standard panel can be difficult since, in these populations, CF mutation types and frequencies and their clinical significance are not well understood. For this reason, commercially available pan-ethnic expanded panels may not have higher sensitivity than the standard panel, and may include mutations of unclear clinical significance, which make prediction of the phenotype of offspring problematic. (See <a href=\"#H344024802\" class=\"local\">'Prediction of phenotype'</a> below.)</p><p>In cases in which the standard screening panel has identified a CF mutation in one partner, some clinicians offer the expanded panel to the other partner to improve identification of couples at risk of having an affected child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H434305291\"><span class=\"h2\">CFTR sequencing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>CFTR</em> sequencing is not appropriate for routine carrier screening, but may be a reasonable option if the patient has a family history of CF, but family test results are not available, and they are either of an ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white of North European ancestry or have had a negative standard carrier screening test result. Full genomic sequencing is the most thorough method for identifying CF mutations; however, even genomic sequencing cannot identify all CF mutations. One study of individuals with CF reported that, in approximately 10 percent of cases, the responsible CF mutations could not be identified after comprehensive <em>CFTR</em> analysis that included <span class=\"nowrap\">deletion/duplication</span> analysis and extensive sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the past, the main drawback to <em>CFTR</em> sequencing was the cost, so it was used primarily for cases in which an individual met clinical criteria for CF but standard screening did not identify CF mutations. Many genetic testing companies now offer <em>CFTR</em> sequencing at a price comparable with or lower than the cost of the standard or expanded screening panel, although the cost of the test may not be covered by all insurance carriers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING STRATEGIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344022705\"><span class=\"h2\">Couples with no personal or family history of CF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The least expensive and probably most widely used screening strategy is to screen the woman only. The risk of an affected child is calculated based on her positive or negative test result (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71503\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71503 \">table 5</a>) and the background carrier rate for her partner's ethnicity. Some couples will be reassured by this estimate and will not request partner screening, especially if the only goal of screening is to determine if the child is at high risk of being affected. This approach is also appropriate when the father is unavailable for testing or is unknown.</p><p>The next least expensive screening strategy (called serial screening) is to screen the woman first. If the woman is screen-negative, the child is assumed to be at low risk and the partner is not offered screening. If she is screen-positive, her partner is screened using the standard panel, and the risk of an affected child is then calculated. For partners whose ethnicity requires testing for less common mutations, an expanded panel or CFTR sequencing may improve sensitivity.</p><p>The most expensive, accurate, and efficient approach is to screen both members of the couple at the same time (called couple screening). This method is most appropriate for couples who need to know their risk for an affected child rapidly and cannot wait for results from serial screening, for couples who want the most accurate risk assessment for an affected child, and for couples who want to inform their siblings that they may be CF mutation carriers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344022263\"><span class=\"h2\">Couples with a personal or family history of CF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, when a family member has confirmed CF, other family members should be screened by the same laboratory that tested the affected relative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The screening panel should include familial mutations previously identified as well as the mutations in the standard panel.</p><p>If a specific gene mutation has not yet been identified in the affected family member and <em>CFTR </em>sequencing has not been done, <em>CFTR</em> sequencing should be arranged. If the affected family member had no or incomplete prior CF testing and is not available for testing, <em>CFTR</em> sequencing should be offered to the member of the couple who is related.</p><p>If results from any of these testing methods show that one partner is a CF carrier, the other partner should be tested by the standard panel of the most common CF mutations in his or her ethnic group or, if appropriate, by an expanded mutation pane or <em>CFTR</em> sequencing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26009219\"><span class=\"h2\">Father unavailable</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the father is unavailable for testing or is unknown, only the woman is screened.

When 100 non-Hispanic white couples of Northern European ancestry who are true carriers are tested for <em>CFTR</em> mutations that account for 90 percent of all CF cases (the standard screening panel): In 81 couples both partners will be correctly identified as carriers, in 18 couples only one partner will be correctly identified as a carrier, and in one couple neither partner will be correctly identified as a carrier.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344022458\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION OF SCREENING RESULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The screening test report should list the mutations in the screening panel and provide a post-test interpretation of the individual's residual carrier frequency based on ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The residual carrier frequency indicates the fetal status based on the screening test results, the incidence of CF in the patient&rsquo;s ethnic group, and consideration that the panel does not include all CF mutations. The possibility of de novo fetal <em>CFTR</em> mutations is not considered because they have never been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The following discussion applies to screening results for couples with no personal or family history of CF and no fetal abnormalities associated with CF on ultrasound examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344023110\"><span class=\"h2\">Positive screen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals who screen positive should receive genetic counseling. If both partners carry a <em>CFTR</em> mutation, there is a one in four chance that their child will be affected. The severity of clinical disease in offspring varies as a function of the specific genetic mutations present. For mutations other than the <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F508</span> or W1282X alleles or those associated with CAVD, there is no simple, predictable relationship between genotype and phenotype for CF mutations. (See <a href=\"#H344024802\" class=\"local\">'Prediction of phenotype'</a> below and <a href=\"#H344024290\" class=\"local\">'Genetic consultation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344023117\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative screen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals who screen negative do not carry any of the <em>CFTR</em> mutations in the screening panel: A negative result thus reduces the likelihood <strong>but does not eliminate</strong> the possibility that the individual is a <em>CFTR</em> mutation carrier. When both partners test negative, the risk of having a child with CF is greatly reduced, as shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55196\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55196 \">table 2</a>). Using the currently recommended 23 mutation panel, an Ashkenazi Jewish couple with no history of CF who both test negative has a 1 in 490,000 chance of having an affected offspring, and an Asian American couple who both test negative has a 1 in 134,000 chance of an affected offspring. Even when one member of the couple tests positive and the other tests negative, the risk of disease is lower than would be estimated from the background risk: 1 in 1540 in offspring of Ashkenazi Jews and 1 in 732 in offspring of Asian Americans.</p><p>The degree to which the risk of being a carrier is reduced after a negative test is determined by the number of mutations screened for and the proportion of CF attributable to those mutations. As an example, if a non-Hispanic white woman of Northern European descent does not carry the <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F508</span> mutation (which accounts for 75 percent of all CF cases in this population), her risk of being a CF carrier is reduced from 1 in 25 (the a priori risk based solely on ethnic origin) to 1 in 99.

The possibility of an affected child cannot be completely eliminated as a donor with a negative family history of CF and a negative CF panel could still have an unidentified CF mutation.

Fetal blood can also be tested, but this procedure is performed at &ge;18 weeks of gestation and has a higher risk of procedure-related pregnancy loss.</p><p>As discussed above, if one parent of an affected child is screen-positive and the other is screen-negative, prenatal diagnosis will not be able to distinguish a carrier fetus with an unidentifiable CF mutation from an unaffected fetus. Although this circumstance is unlikely to alter pregnancy management, the child should receive genetic counseling in adulthood. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84945698\"><span class=\"h3\">Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis using cell-free DNA isolated from maternal plasma is not yet commercially available, it is theoretically possible. However, it would require overcoming some challenges since cell-free DNA extracted from maternal blood contains a mixture of DNA fragments from both maternal and placental (fetal) cells; using current technology, maternal cell-free DNA cannot be distinguished from placental (fetal) cell-free DNA. </p><p>If both parents were <em>CFTR</em> mutation carriers and each carried a different mutation, or if the maternal and paternal mutations were the same but were closely linked to polymorphisms that could distinguish the two, then excluding the paternal mutation in the cell-free DNA sample would indicate that the fetus was not affected (would either be a heterozygote carrying the mother's mutation or would be mutation-free). If the paternal mutation was present in the sample, techniques to determine if the fetus also inherited the maternal mutation would have to be employed. This would require documentation that the cell-free DNA sample contained a significant excess of DNA fragments containing the maternal mutation, with the extra allele-containing fragments presumed to come from the fetus. </p><p>If both parents carried the same mutation and they could not be distinguished by nearby polymorphisms, it would be more difficult to establish that the fetus did or did not inherit two mutant alleles. Research publications have reported that this kind of analysis has been achieved for other autosomal recessive disorders, using digital PCR and sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344024802\"><span class=\"h3\">Prediction of phenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If prenatal diagnosis determines that the fetus carries two <em>CFTR</em> mutations, parents should be counseled about the likely CF phenotype so that they can make an informed decision about the future of the pregnancy.</p><p>In the setting of a family history of CF in which at least one of the CF mutations inherited by the fetus is identical to that carried by the affected family member, the fetus can be predicted to have a phenotype similar to that of the affected relative. This is especially true if the fetus has inherited at least one of the two most common CF mutations <span class=\"nowrap\">(&Delta;F508</span> or W1282X), which are associated with the classic CF phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>], or the R117H mutation and the 5T or 7T allele or <span class=\"nowrap\">5T/5T</span> homozygosity, which are associated with congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD) in a male fetus. However, a different mutation from a carrier parent without an affected family member can also have important effects on phenotype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Classic CF'</a>.)</p><p>If the fetus inherits other, less common mutations, or if only limited medical information about the affected relative is available, phenotype prediction is difficult. For individual fetuses who do not inherit the <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F508</span> or W1282X alleles or those associated with CAVD, there is no simple, predictable relationship between genotype and phenotype; such fetuses may have &quot;nonclassic&quot; or &quot;atypical&quot; CF. The terms nonclassic and atypical CF have been used to describe patients who fulfill diagnostic criteria for CF but have a normal or intermediate sweat chloride result. These terms have also been used to describe patients with clinical disease limited to only one organ system: pancreatitis, liver disease, nasal polyps, or bilateral CAVD.</p><p>Because of the wide spectrum of severity in CF, in part due to the inherited mutations and in part resulting from different treatment regimens and environmental factors, accurate prenatal prediction of the postnatal phenotype is not possible for fetuses who do not inherit the <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F508</span> or W1282X alleles or those associated with CAVD. Because 95 percent of the morbidity and mortality of CF is attributable to pulmonary disease, predicting pulmonary function in fetuses homozygous for CF mutations is of prime importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-carrier-screening/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Similarly, prenatal prediction of the age at which CF symptoms will occur, the fetus' risk of eventually developing liver disease or diabetes mellitus, or its adult <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/height</span> ratio is not possible.

Some couples will use their screening results to prevent the birth of an affected infant, while others will use the information to plan for the birth of an affected child. Because obstetric management is not changed by the prenatal diagnosis of CF, couples who would not terminate an affected pregnancy may elect to wait and have newborn CF screening. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Benefits and limitations of screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for CF should be <strong>offered</strong> to the following patients:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals with a family history of CF</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reproductive partners of individuals who have CF</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Couples in whom one or both partners are Caucasian and of European or Ashkenazi Jewish descent and who are planning a pregnancy or seeking prenatal care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The test should be <strong>made available</strong> to women of other ethnic groups, who have been informed of the detectability of CF in individuals of their heritage. Because mixed ethnicity is common, it is reasonable to offer CF carrier screening to all patients (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening may be sequential (the woman is tested first; her partner is tested only if she is a carrier), or couple-based (both partners are tested at the same time). CF testing laboratories will screen for a specific panel of the 23 to 32 most common CF mutations in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65637 \">table 3</a>). The basic panel of 23 mutations accounts for almost 90 percent of detectable mutations in North American non-Hispanic whites. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Screening strategies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H344022458\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of screening results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the CF screen is positive, the individual should receive genetic counseling. If both partners carry a CF mutation, there is a one in four chance that their child will be affected. The severity of clinical disease in offspring varies as a function of the specific genetic mutations present. However, except when the fetus inherits the CF mutations <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F508</span> or W1282X (which are associated with classic CF), or a male fetus inherits the CF mutations associated with congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD), there is no direct relationship between genotype and phenotype, making the phenotype difficult to predict. (See <a href=\"#H344022458\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of screening results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A negative screening test means only that the individual does not carry any of the CF mutations in the screening battery; a negative result thus reduces the likelihood, <strong>but does not eliminate</strong> the possibility, that the individual is a CF carrier. The degree to which the risk of being a carrier is reduced after a negative test is determined by the number of mutations screened for and the proportion of CF attributable to those mutations. (See <a href=\"#H344022458\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of screening results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If both members of a couple are determined to be CF carriers, the next step is to test the fetus. If the fetus inherits the <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;F508</span> or W1282X mutations or those associated with CAVD, phenotype prediction is possible. In the setting of a family history of CF in which at least one of the CF mutations inherited by the fetus is identical to that carried by the affected family member, the fetus may be predicted to have a phenotype similar to that of the affected relative. If the fetus inherits other, less common mutations, or if limited medical information about the affected relative is available, phenotype prediction is difficult.
