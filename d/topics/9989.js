Over time, and likely due to low <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> content, &quot;Lithia&quot; water was ultimately replaced by lithium tablets. With the higher concentrations in the tablets, lithium's association with tremors and weakness became apparent and in 1898 the first descriptions of lithium toxicity appeared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. About a half century later, the calming effects of lithium in 10 patients with mania were described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; the drug's more toxic effects were recognized when lithium chloride was used as a salt substitute in patients with heart failure in 1949 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a>'s toxic effects limited its clinical use until appropriate serum monitoring became more readily available. In the 1970s, Lithium carbonate was approved in the United States for the treatment of acute mania and bipolar disorder and it has been in use ever since. In 2014, there were 6850 cases of lithium intoxication reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the diagnosis and management of acute and chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> poisoning. The therapeutic use of lithium, major side effects of lithium therapy, and other aspects of the management of patients with acute poisoning are discussed separately. A summary table to facilitate emergent management of lithium poisoning is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53656\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53656 \">table 1</a>).

It affects two intracellular signaling pathways, inositol monophosphate and glycogen synthase kinase-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Lithium decreases intracellular inositol, which may be a mechanism for mood stabilization. Lithium also inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3, a component of diverse signaling pathways involved in energy metabolism, neuroprotection, and neuroplasticity.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> has a narrow therapeutic index; a large proportion of patients on chronic lithium therapy experience at least one episode of toxicity during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The highest intracellular lithium levels are found in the brain and the kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal absorption of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> is rapid and complete after oral administration. Peak blood levels are reached in one to two hours following therapeutic ingestion of immediate release products, and four to six hours after therapeutic ingestion of sustained release products. Up to 12 hours or longer may be required before peak levels are reached in acute overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> is a small ion (74 Daltons) with no protein or tissue binding and is therefore amenable to hemodialysis. Lithium is freely distributed throughout total body water with a volume of distribution between 0.6 to 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg,</span> although the volume may be smaller in the elderly, who have less lean body mass and less total body water. Steady state serum levels are typically reached within five days at the usual oral dose of 1200 to 1800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. The half-life for lithium is approximately 18 hours in adults and 36 hours in the elderly.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> is excreted almost entirely by the kidneys and is handled in a manner similar to sodium. Lithium is freely filtered but over 60 percent is then reabsorbed by the proximal tubules.</p><p>Volume depletion or renal impairment from any cause increases <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> reabsorption. Examples of such conditions include gastrointestinal losses, acute decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, and the administration of diuretics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of poisoning and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> poisoning may be acute, as occurs when a patient who is not on lithium therapy ingests a bottle of lithium tablets in a suicide attempt; acute-on-chronic, as occurs when a patient who is on lithium therapy also ingests a large number of lithium tablets all at once; or chronic, as occurs when a patient on a stable lithium regimen suffers a reduction in renal function. The symptoms and signs of toxicity differ based upon the total body burden of lithium and the rate of onset of toxicity.</p><p>Elderly patients are especially at risk for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> toxicity due to both a lower glomerular filtration rate and a reduced volume of distribution (secondary to reductions in lean body mass and total body water). Lithium toxicity can also occur with minor declines in renal function, as a result of nephrotoxic drug interactions, or from dehydration for any reason.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute and acute-on-chronic poisoning</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With any acute ingestion, it is important to determine the formulation of the drug (eg, standard formulation or sustained release), the amount or dose ingested, the timing (eg, acute or chronic), and the intent (eg, intentional or not). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> can be prescribed as lithium carbonate or more commonly as a sustained release formulation (eg, Lithobid and Eskalith).</p><p>With <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> poisoning, it is important to ask about dehydration, medications, and coingestants. Any condition causing dehydration, such as vomiting or diarrhea, fever or heat-related illness, anorexia or infection, may contribute to lithium toxicity.</p><p>Medications that cause dehydration or renal impairment can also precipitate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> toxicity. Examples include diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Therefore, it is important to inquire about any new medications or changes in the dose of long-standing medications.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> poisoning often occurs in vulnerable populations, such as patients with mental illness and poor living conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical findings</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> &ndash; Patients with acute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> toxicity often develop and present with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. If vomiting and diarrhea are severe, dehydration and compromised renal function can develop, impairing the ability to excrete lithium and exacerbating lithium toxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac</strong> &ndash; Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> toxicity can cause changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG), dangerous arrhythmias or other important clinical effects are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Prolonged QTc intervals and bradycardia have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Lithium poisoning is not associated with elevations in cardiac biomarkers or left ventricular dysfunction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic</strong> &ndash; Neurologic findings develop late in acute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> poisoning because time is required for the drug to be absorbed and to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS). Potential neurologic symptoms and signs include sluggishness, ataxia, confusion or agitation, and neuromuscular excitability, which can manifest as irregular coarse tremors, fasciculations, or myoclonic jerks. Severe lithium intoxication can lead to seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and encephalopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-term neurologic sequelae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, neurologic complications persist despite <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> removal by hemodialysis. The syndrome of irreversible lithium effectuated neurotoxicity (SILENT) consists of prolonged neurologic and neuropsychiatric symptoms following lithium toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In typical cases of SILENT, neurologic toxicity develops along with an elevated lithium concentration, but symptoms persist despite successful removal of the drug.</p><p>Cerebellar dysfunction, extrapyramidal symptoms, brainstem dysfunction, and dementia can develop as part of SILENT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Other neurologic sequelae may include nystagmus, choreoathetoid movements, myopathy, and blindness. A review of 90 published cases identified cerebellar dysfunction as the most common sequelae, and proposed that demyelination at multiple sites in the CNS may be the cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. SILENT can continue for months and in rare cases effects persist for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic toxicity</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">History and common presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> toxicity presents in a different manner than either acute or acute-on-chronic toxicity.</p><p>Long term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> use may result in a concentrating deficit in the kidneys, such that a dilute urine is excreted. Normally, the resulting thirst and increased intake of free water compensate for these fluid losses. Thus, many patients on chronic lithium therapy have polyuria and polydipsia. However, when other toxic effects (eg, confusion), physical disability, or intercurrent illness prevent these patients from drinking free water, dehydration results and lithium toxicity ensues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> toxicity can also develop solely from the effects of volume depletion, especially in warmer climates, or when concurrent medications, such as NSAIDs or ACE inhibitors, cause a decrease in renal excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In such cases, the clinical manifestations of toxicity (eg, agitation, confusion, slurred speech) are often superimposed on complications from chronic use (eg, neuromuscular irritability, tremor).</p><p>As with acute poisoning, it is important to inquire about the dose and formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> and the duration of therapy, as well as any recent illness associated with fluid loss (eg, vomiting, diarrhea, fever).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical findings</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic</strong> &ndash; In contradistinction to patients with acute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> poisoning, in whom neurologic signs develop late, patients on chronic lithium therapy develop toxicity gradually and often present with neurologic findings.<br/><br/>Potential neurologic symptoms and signs are identical to those seen with acute or acute-on-chronic poisoning and can include sluggishness, ataxia, confusion or agitation, and neuromuscular excitability, which can manifest as irregular coarse tremors, fasciculations, or myoclonic jerks. Severe toxicity can result in seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and encephalopathy.<br/><br/>According to a retrospective review involving 28 patients with lithium poisoning complicated by severe neurotoxicity, risk factors for developing neurotoxicity include age over 50 years, chronic lithium therapy (rather than acute overdose), development of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, hyperthyroidism, and impaired renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Early levels can be helpful to confirm ongoing toxicity but may not represent peak serum concentrations in a patient who has ingested sustained release tablets. Thus, lithium concentrations are repeated every two to four hours initially to determine the adequacy of therapy (IV hydration or hemodialysis) and to confirm a trend of improvement. Once they approach the therapeutic range or are consistently trending downward in a patient who is improving clinically, serum lithium concentrations may be obtained less frequently (ie, every 6 to 12 hours) until symptoms resolve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H311708210\"><span class=\"h3\">Correlation with clinical toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> concentrations often do not correlate with clinical signs of toxicity.

In addition, reports exist of severe clinical toxicity despite therapeutic lithium concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lithium-poisoning/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].

The presentation generally involves a patient on chronic lithium therapy who, due to toxic drug effects (eg, confusion), physical disability, or concurrent illness, does not drink enough free water, leading to gradual dehydration and reduced renal excretion of lithium. Alternatively, toxicity can develop solely from the effects of volume depletion, such as insensate losses in warmer climates, or from the renal effects of concurrent medications such as NSAIDs or ACE inhibitors. The initial symptoms and signs of chronic toxicity are often neurologic and encompass the same range of potential findings as in acute poisoning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for a patient with presumptive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> poisoning includes serotonin syndrome (SS) and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), particularly if the patient has a history of mental illness and is taking psychiatric medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both syndromes cause altered mentation and profound neuromuscular findings. Although an elevated temperature may be seen in either SS or NMS, fever can also precipitate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> toxicity in a patient on chronic therapy. NMS is characterized by &quot;lead pipe&quot; rigidity. Patients with either SS or lithium toxicity may manifest clonus, but in SS this is most prominent in the lower extremities. Ultimately, a serum lithium concentration helps to confirm the diagnosis of lithium poisoning. (See <a href=\"#H311708151\" class=\"local\">'Serum lithium concentration'</a> above.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> toxicity may be confused with acute ethanol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.
