Since then five additional tetracyclines have been isolated or derived (oxytetracycline, tetracycline, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=demeclocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">demeclocycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>), but only the last four are available for systemic use in the United States. Of these four agents, doxycycline and minocycline are the most frequently prescribed. Research to find tetracycline analogues lead to the development of the glycylcyclines. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tigecycline</a> is the first of this new class of agents and exhibits broad-spectrum antibacterial activity similar to the tetracyclines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> is one of the most active tetracyclines and is the most often used clinically since it possesses many advantages over traditional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>. Doxycycline can be administered twice daily, has both intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) formulations, achieves reasonable concentrations even if administered with food, and is less likely to cause photosensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Doxycycline may be an alternative for use in children since it binds calcium to a lesser extent than tetracycline, which can cause tooth discoloration and bony growth retardation. The increase in frequency of multidrug-resistant organisms has led to the resurgence of IV minocycline for the treatment of infections caused by these organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tetracyclines enter the bacterial cell wall in two ways: passive diffusion and an energy-dependent active transport system, which is probably mediated in a pH-dependent fashion. Once inside the cell, tetracyclines bind reversibly to the 30S ribosomal subunit at a position that blocks the binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site on the mRNA-ribosome complex. Protein synthesis is ultimately inhibited, leading to a bacteriostatic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to many other antibiotics, tetracyclines are infrequently inactivated biologically or altered chemically by resistant bacteria. Resistance to these agents develops primarily by preventing accumulation of the drug inside the cell either by decreasing influx or increasing efflux. Once resistance develops to one of the drugs in this class, it is typically conferred to all tetracyclines.</p><p>However, there are differences in resistance among species of bacteria. Resistance genes to tetracyclines often occur on plasmids or other transferable elements such as transposons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Bacteria carrying a ribosome protection type of resistance gene produce a cytoplasmic protein that interacts with the ribosomes and allows the ribosomes to proceed with protein synthesis even in the presence of high intracellular levels of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tigecycline</a> has a reduced potential for resistance, as it is not affected by the two major mechanisms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> resistance: ribosomal protection proteins and efflux pumps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, tigecycline may have activity against tetracycline-resistant organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antimicrobial activity of all the tetracyclines is essentially the same although some differences in the relative degree of activity against certain pathogens do exist among the various agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58190 \">table 1</a>). As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> appears to be the most active of the compounds due to its slight increase in lipid solubility. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> follows closely behind.</p><p>The tetracyclines are considered broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotics that are used to treat infection caused by many aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. However, they also have activity against many atypical pathogens, including Rickettsia spp., Borrelia spp., Coxiella burnetii, Treponema spp., Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Plasmodium spp., Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Brucella spp., Calymmatobacterium granulomatis, Leptospira, Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia recurrentis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Mycobacterium marinum, and Entamoeba histolytica. These drugs have little activity against fungi and viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Against N. gonorrhoeae, the 2006 Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) report shows that 25.6 percent of isolates collected in 2006 were resistant to penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, or some combination of those antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Therefore, use of tetracyclines for the treatment of N. gonorrhoeae in the US is NOT recommended by the CDC.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> is effective for patients with nongonococcal urethritis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis; however, recurrent urethritis in patients previously treated with doxycycline may be the result of tetracycline-resistant U. urealyticum. Doxycycline is an alternative agent in the treatment of genital Chlamydial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tigecycline</a> has a broader spectrum of activity when compared to the tetracyclines. Tigecycline has activity against gram-positive pathogens including: Enterococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Listeria, Streptococcus spp., both methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus, and S. epidermidis. Its gram-negative activity includes: Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pasteurella multocida, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACODYNAMICS/PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In animal studies, the <span class=\"nowrap\">pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic</span> parameter that most closely correlates with the efficacy of tetracyclines is the 24 hour ratio of the area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). After exposure of Staphylococcus aureus to the tetracyclines at five times the MIC for two hours, a post-antibiotic effect lasting for three hours has been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination of tetracyclines and penicillins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A deleterious effect was observed for the combination of a static and cidal antibiotic when chlortetracycline and penicillin were used together for the treatment of pneumococcal meningitis. The combination of the two drugs was inferior to penicillin alone. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tetracycline</a> administered with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> may result in diminished bactericidal activity of the penicillin. Thus, combinations of tetracyclines and penicillins should be avoided, if possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Absorption of the tetracyclines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absorption of tetracyclines occurs primarily in the proximal small intestine and the stomach. The bioavailability of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> approaches 95 percent (with or without food), with peak serum concentrations seen one to three hours after the dose. By contrast, the bioavailability of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> is reduced by 50 percent if it is taken with food. The absorption of all tetracyclines can be decreased with the concomitant administration of multivalent cations (ie, aluminum, calcium, iron, magnesium). These cations chelate with the tetracyclines impairing their absorption. Concurrent administration of products containing divalent or trivalent cations should be avoided with all tetracyclines with the possible exception of doxycycline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum concentrations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maximum serum concentration after an intravenous dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> occurs within 30 minutes; after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tigecycline</a>, within one hour. Peak concentrations of doxycycline range from 1.5 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> after a dose of 200 mg orally and 4 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for the same dose administered intravenously.

Doxycycline also distributes into the bone, fat, and muscle at concentrations below plasma levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tetracycline</a> distributes well into ascitic fluid, bile, CNS (10 to 26 percent), sinuses, pleural and synovial fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Minocycline</a> has been found in therapeutic concentrations in the aqueous humor, bile, duodenum, fallopian <span class=\"nowrap\">tubes/ovaries,</span> liver, lung, sinuses, saliva, sputum, tears, and thyroid gland.

Animal data demonstrate that tigecycline distributes well into bone, bone marrow, spleen, and thyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>].</p><p>In addition, all the tetracyclines cross the placenta and accumulate in the bone and teeth of the fetus. The tetracyclines are also excreted in breast milk, although complexation with calcium in breast milk limits availability to the breast-fed infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Routes of elimination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The routes of elimination differ among the tetracyclines. The primary route of elimination for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> is the kidney via glomerular filtration. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> is primarily eliminated in the intestinal tract, with up to 90 percent of the dose excreted in the feces. Approximately 20 percent of a doxycycline dose is eliminated by glomerular filtration. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tigecycline</a> is eliminated through the feces as unchanged drug.</p><p>Dose adjustment is not necessary for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tigecycline</a> in patients with renal dysfunction, and thus, these are the preferred tetracyclines in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Dose adjustment is only required in severe hepatic dysfunction for doxycycline and tigecycline (maintenance dose 25 mg IV every 12 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Minocycline</a> is metabolized in the liver to at least six inactive metabolites. Only 4 to 9 percent of minocycline is excreted via the kidneys, and fecal concentrations are also minimal. No accumulation of minocycline is seen with hepatic failure. Similar to doxycycline, food has little effect on the absorption of minocycline. The tetracyclines are minimally removed by hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or hemofiltration; therefore, dose adjustments are not necessary in these situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL POPULATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnant or breastfeeding women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetracyclines can cause fetal toxicity when given to pregnant women. For certain infections, the potential risks may be offset by the benefits. However, tetracyclines should generally <strong>not</strong> be used in pregnant women or children under the age of eight years unless other appropriate drugs are ineffective or contraindicated.</p><p>Tetracyclines cross the placenta and achieve concentrations in umbilical-cord plasma and amniotic fluid of 60 and 20 percent, respectively, of levels in the maternal circulation. This can cause accumulation in fetal bone and teeth. Tetracyclines are found in high concentrations in human breast milk, but concentrations are very low in breast-fed infants, which is probably a reflection of chelation by calcium in breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These agents, with the possible exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tigecycline</a>, should generally not be used in patients with end-stage renal disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80309\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80309 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetracyclines are generally safe drugs, but some adverse effects can occur.</p><p>The following provides a brief summary of some of the major adverse effects associated with tetracyclines.

These include abdominal discomfort, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Food may decrease these symptoms but also may decrease the absorption of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> by 50 percent. Food does not affect the absorption of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>.</p><p>Tetracyclines may alter gut flora to cause large bulky stools and diarrhea. Diarrhea usually subsides once the agent is stopped. A patient with continued diarrhea, fever, and a rising white blood count should be evaluated for antibiotic associated diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile. Esophageal ulcerations and strictures have been reported with tetracyclines but can be prevented by taking the drugs with plenty of water and not before bedtime.

If a patient is allergic to one <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, they should be considered allergic to all. Photosensitivity reactions can occur, ranging from a red rash to blistering on areas exposed to the sun. These reactions are most common with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=demeclocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">demeclocycline</a> but can occur with all analogues. Photosensitivity can be decreased by avoiding direct sunlight or wearing protective clothing with sunscreen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Teeth and bone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetracyclines can cause a brown to yellow discoloration of the teeth in children under the age of eight that is sometimes associated with hypoplasia of the enamel.

A 2013 analysis of 10 clinical trials showed an increased risk of death in patients receiving tigecycline for FDA-approved uses, including community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin structure infections, and complicated intraabdominal infections (2.5 versus 1.8 percent, adjusted risk difference 0.6 percent) [2]. The FDA has subsequently added a boxed warning stating that tigecycline should be reserved for use in situations when alternative agents are not suitable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Other, less common reactions, include minocycline-induced lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>] and pericardial effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Nausea and vomiting have been reported with increased frequency with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tigecycline</a> (30 and 20 percent) compared to tetracyclines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG INTERACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absorption of tetracyclines can be impaired by co-administered minerals and antacids (eg, calcium, magnesium, iron), lanthanum, and dairy including milk. Tetracyclines can interact with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a>, beta-lactams, and a variety of other drugs. Specific drug interactions of the tetracyclines and management suggestions may be determined by using Lexi-Interact, the drug interactions program included with UpToDate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9761634\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tetracyclines inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding reversibly to the 30S ribosomal subunit. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased accumulation of drug within bacteria leads to resistance; drug uptake is affected by decreasing influx or increasing efflux. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Resistance'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tetracyclines are considered broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotics with activity against many aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and atypical pathogens, such as mycoplasma and chlamydia. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Spectrum of activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absorption of tetracyclines occurs primarily in the proximal small intestine and the stomach with good distribution into tissues and body fluids. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tetracyclines should generally not be used in pregnant women or children under the age of eight years unless other appropriate drugs are ineffective or contraindicated. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tetracyclines are generally safe; the most common adverse events are related to gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, epigastric discomfort and nausea). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Adverse reactions'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetracyclines/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Stein GE, Craig WA.
