In the setting of malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction, stents may be used as a bridge to surgery or, in patients with unresectable disease, for palliation.</p><p>This topic will review the use of stents in the management of malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction. The use of stents for the treatment of benign disease or for the prevention of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography induced pancreatitis is discussed elsewhere.

By providing biliary decompression, stenting can minimize the risk of developing cholangitis while relieving jaundice and pruritus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7922063\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative biliary drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distal placement of a plastic stent or a short self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) does not interfere with the ability to perform subsequent pancreaticoduodenectomy. However, the benefit of preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage with regard to postoperative outcomes in patients with resectable pancreaticobiliary disease is debated. Proceeding directly to surgery may limit the number of interventions and thus decrease costs and potential procedure-related complications. On the other hand, performing preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage may relieve jaundice and prevent complications due to cholestasis. In addition, preoperative stenting may allow time for neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma#H102910645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of localized cholangiocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Preoperative biliary decompression'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial chemotherapy and radiation for nonmetastatic, locally advanced, unresectable and borderline resectable, exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Preoperative metal stents appeared to be safe and effective in a multicenter retrospective study of 241 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent preoperative metal stent placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The patients were followed for a mean duration of 6.3 months, with 49 percent of patients being alive at 27 months. Successful stent placement was achieved in all patients with improved jaundice. Immediate complications included post-ERCP pancreatitis (n = 14), stent migration (n = 3), and duodenal perforation (n = 3). Long-term complications included stent migration (n = 9) and hepatic abscess (n = 1). Fourteen patients (5.8 percent) experienced stent occlusion, with a time to stent occlusion of 6.6 months (range 1 to 20 months). A total of 144 of 174 patients (83 percent) deemed to have resectable cancer at the time of diagnosis subsequently underwent curative surgery. Due to disease progression or the discovery of metastasis after neoadjuvant therapy, only 22 of 67 patients (33 percent) with borderline-resectable cancer underwent curative surgery. </p><p>However, a meta-analysis of 14 studies with 2248 patients found that preoperative stenting did not improve outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There was no difference between those who underwent preoperative stenting and those who did not with regard to mortality, infections, development of pancreatic fistulas, bile leaks, or delayed gastric emptying. The authors of this study ultimately felt that preoperative biliary drainage should be used in selected patients and reported a preference for metal biliary stents over plastic stents, although both are within the standard of care. Our general approach is to place a metal biliary stent once the diagnosis of malignancy has been confirmed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7922070\"><span class=\"h2\">Palliation of unresectable cancer</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7922460\"><span class=\"h3\">Obstruction of the distal bile duct</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distal malignant biliary obstruction (ie, obstruction distal to the hilum) is often due to pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, or external compression from lymph node metastases. Possible palliative treatments for unresectable malignant biliary obstruction include surgical bypass, percutaneous drainage, and endoscopic drainage with either plastic or metal biliary stents. A large meta-analysis reviewing 2436 patients comparing surgical bypass, endoscopic metal stents, and endoscopic plastic stents concluded that endoscopic metal stents are the treatment of choice in patients with unresectable distal malignant biliary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Endoscopic biliary drainage is the preferred treatment for palliative drainage in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, because it is technically difficult, endoscopic drainage of hilar obstructions should, in general, be performed by endoscopists with significant case volume and expertise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25802026\"><span class=\"h2\">Unknown resectability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient's surgical plan may not be known during the initial endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (eg, if neoadjuvant chemotherapy is being considered or if biliary drainage is required before staging can be completed). Options in this setting include placing a plastic (and thus easily removed) stent or a SEMS (which provides longer-term patency, but in most cases cannot be removed). A Monte Carlo decision analysis compared several strategies in patients with obstructive jaundice from pancreatic cancer with an undetermined surgical plan, and the results suggested that a short-length SEMS is the preferred initial treatment for overall cost minimization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In general, the placement of metal stents should be considered in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer, especially if surgery is likely to be delayed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1135516949\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF STENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7922269\"><span class=\"h2\">Plastic stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plastic biliary stents have been used in benign and malignant biliary obstruction since their development during the 1980s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50266\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50266 \">picture 1</a>). Plastic stents can be made from multiple materials including Teflon, polyurethane, and polyethylene. Stent shapes include straight (Amsterdam), single-pigtail, and double-pigtail. Straight stents have one, two, or four flaps at each end to help anchor the stent. Available stent diameters include 7, 8.5, 10, and 11.5 Fr with lengths ranging between 5 and 15 cm. If longer stent lengths are needed, nasobiliary drains can be cut to a desired length, although they are prone to migration given the lack of flaps.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1135516956\"><span class=\"h2\">Metal stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) have been used to treat malignant biliary strictures since the 1980s. Once the purview of tertiary referral centers only, the use of biliary SEMS has disseminated into widespread clinical practice. SEMS can be uncovered, partially covered, or fully covered. Some fully covered metal stents have &quot;fenestrations&quot; in their covering without any exposed bare metal struts. The metal component can be stainless steel, nitinol (a combination of nickel and titanium), or Platinol. Platinol consists of a platinum core with nitinol encasement. Nitinol has traditionally been the preferred metal due to its ability to maintain the shape of a curved lumen, but no one material is superior in all situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Covered stents can be lined with silicone, polycaprolactone, polyether polyurethane, polyurethane, or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene fluorinated ethylene propylene (PFTE). All are effective.</p><p>Metal biliary stents are cylindrical in shape and made by interwoven alloy wires, with some stents having proximal and distal flaring to reduce migration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50214\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50214 \">picture 2</a>). Biliary SEMS are deployed with through-the-scope (TTS) delivery systems that have diameters ranging from 6 to 8.5 Fr. SEMS come pre-constrained within delivery catheters. Essentially, all currently available stents are deployed via the removal or withdrawal of an outer restraining sheath, although specific delivery catheter types and mechanisms vary widely. Some SEMS shorten upon deployment, which should be taken into consideration during selection of a stent length, during stent placement, and during stent deployment. After deployment, the stent material embeds into both the tumor and normal tissue by expansile, radial pressure. This process is necessary to keep the stent from migrating.</p><p>Argon plasma coagulation can be used to trim SEMS that are malpositioned or that have migrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7923076\"><span class=\"h3\">Available stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple stents are available in the United States and include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71470\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71470 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>WallFlex stents (Boston Scientific) &ndash; Uncovered, partially covered, or fully covered Platinol stents.

A large prospective study involving 241 patients with unresectable malignant biliary strictures randomized patients to a 6 mm Zilver stent, a 10 mm Zilver stent, or a 10 mm uncovered Wallstent to evaluate differences in occlusion rates between different diameter uncovered metal stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In addition, multiple studies have demonstrated low rates of stent migration with uncovered metal stents in malignant biliary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. A prospective study involving 241 patients who received different types of uncovered metal stents for the treatment of unresectable malignant biliary strictures had only three cases of stent migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Another study of 101 patients who received an uncovered metal stent for malignant biliary obstruction did not have any cases of stent migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The disadvantages of uncovered metal stents include, at best, limited removability and higher rates of tumor ingrowth. Although tumor ingrowth is a significant problem and the most common cause of failure in uncovered stents, it is not a problem that is unique to this stent type, as tumor ingrowth can also occur in covered stents if the covering degrades or becomes compromised. (See <a href=\"#H1135517074\" class=\"local\">'Tissue ingrowth'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1135516991\"><span class=\"h3\">Covered metal stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary advantages of covered stents are the potential reduction of tumor ingrowth and their potential for removability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77951\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77951 \">picture 4</a>). Rates of tumor ingrowth with covered metal stents have been examined in several trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study evaluated the patency of partially covered Wallstents in 48 patients as the primary treatment and in 56 patients as a reintervention for palliation of unresectable biliary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Stent occlusion occurred in a total of 19 patients. Etiologies included tumor overgrowth (ie, tumor blocking the ends of the stent), biliary sludge, and food impaction. Tumor ingrowth was not a cause of occlusion in any patient in this study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study with 80 consecutive patients who were treated with a partially covered Wallstent for distal malignant biliary obstruction had no stent failures thought to be secondary to tumor ingrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study examined 101 consecutive patients with partially covered Wallstents for the treatment of malignant biliary strictures. Stent patency rates were 97 percent at three months, 85 percent at six months, and 68 percent at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There were only three cases of stent occlusion, with no known stent failures secondary to tumor ingrowth.</p><p/><p>However, studies directly comparing covered with uncovered stents have failed to show a benefit for covered stents with regard to stent patency. (See <a href=\"#H7922550\" class=\"local\">'Covered versus uncovered metal stents'</a> below.)</p><p>Fully covered stents have the advantage of potential removability, but it must be noted that these devices do not have FDA approval for delayed removal. The fully covered WallFlex stent is approved for immediate removal in cases of misdeployment.</p><p>The disadvantages of using covered metal stents include potentially increased rates of stent migration, an inability to use the stents at the level of the hilum, and the possibility of stent-induced cholecystitis. Increased rates of stent migration are presumably secondary to the limited ability of the stents to embed into the tumor and surrounding tissue because of the overlying covering. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is commonly performed prior to placement of SEMS, in theory to help facilitate insertion and possibly minimize the risk of pancreatitis. However, performing biliary sphincterotomy prior to SEMS may lead to increased rates of stent migration and other complications. (See <a href=\"#H1135517088\" class=\"local\">'Migration'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1135517096\" class=\"local\">'Cholecystitis'</a> below.)</p><p>It should be recognized that not all fully covered stents are the same. Some stents that are fully covered have fenestrations (ie, all of their metal struts are covered by a coating), but the fenestrations allow drainage of bile through the side holes and into the main lumen of the stent. These fenestrations may allow more flexible positioning of the stent (ie, across the presumed location of the cystic duct orifice) in patients with a gallbladder in situ and may reduce the risk of cholecystitis<em>.</em> </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17012685\"><span class=\"h2\">New developments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug-eluting stents that incorporate antitumor agents are being developed and evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].

Proceeding directly to surgery may limit the number of interventions and thus decrease costs and potential procedure-related complications. On the other hand, performing preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage may relieve jaundice and prevent complications due to cholestasis. In addition, preoperative stenting is typically used to allow time for neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer without the need for interval stent exchange. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial chemotherapy and radiation for nonmetastatic, locally advanced, unresectable and borderline resectable, exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma#H102910645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of localized cholangiocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Preoperative biliary decompression'</a>.)</p><p>Studies of preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage have shown the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the effect of preoperative biliary drainage on postoperative outcomes in 90 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The majority of the patients had pancreatic cancer and 62 percent underwent preoperative biliary drainage, whereas 38 percent proceeded directly to surgery. Repeat surgery was required significantly more often in the group that went directly to surgery (4 versus 15 percent, p = 0.02). However, 30 and 90 day mortality rates were not significantly different. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter randomized trial assigned 202 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer to four to six weeks of preoperative biliary drainage followed by surgery or to surgery alone within one week of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. While there were significantly more serious complications in the preoperative drainage group compared with the surgery alone group (74 versus 39 percent), mortality rates were not significantly different. However, it should be noted that the 25 percent initial endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) failure rate in patients assigned to preoperative biliary drainage was much higher than what has been seen in other studies and in routine clinical practice. In addition, plastic stents were utilized instead of SEMS in all patients. Both of these factors could have contributed to the worse outcomes seen in the preoperative drainage group. In addition, no patients received neoadjuvant therapy. (See <a href=\"#H17011425\" class=\"local\">'Plastic versus metal stents'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SEMS placement in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer was examined in a series of 55 patients with biliary obstruction due to resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The median time for the administration of neoadjuvant therapy and restaging was 104 days (range 70 to 260 days). Stent placement relieved the biliary obstruction in all patients. The presence of the short biliary stent did not interfere with surgery in the 27 patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy. By 260 days, stent occlusion had occurred in seven patients (13 percent) and stent migration in one patient (2 percent).</p><p/><p>The benefit in patients with hilar carcinoma is less clear. A meta-analysis of 11 studies addressed the benefit of preoperative biliary drainage in jaundiced patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma (10 retrospective, only one prospective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There was no difference in death rate or length of postoperative stay with and without preoperative biliary decompression. However, overall postoperative and infectious complication rates were significantly adversely affected by preoperative biliary drainage compared with surgery without preoperative biliary drainage. Based on their results, the authors concluded that preoperative biliary decompression in jaundiced patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma planned for surgery should not be routinely performed. Randomized trials with large sample size and optimal biliary drainage techniques are needed, although these have traditionally been difficult to perform given the small number of patients with cholangiocarcinoma who ultimately undergo surgery, as most present at an advanced state of disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7922765\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plastic biliary stents are commonly used as the initial endoscopic treatment for patients with malignant biliary obstruction. The placement of a plastic stent is inexpensive and effective, and the stent can be easily removed or exchanged. Plastic stents, however, eventually develop occlusion by sludge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bacterial biofilm, and maintaining biliary drainage with plastic stents usually requires repeated ERCPs. Metal stents were introduced to help alleviate this problem by extending the duration of stent patency. However, metal stents have significantly higher costs and may not be removable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17011418\"><span class=\"h3\">Patency of plastic stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of function of plastic biliary stents remains highly variable, with stent patency typically ranging between 60 and 200 days.

As mentioned above, fully covered stents with fenestrations are an option in patients with a gallbladder who warrant metal stent placement, although no conclusive data exist to argue that standard fully covered stents cannot be placed in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H1135516991\" class=\"local\">'Covered metal stents'</a> above.).</p><p>In a study of 457 patients with a malignant bile duct stricture and a gallbladder, patients who underwent covered stent placement had a higher rate of cholecystitis compared with patients who underwent uncovered stent placement (8 versus 1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In a study of 58 patients who underwent placement of a nonfenestrated, fully covered stent for malignant biliary obstruction, two patients (3 percent) developed cholecystitis, although it was unclear if the cholecystitis was caused by the stent itself or the underlying tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Given that the rate of cholecystitis may be as high as 10 percent, caution should be used when placing covered metal stents in patients with an intact gallbladder to avoid placing the stent across the cystic duct orifice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5506608\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholangitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholangitis is a complication of biliary stenting, especially in cases of incomplete drainage. This topic is discussed elsewhere.

Patients will present with evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and should undergo upper endoscopy. Some patients will have hemobilia and may require endoscopic examination with a side-viewing duodenoscope in order for the diagnosis to be made. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic studies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults#H78373603\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;, section on 'Hemobilia'</a>.)</p><p>A retrospective trial comparing metal and plastic stent placement for malignant biliary obstruction found bleeding in 3.6 percent of patients in the metal stent group and 5.4 percent of patients in the plastic stent group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Of note, although the sources of the bleeding events were not described, all patients in the trial received a biliary sphincterotomy prior to stent placement, suggesting that the bleeding may not have been directly related to the stents themselves.</p><p>Perforation and fistula formation are other rare complications of biliary stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. Although there have been concerns about possible increased rates of pancreatitis after the placement of a covered metal biliary stent, a retrospective analysis that included 248 patients treated with SEMS found similar rates of pancreatitis between covered and uncovered metal stents (7 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1135517126\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary stents are commonly used in patients with primary pancreaticobiliary malignancy, metastatic disease, and external biliary compression by lymph nodes. By providing biliary decompression they can relieve jaundice and pruritus, while minimizing the risk of developing cholangitis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary stenting has broad uses in the setting of malignant pancreaticobiliary disease. It is used both as a bridge to surgery in patients with resectable disease and for palliation in patients with biliary obstruction in the setting of unresectable disease. (See <a href=\"#H7922055\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma#H102910645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of localized cholangiocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Preoperative biliary decompression'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of plastic and metal stents, both covered and uncovered, are commercially available. No specific stent has been identified as ideal for all patients. (See <a href=\"#H1135516949\" class=\"local\">'Types of stents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The placement of a plastic stent is inexpensive and effective, and the stent can be easily removed or exchanged. Plastic stents, however, eventually develop occlusion by sludge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bacterial biofilm, and maintaining biliary drainage with plastic stents usually requires repeated endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies. (See <a href=\"#H17011418\" class=\"local\">'Patency of plastic stents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metal stents extend the duration of stent patency. However, metal stents have significantly higher costs and may not be removable. (See <a href=\"#H17011425\" class=\"local\">'Plastic versus metal stents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common complications of biliary stent placement include stent occlusion (secondary to <span class=\"nowrap\">tissue/tumor</span> ingrowth, <span class=\"nowrap\">tissue/tumor</span> overgrowth, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occlusion by sludge) and stent migration. Less common complications of biliary stent placement include cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, perforation, and bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H1135517058\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an intact gallbladder who have a confirmed resectable distal malignant biliary obstruction and require biliary drainage prior to surgery, we will often place an uncovered self-expanding metal stent (SEMS). Placement of a covered stent may block the cystic duct and lead to cholecystitis. However, cholecystitis can also be seen with uncovered stents, so placement of a covered stent in patients with an intact gallbladder is a reasonable alternative and cannot be considered a violation of the standard of care. The choice of stent will depend on the location, geometry, and etiology of the stenosis. Similarly, these factors will determine which stent is chosen for patients who have undergone cholecystectomy. (See <a href=\"#H7922063\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative biliary drainage'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17012786\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative drainage'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7922550\" class=\"local\">'Covered versus uncovered metal stents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with unresectable distal malignant biliary obstruction who have a life expectancy of greater than three months, we suggest placement of a SEMS. If the stent becomes occluded due to <span class=\"nowrap\">tissue/tumor</span> ingrowth, we suggest placing plastic or additional metal stents within the original metal stent to provide drainage. (See <a href=\"#H7922765\" class=\"local\">'Distal obstruction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1135517074\" class=\"local\">'Tissue ingrowth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with unresectable distal malignant biliary obstruction who have a life expectancy of less than three months, we suggest placement of a plastic stent. (See <a href=\"#H17011425\" class=\"local\">'Plastic versus metal stents'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with hilar obstructions, we suggest stenting of both the right and left systems with either plastic stents or uncovered SEMS to decrease the risk of cholangitis. (See <a href=\"#H7922596\" class=\"local\">'Hilar obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Siddiqui AA, Mehendiratta V, Loren D, et al.
