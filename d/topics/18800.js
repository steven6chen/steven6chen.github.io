For some sleep studies, you stay overnight in a sleep lab at a hospital or sleep center.</p><p>In other cases, your doctor can give you a portable sleep monitor to use at home, so you don't have to spend the night in the sleep lab. But you should use a portable monitor only if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your doctor thinks you have a condition that makes you stop breathing for short periods while you are asleep, called &quot;sleep apnea.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You do not have other serious medical problems, such as heart disease or lung disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88711513\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during a sleep study?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before you go to sleep, a technician attaches small, sticky patches called &quot;electrodes&quot; to your head, chest, and legs. He or she will also place a small tube beneath your nose and might wrap 1 or 2 belts around your chest.</p><p>Each of these items has wires that connect to monitors. The monitors record your movement, brain activity, breathing, and other body functions while you sleep.</p><p>If you have a history of trouble falling asleep, your doctor might prescribe a medicine to help you fall asleep in the lab. If you have never taken the medicine before, your doctor might ask you take it on a night before your sleep study to see how it affects you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88711530\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor order a sleep study?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will order a sleep study if he or she thinks you have sleep apnea or a different condition. Examples of other sleep-related conditions include those that make you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an uncomfortable feeling in your legs when you try to fall asleep, or sudden jerking leg movements while you sleep</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel very sleepy during the day and fall asleep all of a sudden</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do odd things while you sleep, such as moving your arms and legs, shouting, or walking</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88711547\"><span class=\"h1\">How should I prepare for a sleep study?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On the day of your sleep study, you should: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid alcohol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid drinking coffee, tea, sodas, and other drinks that have caffeine in the afternoon and evening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take all of your regular medicines, unless your doctor tells you not to</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88711562\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insomnia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insomnia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-apnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sleep apnea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=narcolepsy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Narcolepsy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=restless-legs-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Restless legs syndrome (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insomnia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Insomnia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insomnia-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Insomnia treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-apnea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sleep apnea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
