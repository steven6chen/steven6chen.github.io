Food-allergic reactions are the leading cause of emergency department visits for anaphylaxis in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The only therapy for food allergy is emergency treatment in the case of an accidental exposure that triggers a reaction. The mainstay of management of food allergy is avoidance of the food(s) that causes the allergic reaction. Patients and families must be vigilant about food allergen avoidance in a variety of settings (eg, home, restaurants, schools, camps, social gatherings). The burden of avoidance and fear of an accidental exposure can increase anxiety and result in reduced health-related quality of life (HRQL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

A broader overview of HRQL assessment is discussed separately.

HRQL refers to a person's or group's perception of the effect of an illness and its therapy on their QOL and daily functioning. HRQL has three components: social, psychological, and physical. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with a serious life-threatening illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two types of instruments exist to measure HRQL: generic and disease specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Both questionnaires aim to measure impairments that patients or their families, rather than health professionals, consider important. Patients can have similar levels of clinical impairment and yet have widely different measures of HRQL.</p><p>Generic questionnaires are useful in comparing different diseases, and results may be compared with group norms. In addition, these questionnaires are sensitive to comorbidities. Generic instruments may miss small changes in a patient's impairment over time because they do not incorporate questions directly related to the specific disorder.</p><p>In contrast, disease-specific instruments cannot be used to compare disease states or evaluate comorbidities. However, disease-specific instruments are more sensitive to changes in the illness of interest. Thus, they are more likely to detect changes that result from a treatment or intervention or reveal differences in subgroups of patients with a particular disease. As examples, the impact of food allergy may vary depending upon factors related to type of food, number of food allergies, severity of symptoms, threshold amount of the food needed to trigger a reaction, age or gender of the patient, or cross-cultural differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Validated HRQL questionnaires can be used to not only identify the QOL issues with which patients and families living with food allergy struggle, but can also identify the broader socioeconomic impact of food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This information can lead to initiatives to mitigate the negative effects of living with food allergy, including working with food manufacturers and the restaurant industry, educating the general public, and enacting legislative measures and regulatory interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1386074953\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF HRQL QUESTIONNAIRES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Validated food allergy-specific questionnaires can be used in the clinical setting to screen patients and their families for effect on HRQL that are great enough to interfere with normal psychologic development of the child <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> significantly impair activities of daily living for the child and family. Taking a thorough patient history can help to identify concerns. Discussing social activities that include food, approach to management of food allergies at school, and interactions with friends can help identify areas of concern that need intervention. Identification of these patients and their families can help direct the use of psychosocial services.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERIC INSTRUMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of food allergy on HRQL was first examined using generic instruments. These questionnaires revealed significant fear, anxiety, and restrictions in day-to-day activities associated with food allergy, especially in children and their families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In most cases, these effects were within the range expected for a potentially life-threatening disease. However, in some families, the impact was great enough to interfere with normal psychosocial development of the child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Findings from one small study suggested that food allergy has a greater impact on the HRQL of the parents than the affected child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The first well-designed study examining HRQL and food allergy compared the HRQL and family relations of children and adults with peanut allergy to those with rheumatologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The study included 153 children and 37 adults with peanut allergy and 69 children and 42 adults with rheumatologic disease. For both groups, age at recruitment was limited to less than 46 years to minimize comorbidity. The questionnaires used a visual analog scale (VAS) adapted from the European Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Impact on Family Life Questionnaire (IFQ).</p><p>The results were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The parents of peanut-allergic children reported that their children had significantly more disruption in their daily activities and greater impairment in normal social interactions within and outside of the family system compared with children with rheumatologic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversely, adults with a chronic rheumatologic disease reported more disruption in their family relations than adults with peanut allergy, although they reported comparable disruption to their overall HRQL.</p><p/><p>A second study used the Children's Health Questionnaire (CHQ-PF50) to measure parental perceptions of physical and psychosocial functioning in families of children aged 5 to 18 years with food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The CHQ-PF50 measures children's health issues related to 12 domains of physical, emotional, and social functioning. An additional, unvalidated, allergy-related questionnaire was included.</p><p>Questionnaires were sent to 400 members of the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, a lay organization for families living with food allergy. There was a response rate of 63 percent. Results of this study showed that childhood food allergy has a significant impact on HRQL for these families. It is possible that the study group was not entirely representative of all families of children with food allergy.</p><p>The following measures showed reduced scores compared with healthy controls in the United States population (a 10-point deficit is considered to be clinically relevant, and a lower score indicates a lower HRQL):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General health perception (59.3 versus 73.0)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotional impact on the parent (68.1 versus 80.3)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limitation on family activities (73.9 versus 89.7)</p><p/><p>Lower scores were associated with concomitant atopic disease and greater number of foods avoided. In one area, family cohesion, higher scores were seen in families living with food allergy compared with healthy controls.</p><p>There are limited HRQL studies in adults with food allergy. A Dutch study examined the influence of food allergy on daily life in and outside the home in adults with peanut, tree nut, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fruit allergy (oropharyngeal symptoms at a minimum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Impact on quality of life (QOL) was measured using a five-point scale. Sixty-three percent of patients rated their food allergy as influencing their daily life at home or outside the home to a very great, great, or important extent. There was no difference between patients with peanut-tree nut allergy only compared with patients with fruit allergy only.</p><p>There are several differences between food allergy and chronic illnesses that require treatment with daily medications, such as diabetes and rheumatologic disease. Although diabetes has a greater potential to cause long-term complications and impacts life expectancy, food allergy has a greater immediate impact on day-to-day functioning and HRQL. A daily insulin regimen to manage diabetes may be bothersome, but it gives patients some sense of control over their illness. Patients with food allergy live in a constant state of vigilance and uncertainty because of fear of exposure to the allergen.</p><p>Life-threatening events in food allergy are usually sudden in onset. The patient or <span class=\"nowrap\">parent/caregiver</span> is often the first responder when an acute event occurs. This is another significant burden for parents and other adults responsible for the care of the affected child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE-SPECIFIC INSTRUMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease-specific instruments have identified many HRQL issues confronted by patients and families with food allergy. Fear and anxiety are the biggest issues for preschool-aged children. Anxiety related to the potential risk of a reaction due to accidental ingestion of a food allergen appears to have a more profound impact on emotional and social aspects of a child's everyday life than the effect of an actual allergic reaction triggered by a food allergen. Social and dietary limitations have the strongest impact on HRQL for school-aged children with food allergy. There is a greater negative impact on the quality of life (QOL) of children and their families when the child has multiple food allergies. All activities involving potential exposure to food are affected (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">school/daycare,</span> vacation, camp, dining out, social gatherings). Food allergies have the least impact on HRQL in teenagers, although their lack of fear may put them at greater risk for a life-threatening reaction. Mothers often note a greater impact on their HRQL than even the child with food allergies and may overestimate the effect on the child.</p><p>In contrast to generic tools to measure HRQL, disease-specific questionnaires are more sensitive and responsive to issues specific to the disease under study. These tools can identify differences between subgroups, such as children with multiple food allergies versus those with a single food allergy. Several food allergy-specific questionnaires are available, although most still require longitudinal validation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Food allergy-specific questionnaires have not yet been used longitudinally to determine the impact of interventions on HRQL, although this is one of the major goals of these instruments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1100615077\"><span class=\"h2\">Parent/caregiver questionnaires</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This type of questionnaire is answered by the <span class=\"nowrap\">parent/caregiver</span>. Some focus on parental assessment of the impact of the food allergy on the child, while others examine the effect of the child's food allergy on the <span class=\"nowrap\">parent/family</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Food Allergy Quality of Life - Parental Burden (FAQL-PB)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first validated food allergy-specific questionnaire was developed to measure parental burden in families with a child with food allergy (FAQL-PB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>This instrument showed the ability to discriminate by disease burden. Parents whose children had greater than two food allergies were more affected than parents whose children had fewer allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Poorer HRQL was also seen in caregivers who were more knowledgeable about food allergy, whose children were seen in the emergency department in the past year for food allergy, or who had children with milk or wheat allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Many domains that affect families living with food allergy were identified during the development of this questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family and social activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>School and camp</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social activities that involve food</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vacation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating in restaurants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finding appropriate childcare</p><p/><p>Parents worried about health and nutritional concerns for their children and were concerned about treating a food-induced allergic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Feelings such as anxiety, frustration, and sadness were common among parents of children with food allergies. A consistent concern of caregivers was social limitations resulting from their child's food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>A pilot study used the FAQL-PB to determine if a self-regulation intervention for parents of children with food allergies was effective in improving parental HRQL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The intervention addressed parental concerns, goals, and barriers and involved discussion of coping mechanisms and strategies to overcome barriers. Greater improvements were seen in the intervention group compared with the control group in 4 of 17 questionnaire factors that involved frustration, helplessness, anxiety, and confidence.</p><p>The FAQL-PB was also used to evaluate QOL in caregivers of patients with food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) since there is no disease-specific tool to measure this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. FPIES is a non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy. Symptoms can include severe vomiting, lethargy, and diarrhea that can potentially lead to shock occurring one to four hours after ingesting the offending food. Unlike IgE-mediated food allergy, no diagnostic tests are available, and diagnosis is based solely on clinical criteria. Standard treatments such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and antihistamines are not effective in treating a FPIES reaction. FPIES primarily responds to intravenous fluid resuscitation. The FAQL-PB index was administered to 68 FPIES caregivers attending a FPIES advocacy conference. Responses were compared with a cohort of caregivers of children with IgE-mediated food allergy. The FAQL-PB was reliable and valid for assessing HRQL in the setting of FPIES.

This scale is not validated.</p><p>This instrument was tested on 101 caregivers of children with food allergy ages 8 months to 17 years recruited from a university-based allergy clinic (response rate 86 percent). Most surveys were completed during the clinic visit, providing information that this 15-minute survey can be incorporated into clinical practice.</p><p>The study demonstrated that food allergy has a significant impact on the daily activities of children and their families and increases parental stress level. Specific findings from this work include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over 60 percent of parents indicated that food allergy significantly impacted meal preparation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Half of caregivers reported that food allergy affected family social activities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-third of caregivers reported that food allergy affected their child's school attendance.

It includes nine items in three areas: HRQL, social impact, and <span class=\"nowrap\">crises/conflicts</span>. This scale is not validated.</p><p>Initial testing of this survey found that higher scores on the SPS-FA were associated with higher depression and anxiety indices. Elevated levels of depression and anxiety were seen in the study population compared with the general population.

Items are based upon clinical experience working with food-allergic children and their families. With further development, the FAPQ may be a practical tool to use in assessing needs of parents living with a child with food allergy.</p><p>In a preliminary study, a total of 221 parents of children up to 18 years of age with food allergy were recruited from a private allergy practice and local food allergy support groups (response rate 87 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Approximately 70 percent of children had more than one food allergy, and over one-half had a history of anaphylaxis.

Different questionnaires have been designed for young children, teenagers, and adults that address issues specific to each age group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H224630271\"><span class=\"h3\">Pediatric Food Allergy Quality of Life (PFA-QL) questionnaire</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PFA-QL questionnaire was the first tool developed for assessing HRQL in children with food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It was used in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>] and was later validated, along with the parent proxy version (parent form) of the scale (PFA-QL-PF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These questionnaires have only been used in children with peanut <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tree nut allergies.</p><p>The first use of the PFA-QL was in a survey performed in the United Kingdom to evaluate the QOL of 20 children with peanut allergy (mean age nine years) compared with 20 children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (mean age 10.4 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Both groups of children had chronic, potentially life-threatening disorders with management that impacted diet and related activities, allowing for use of the same issue-specific (although not exactly disease-specific) questionnaires in both groups. The inclusion criterion included an allergic reaction to peanuts or a hypoglycemic episode. Subjects were recruited from allergy and diabetes clinics or by mail from established clinic records. Two unvalidated questionnaires were used, one designed by the researchers (questionnaire 1) and one adapted from the Vespid Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire (questionnaire 2). In addition, subjects were given a disposable camera to record how their HRQL was affected over a 24-hour period.</p><p>Questionnaire response rate for both groups was 100 percent. Cameras were used and returned by 16 children with peanut allergy and 19 with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Pictures taken were placed in categories: food, management, environment, physical activities, restaurant, away from home, and people. Overall, HRQL was significantly more impaired in children with peanut allergy than with diabetes.</p><p>The following results were found:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with peanut allergy reported a lower HRQL than children with diabetes (54.8 versus 46.4 for questionnaire 1, and 54.3 versus 34.5 for questionnaire 2). In this study, a higher score indicated a lower HRQL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five children with peanut allergy reported that they were either very scared or extremely scared of accidentally eating peanuts, while children with diabetes indicated they were only moderately scared or less about having a hypoglycemic attack.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two of the children with peanut allergy reported to be scared of dying when they knew that peanuts were nearby. Children with diabetes commented on food restrictions, but none mentioned fear of death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with peanut allergy described being constantly aware of allergens and felt more threatened by potential hazards in their environment. They were more anxious about being away from home, especially eating away from home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical activities were restricted to a greater extent in children with peanut allergy than children with diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All of the children with peanut allergy and 85 percent of the children with diabetes photographed food-related issues, primarily related to difficulties regarding food restrictions.</p><p/><p>In the two subsequent studies using the PFA-QL and the PFA-QL-PF, notable findings included the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with peanut <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tree nut allergies had poorer emotional, social, physical, and psychological QOL than did their siblings or compared with normative data.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mothers reported greater anxiety and stress, as well as poorer physical and psychological HRQL than fathers. In addition, mothers appeared to overestimate the impact of food allergy on the child compared with the degree of impact reported by fathers, siblings, and the child with food allergy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Receipt of prescriptions for autoinjectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> was associated with lower anxiety in the mother and child.

In addition, the same three questions had the greatest impact. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire - Child Form (FAQLQ-CF)'</a> above.)</p><p>This instrument was able to distinguish between adolescents with more than two food allergies and those allergic to only one food but was unable to discriminate between those with and without a history of anaphylaxis.</p><p>Investigation of construct validity using expectation of outcome (EO) questions revealed that the EO question &quot;chance of dying when accidentally exposed&quot; did not correlate with any of the &quot;teenager form&quot; items. Thus, fear of dying did not appear to be a significant component in teenagers. This finding was consistent with other studies that have noted that adolescents felt that their food-induced anaphylaxis was &quot;no big deal&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

In addition, other studies have shown that teenagers take greater risks with their food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] and are at higher risk of death from food allergy than other age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stress that families living with food allergy experience is important to explore in providing care. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Health-related quality of life'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Results from generic questionnaires reveal that the constant vigilance required for food allergen avoidance and fear of a life-threatening reaction cause significant anxiety and lead to restricted daily activities. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Generic instruments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several validated food allergy-specific HRQL questionnaires and additional unvalidated questionnaires in development. The Food Allergy Quality of Life - Parental Burden (FAQL-PB) measures parental burden; the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire &ndash; Parent Form (FAQLQ-PF) evaluates effects of food allergy on the child as perceived by the parent. FAQLQ&ndash; child and teenager forms (FAQLQ-CF and FAQLQ-TF) are self-administered tools that measure the impact of food allergy on children (aged 8 to 12 years) and teenagers (aged 13 to 17 years), respectively. The Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire - Teen Form (FAQLQ-teen) is a similar tool that assesses the impact of food allergy in adolescents aged 13 to 19 years. The FAQLQ-AF (adult form) is a self-administered tool that measures the impact of food allergy on adults. The Pediatric Food Allergy Quality of Life (PFA-QL) questionnaire and the parent proxy version (parent form) of the scale (PFA-QL-PF) evaluate the effects of peanut <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tree nut allergy on the child and parent. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Disease-specific instruments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a greater negative impact on the HRQL of children and their families when the child has multiple food allergies. All activities involving potential exposure to food are affected (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">school/daycare,</span> vacation, camp, dining out, social gatherings). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Disease-specific instruments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety related to the potential risk of a reaction due to accidental ingestion of a food allergen appears to have a more profound impact on emotional and social aspects of a child's everyday life than the effect of an actual allergic reaction triggered by a food allergen. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Disease-specific instruments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear and anxiety are the most important issues for preschool-aged children. Social and dietary limitations have the strongest impact on HRQL for school-aged children with food allergy. Food allergies have the least impact on HRQL in teenagers, although their lack of fear may put them at greater risk for a life-threatening reaction.
