The humoral immune response denotes immunologic responses that are mediated by antibodies. However, both B and T lymphocytes as well as dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells are necessary for the formation of antigen-specific antibody.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H740652713\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Natural antibodies&quot; are so-called because they are produced naturally, without any antigen exposure. Vertebrate animals, even in germ-free environments, produce natural antibodies. For human infants, these antibodies, along with maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) that is transported across the placenta into the fetus in the third trimester of gestation, are important for protection of the newborn. Immediately after birth, neonates leave a sterile environment and are bombarded by microbes and other antigens. Therefore, antigen-stimulated antibody production is rapidly superimposed on natural antibodies. However, that process takes time (months) and in the interim, natural antibody and maternal antibody are important.</p><p>Natural antibodies are often polyspecific, meaning that they react with multiple endogenous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exogenous antigens bearing no readily identifiable structural similarity (eg, histones, polynucleotides, other immunoglobulins). Some recognize &quot;oxidation-specific&quot; epitopes, which are epitopes generated during the oxidative processes involved in metabolism, aging, and inflammation. These epitopes are ubiquitous on both microbes and aging and apoptotic host cells and represent a class of pathogen- or damage-associated molecular pattern (PAMP or DAMP) recognized by receptors of the innate immune system. Thus, natural antibodies appear to function as a type of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) for these molecular structures. Natural antibodies are primarily of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype. They are produced by a distinct subset of B cells known as B-1 cells, which produce antibody without any requirement of prior antigenic stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Natural antibodies appear to have at least two important functions. The first is to provide early protection against infections with a rapid immune response against pathogens, before more specific antibodies can be produced. The second role is assisting in homeostasis by binding to aging and apoptotic cells and cellular debris, which if not cleared, could create a proinflammatory and immunogenic environment. Natural antibodies are discussed further elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Humoral immunity includes the primary and secondary immune responses to antigen. During the primary immune response, an antigen is encountered by the host for the first time. Virgin B cells need to be activated and proliferate before an effective antibody response can be generated. This primary antibody response may be too slow to protect against many pathogens, therefore polyspecific natural antibodies with low affinity and the innate immune system may be utilized to limit microbial replication at the onset of infection. By comparison, the secondary antibody response, which results from the activation of a memory B cell, is faster and more effective in halting the progress of infection due to increased antibody-binding affinities.</p><p>Vaccination induces a primary immune response so that the patient produces the faster and more effective secondary response upon natural exposure to a pathogen, and is one of the most important contributions of immunology to disease prevention.</p><p>An overview of the humoral immune response will be provided here. Discussions of immunoglobulin structure, function, and genetics, as well as a review of B cell development, are found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PASSIVE AND ACTIVE HUMORAL IMMUNITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Passive humoral immunity is the acquisition of preformed antibodies from an external source, such as the administration of intramuscular or intravenous human immunoglobulin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary immunodeficiency: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Passive immunity is naturally acquired during human gestation by the transplacental transfer of maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) are not transported across the placenta, and the neonate has only small quantities of these isotypes in its circulation. After birth, the breastfed neonate continues to receive IgA passively via colostrum and breast milk, which affords local protection in the gut, and to some extent, the upper respiratory tract. Breast milk immunoglobulins are not absorbed by the infant's gastrointestinal tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody levels in infancy and childhood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants develop the ability to respond to most antigenic challenges during the first few years of life. The figure shows the pattern of serum IgG levels in the first five years of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73913\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73913 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG &ndash; Maternal IgG in the infant is lost with a half life of 20 to 30 days, such that little maternal IgG or antibody is present by six months of age. The infant's own IgG rises gradually throughout the first year of life. These two changes occur simultaneously, resulting in a period from three to eight months of life during which the IgG levels are low. This is called physiologic hypogammaglobulinemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgM and IgA &ndash; Traces of IgM are synthesized by the infant. IgM levels increase rapidly during the first month of life, and then rise slowly thereafter to about 70 percent of adult levels by one year of age. IgA levels, generally absent at birth, gradually increase throughout the first year of life to about 30 percent of adult levels at one year. Adult levels of IgM and IgA are reached in adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-iga-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective IgA deficiency: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Normal biology of IgA'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Active (or adaptive) immunity is the response generated during the encounter of the immune system with antigen. This may occur during the course of a natural infection or after intentional antigen administration (vaccination).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIGEN-DEPENDENT B CELL DEVELOPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several distinct processes occur during the antigen-dependent phase of B cell development, including activation, proliferation, and differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These are mentioned briefly here and discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation &ndash; The first distinct step in antigen-dependent B cell development is activation. Activation specifically refers to the resumption of the cell cycle or the exit of the cell from its resting state.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proliferation &ndash; One of the consequences of activation is proliferation, during which the cells begin to divide. Proliferation is simply an increase in cell number without associated changes in the morphology or biochemistry of the cell.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differentiation &ndash; Differentiation refers to the changes occurring in B cells that determine development into memory cells or antibody-producing plasma cells. The generation of many cells from one resting B cell is called clonal expansion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTIVATION SIGNALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>B cells require two signals to become activated and begin differentiating into memory or plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cross-linking of immunoglobulin receptor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first signal (often called signal 1) may be delivered via cross-linking of the immunoglobulin receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most soluble protein and glycoprotein antigens are monovalent and cannot cross-link immunoglobulin receptors alone; however, immunoglobulin receptor cross-linking may not be required in all responses to thymus-dependent (TD) antigens, even though the degree to which it occurs may affect the quality of the immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In contrast, immunoglobulin receptor cross-linking is important in responses to type 2 antigens with many repeating determinants, which do not require cognate T cell help. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Types of antigens'</a> below.)</p><p>Low affinity interactions with multispecific natural antibody can form immune complexes that may also contain complement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These complexes could cross-link immunoglobulin receptors and also provide a second signal to B cells via CD21 (ie, the C3d complement fragment receptor). CD21 lowers the threshold for B cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Immune complexes could also be trapped on the surfaces of immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc receptor-bearing cells, such as dendritic cells in various lymphoid tissues (spleen, lymph node, Peyer's patches). These cell-bound complexes might be even more effective at aggregating B cell immunoglobulin receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>As described below, the second signal (signal 2) may be derived from cytokine(s) or from other cell surface interactions in different circumstances depending largely on the type of antigen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF ANTIGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the context of the humoral immune response, antigens capable of activating B cells may be categorized into three groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thymus-independent type 1</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thymus-independent type 2</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thymus-dependent (TD) antigens</p><p/><p>The first two groups are often referred to simply as type 1 or type 2 antigens. These types of antigens give rise to relatively low affinity antibody responses. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) often predominates, although other isotypes (immunoglobulin G [IgG], immunoglobulin A [IgA]) may also be produced. Immunologic memory is often weak or short-lived. In contrast, TD antigens tend to lead to the generation of higher affinity antibodies and lasting immunologic memory.</p><p>Although these categories of antigens serve as convenient descriptive labels when discussing mechanisms of B cell activation, they should not be considered restrictive or mutually-exclusive. An antigen may behave as type 1, type 2, or TD depending upon its chemical state, associated molecules, or the dose.</p><p>These designations are derived principally from studies of antibody responses in mice. In humans, T cell participation appears to be more consistently required in the responses to most antigens, although the nature of the signals required varies with the type of antigen. The classification is also useful because of the different ways these molecules may interact with B cells directly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 1 antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 1 antigens are molecules of microbial or vegetal origin that bind to B cells and stimulate their proliferation and differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These substances are polyclonal activators, or <strong>mitogens</strong>, since they stimulate B cells independent of their antigen specificity.</p><p>B cell mitogens are usually polymers containing a repeating structural unit. Many are polysaccharides, lectins, or proteins that agglutinate cells or precipitate certain macromolecules. The receptor(s) responsible for the mitogenic effect in many instances are not known. A potent mitogen for human B cells is Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain (SAC), which contains bacterial protein A that aggregates surface immunoglobulin receptors. Another human B cell mitogen is a plant lectin, pokeweed mitogen (PWM).</p><p>At low concentrations, B cell mitogens stimulate specific antibody responses (ie, only antibodies to the mitogen). At higher concentrations, mitogens induce B cell proliferation independent of antigen specificity. The action of mitogens on human B cells appears to require some participation of T cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The mitogen may induce early stages in activation, rendering a B cell receptive to additional stimulatory signals provided by T cells.</p><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has unique properties as an antigen because it is able to transform some B cells (ie, render them malignant) independent of the usual regulatory factors, including T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>]. The EBV receptor (also called CD21 or complement receptor 2 [CR2]), is the receptor for this complement fragment and B cell growth factor C3d. Transformation by EBV enables B cells to become antibody-secreting cells. Cultures of EBV-transformed B cells can be used to develop an immortal cell line that is used in genetic studies as it is an unlimited source of the patient's DNA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-epstein-barr-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of Epstein-Barr virus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulators and receptors of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 2 antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 2 antigens elicit predominantly antigen-specific antibody responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Many type 2 antigens are similar to type 1 antigens in having repeating structures. Certain plant and bacterial polysaccharides are good examples. The Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide is a clinically important type 2 antigen. These antigens are able to cross-link specific immunoglobulin receptors on B cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal vaccination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Neonatal B cells are poorly responsive to type 2 antigens, a fact that limits the utility of polysaccharide vaccines in young children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessing the immunologic response to vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surface immunoglobulin cross-linking alone (in most cases) is not sufficient to induce B cell proliferation and differentiation, although it renders B cells receptive to T cell signals (cytokines) that further stimulate their progression toward antibody-secreting cells. In this setting, T helper cells do <strong>not</strong> need to make physical contact with B cells. This is referred to as <strong>noncognate T cell help</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">TACI, BAFF, and APRIL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One mechanism for activation and isotype switching is mediated by two B cell receptors: transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cytophilic ligand interactor (TACI) and B cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family receptor (BAFF-R). The ligands, B cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) and A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), can bind and stimulate both receptors resulting in isotype-switch recombination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These receptors appear to be essential for antibody responses to type 2 antigens, based on murine TACI knockout models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Furthermore, some patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) carry mutations in TACI, although its significance is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of common variable immunodeficiency&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional activating signals</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibody binding to the immunoglobulin receptor &ndash; As may be expected, anti-immunoglobulin antibodies activate B cells regardless of their antigen specificity. This activation requires cross-linking of surface immunoglobulin, since monovalent anti-immunoglobulin Fab fragments are not activating, while bivalent F(ab)'2 fragments are. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-of-immunoglobulins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure of immunoglobulins&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibody directed against one of several B cell surface molecules (such as the immunoglobulin receptors themselves or class II histocompatibility molecules) binds to that molecule. Antibodies binding various surface molecules, such as CD20, CD21, and CD22, may have modulatory effects on B cell activation, in combination with other signals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Binding of toll-like receptors (TLRs) on B cells by their ligands can activate B cells in isolation or synergistically with other signals. An important example is unmethylated CpG DNA which binds to TLR9 and is present in bacterial genomes. This ligand can induce activation and isotype-switching in B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Thymus-dependent antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of protein and glycoprotein antigens encountered by the immune system are TD antigens. Antibody production requires close collaboration between T and B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>With antibody responses to TD antigens, two types of cellular interaction are required:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first, T cells recognize antigen associated with histocompatibility molecules on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. After the T cell is activated, it becomes capable of providing help to a B cell for antibody production (ie, it becomes a T helper, or Th &quot;effector&quot; cell).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second interaction is between a B cell and the Th cell. Via the immunoglobulin receptor, B cells internalize antigen. It is then processed and associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, as with any antigen-presenting cell. This action is necessary for a Th cell to be able to recognize the appropriate B cells to which it will deliver its stimulating signals.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognate T cell help</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second signal for B cell activation is delivered via intimate membrane contacts with a T helper cell, sometimes called cognate T cell help [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This interaction involves a variety of receptors and ligands expressed by both cells. Several of these surface proteins are adhesion molecules that facilitate intimate cellular contact. Many of these also have important roles in initiating and propagating stimulatory biochemical mechanisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">CD40 and CD40 ligand</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One important pathway of activation is the interaction between a pair of molecules, CD40 on the B cell, and CD154 (also called CD40 ligand or CD40L) on an activated T cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Binding CD40 on the B cell is critical for immunoglobulin class-switching, antibody affinity maturation, and formation of memory B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Defects in CD154 lead to the X-linked hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome, a severe immunodeficiency characterized, in part, by a relative inability of B cells to switch from IgM to IgG or IgA production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperimmunoglobulin M syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Anergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although all of the activating signals for B cell proliferation and differentiation are not yet known, it is clear that several mechanisms operate in concert, and that more than one type of signal is required. As already discussed, cross-linking of surface immunoglobulin receptors constitutes one type of B cell activation signal. However, in the absence of additional signals, the B cell will not become activated. In fact, immunoglobulin receptor cross-linking without further stimuli renders B cells anergic, ie, unable to respond to future activating signals. This may be an important mechanism of B cell tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Once a sufficient set of activating signals are received, the B cell then begins to differentiate into either a plasma cell or a memory cell.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune complexes and Fc regions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immune complexes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunoglobulin Fc regions have been shown either to activate or suppress B cells independently of antigen, or stimulate or inhibit specific antigen responses. The variable responses that result depend upon the character of the immune complexes <span class=\"nowrap\">(antigen/antibody</span> ratio), the timing of administration (before, with, or after antigen), and the isotype of the antibodies in the complex (IgG versus IgM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Antigen-specific antibodies administered passively with antigen may suppress immune responses by masking the antigen and interfering with its recognition (binding) by B cells, or by interfering with T-B cell cooperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In some experiments, however, passively administered antibodies can enhance antigen-specific responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This may occur by forming stimulating immune complexes, or by enhancing antigen uptake by Fc receptors of antigen-presenting cells.</p><p>Some forms of immune complexes may be suppressive for B cells. As an example, the simultaneous cross-linking of the immunoglobulin receptor and the Fc receptor Fc-gamma-RII (CD32) on B cells suppresses B cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">CELLULAR EVENTS IN B CELL ACTIVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several pathways by which resting B cells become activated and begin proliferating, as discussed previously.

Protein kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases, respectively, phosphorylate and dephosphorylate their various substrates. Phosphorylation (or dephosphorylation) of the intracellular domain of a membrane protein enables its association with other signal-transducing molecules. Some important B cell surface molecules that may be reversibly tyrosine-phosphorylated include the immunoglobulin-alpha and immunoglobulin-beta components of the immunoglobulin receptor, CD19 and CD22. Phosphorylation of these molecules permits their association with other kinases or adapter proteins and initiates activation. Many kinases and phosphatases are themselves substrates of other kinases and phosphatases, and are regulated by phosphorylation. Detailed reviews of the multitude of intracellular signaling pathways in B cell activation have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">GERMINAL CENTERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Germinal centers (GCs) are the areas within lymph nodes and the spleen in which B cell maturation occurs and the cellular events responsible for immunologic memory take place. Within GCs, B cells develop into plasma cells capable of producing high affinity antibodies, or into memory B cells devoted to transporting the &quot;experience&quot; of the immune system around the body and permitting more rapid antibody production when the same antigen is encountered in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Within the peripheral lymphoid tissues, B cells that have not yet been exposed to antigen form spherical collections of cells called primary lymphoid follicles. These primary follicles contain follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), interspersed with small resting B cells. The FDCs present antigen-antibody complexes on their surface, which stimulate B cell growth and differentiation. In the first days after exposure to antigen in T-dependent immune responses (through vaccination, for example), B cell activation begins outside of lymphoid follicles. In one model, interdigitating cells, T helper (Th) cells, and B cells were shown to interact in the marginal zones of the spleen.</p><p>The primary lymphoid follicle then becomes populated with a small number (three, on average) of B cells that will give rise to all of the progeny cells of that GC. The preexisting resting B cells are pushed to the periphery of the follicle to form the follicular mantle. The incoming B cells have already received some combination of activating signals from antigen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T cells in the periphery prior to their arrival in the newly-forming GC. These cells are able to take up and process antigen from the follicular cell surface. They then present it to Th cells, which deliver further activating signals and drive development. The germinal center is thus made up of activated and proliferating B cells, FDCs, as well as a small number of T cells and macrophages. The GC with its surrounding resting B cells is called a secondary lymphoid follicle.</p><p>B cell differentiation within GC is highly regulated and compartmentalized. B cells migrate to one end of the lymphoid follicle to form the dark zone of the germinal center, where they become centroblasts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77980\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77980 \">figure 2</a>). These centroblasts continue to divide and give rise to centrocytes that migrate to the basal light zone. Somatic mutation of immunoglobulin V genes then takes place during cell division and selection of centrocytes. If they are able to interact with antigen, they migrate to the apical light zone. If not, they die (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57024 \">figure 3</a>). The cells with receptors having the highest affinity for antigen have a selective advantage and will dominate the response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Three possible fates are hypothesized for B cells surviving to enter the apical light zone of the germinal center: terminal differentiation to plasma cells, terminal differentiation to memory cells, or reentry to the dark zone to undergo further division and mutation.</p><p>Two signals are important for ensuring the survival of B cells within germinal centers: one is the cross-linking of immunoglobulin receptors by antigen complexed on FDC and the other is the interaction of B cell CD40 with its ligand CD154 on a T cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>] (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cognate T cell help'</a> above). The CD40 signal is critical for driving somatic mutation and class-switching. Somatic mutation followed by selection based upon antibody affinity leads to the increased affinity seen in ongoing antibody responses and in the memory response. Class-switching permits the production of antibodies displaying a diverse array of effector mechanisms, such as neutralization, complement fixation, etc. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOLOGIC MEMORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immune response in a person that has never before encountered a given antigen is called a primary immune response, as discussed previously. The immune response in a person that has at least one prior exposure to the antigen is called a secondary immune response.</p><p>Following antigen exposure, there is a lag period before antibody is detectable. This period corresponds to the cellular events in the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of B cells to antibody-secreting cells.</p><p>Primary and secondary responses differ with respect to the lag period, the magnitude and duration of the response, and the isotypes and affinity of antibodies produced (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71886\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71886 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. The actual duration of the lag period and the speed with which antibodies are then produced varies, depending on the dose of antigen, route of administration, and whether the antigen persists in the body or is cleared.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the primary response to a thymus-dependent (TD) antigen, there is a logarithmic increase in serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies from 4 to 10 days. This increase reflects clonal expansion and antibody production. Clonal expansion is associated with immunoglobulin class-switching so that the proportion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) (and other isotypes) increases with time. Somatic mutation also occurs, producing antibodies of higher affinity later in the response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Na&iuml;ve B cells that have not yet encountered antigen express IgM and IgD on their surface, but are negative for CD27, a receptor that is important in T cell co-stimulation. Thus, these na&iuml;ve B cells are CD27-IgM+IgD+.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Affinity maturation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each cycle of division within a germinal center leads to selection of cells having the receptors with the highest affinity for antigen. This phenomenon is called affinity maturation. Thus, the secondary antibody repertoire, established after an encounter of the immune system with antigen, consists of clones derived from the primary (virgin B cell) repertoire that have been expanded via a diversification process of somatic mutation with selection for cells with high affinity for antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].</p><p>As antigen is cleared from the body, the immune response gradually wanes. Persistence of antigen leads to ongoing antibody production. Some antigens are capable of inducing long-lasting antibody production, even after they are cleared (eg, measles virus). The mechanism for this is not known. Such antigens may persist in particular sites, allowing continued stimulation of B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Alternatively, these antigens may stimulate the development of particularly long-lived antibody-producing cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The memory B cell, or plasma cell, is the hallmark of acquired humoral immunity. Memory is generated predominantly for T-dependent antigens, although it can also be obtained with type 2 antigens. Memory B cells are morphologically similar to small resting lymphocytes. They usually display IgG, IgA, or IgE on their surface, although some have IgM. They generally lack IgD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>Memory B cells can be identified by the presence of CD27. Memory B cells can be subdivided into those cells that have not yet undergone isotype switching and produce predominantly IgM (CD27+IgM+IgD+), and those that have isotype switched (CD27+IgM-IgD-) and synthesize IgG, IgM, or IgA. Defects in these stages of maturation can result in immunodeficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of common variable immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Memory cells circulate actively from blood to lymph and survive for much longer periods of time between mitoses (years or decades). They preferentially populate mucosal areas where they are more likely to come into contact with foreign antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Memory cells are thought to constitute only about 1 percent of the total B cell population. Memory B cells disappear after 10 to 12 weeks without continued antigenic stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, many persist for longer periods due to continued antigenic stimulation and they can be very long-lived, surviving for several decades.</p><p>The secondary humoral response is characterized by a much shorter lag period and the rapid production of isotypes other than IgM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71886\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71886 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. These rapidly appearing IgG, IgA, or IgE molecules have high affinity for antigen and are derived from memory cells developed in the primary response. By virtue of their immunoglobulins receptors' high affinity for antigen, memory cells are stimulated by much lower antigen concentrations than are virgin B cells. In addition, memory cells are more efficient at antigen presentation and are more receptive to T cell help [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In some cases, memory cells may not require T cells for activation.</p><p>Memory cells which proliferate outside of germinal centers do not undergo any further somatic mutation in their immunoglobulin V genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Some cells may reenter germinal centers where they may undergo further rounds of somatic mutation and antigen selection for higher affinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-humoral-immune-response/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The humoral immune response denotes immunologic responses that are mediated by antibodies.

After infancy, the child's immunoglobulins gradually increase as levels of maternal antibodies wane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73913\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73913 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antibody levels in infancy and childhood'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies are produced when B cells encounter antigen and respond by undergoing activation, proliferation, and differentiation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Antigen-dependent B cell development'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antigens may be categorized as type 1 (mitogens), type 2 (antigens which stimulate specific B cells and generate specific antibody production), and T cell-dependent antigens (thymus-dependent [TD] antigens, or antigens which require extensive interaction between B and T cells to generate antibodies). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Types of antigens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B cells require two signals to become activated and begin differentiating into memory or plasma cells. The first is cross-linking of their surface immunoglobulin receptors, and the second is cognate T cell help, which refers to activating interactions between B and T cells via one of several receptor-ligand pairs. If both activating signals are not received, the B cell may respond with anergy to that antigen. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Activation signals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Germinal centers are the areas within lymph nodes and the spleen in which B cell maturation occurs and the cellular events responsible for immunologic memory take place (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77980\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77980 \">figure 2</a>). Within germinal centers, B cells develop into plasma cells capable of producing high affinity antibodies, as well as into memory B cells devoted to monitoring the body for subsequent exposures to the same antigen. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Germinal centers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once antigen enters the body and interacts with the immune system, there is an initial lag period during which B cells become activated and then proliferate and differentiate into antibody-producing plasma cells. The primary immune response has a relatively long lag (usually between 4 and 10 days), and results in the production of mostly immunoglobulin M (IgM). Memory B cells are also produced during the primary immune response. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Primary immune response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory B cells may live for many years, circulating around the body (particularly mucosal surfaces) in search of antigen. Upon encountering antigen, they rapidly begin to produce specific antibody. The secondary immune response has a shorter lag period and results in the production of greater amounts of IgG (or sometimes IgA or IgE) antibodies, with higher antigen affinity compared with those made in the primary immune response.
