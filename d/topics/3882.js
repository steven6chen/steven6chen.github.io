In developed countries, viral infection is the most frequently presumed cause of myocarditis. In the 1980s and 1990s, enteroviruses (Coxsackie B and others) were frequently associated with myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. In the past 10 years, however, other viruses, including adenovirus, parvovirus B19, hepatitis C, and herpes virus 6, have emerged as significant pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In many developing countries, rheumatic carditis, Chagas disease, and disorders associated with advanced HIV are important causes of myocarditis. </p><p>Although histology remains the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis of myocarditis, low-risk patients are often presumed to have myocarditis on the basis of a compatible clinical scenario, suggesting new onset inflammatory cardiomyopathy and cardiovascular magnetic resonance features without an endomyocardial biopsy. However, clinical features at presentation in myocarditis are polymorphic and there is no sign, symptom, or constellation of clinical features that is diagnostic of acute or <span class=\"nowrap\">subacute/chronic</span> myocarditis. </p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis will be reviewed here. The etiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89272080\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium. As discussed below, the World Health <span class=\"nowrap\">Organization/International</span> Society and Federation of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(WHO/ISFC)</span> definition specifies diagnosis by established histological (Dallas criteria), immunological, and immunohistochemical criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], though many patients with clinical manifestations of myocarditis do not undergo endomyocardial biopsy so a definitive diagnosis is not established. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Dallas criteria'</a> below and <a href=\"#H89271944\" class=\"local\">'WHO/ISFC definition'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Endomyocardial biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as myocarditis accompanied by cardiac dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Inflammatory cardiomyopathy can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy or other cardiomyopathies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H524912\"><span class=\"h3\">Variable presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of myocarditis are highly variable ranging from subclinical disease to fatigue, chest pain, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and sudden death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66776\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66776 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. There is no population-based epidemiologic study that has defined presenting symptoms of acute or <span class=\"nowrap\">subacute/chronic</span> myocarditis; this is due in part to the absence of a safe and sensitive noninvasive diagnostic test that can confirm the diagnosis. </p><p>The variability in presentation reflects the variability in histological disease severity, etiology, and disease stage at presentation. Myocardial inflammation may be focal or diffuse, involving any or all cardiac chambers. Severe, diffuse myocarditis can result in acute dilated cardiomyopathy. The histological features of chronic myocarditis are usually more subtle, and include altered human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and adhesion molecule expression, and inflammatory cell infiltrates that are apparent only on cell specific immunostains (ie, CD3 for T lymphocytes and CD68 for macrophages) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Early studies suggested that cardiac involvement may have occurred in 3.5 to 5 percent of patients during outbreaks of coxsackievirus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, there is significant difficulty in establishing a diagnosis of myocarditis because endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is not performed in many suspected cases and there is no noninvasive &quot;gold standard.&quot; The sensitivity of EMB using conventional histology (Dallas criteria) for myocarditis may be as low as 10 to 35 percent due to variability in interpretation and sampling error, but application of immunohistochemistry and viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have yielded higher sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Endomyocardial biopsy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many cases of myocarditis likely go undetected because they are subclinical or present with nonspecific signs. For example, the rate of troponin rise after smallpox vaccination is 1:200, yet the rate of clinically suspected myocarditis has been reported to be approximately 1:5500 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Subtle cardiac symptoms and signs may be overshadowed by systemic manifestations of the underlying infection or disease process. In the early stages of viral myocarditis, for example, the patient may have fever, myalgias, and muscle tenderness. The muscle symptoms are attributable to myositis induced by a myotropic virus such as coxsackievirus A. In the United States Myocarditis Treatment Trial, 89 percent of subjects reported a syndrome consistent with a viral prodrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many symptomatic cases of postviral or lymphocytic myocarditis present with a syndrome of heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy. In a large review of 1230 cases of initially unexplained cardiomyopathy in the United States, 9 percent were thought to be due to myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A similar prevalence (10 percent) was noted in the Myocarditis Treatment Trial in which EMB was performed in over 2200 patients with unexplained heart failure of less than two years duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In many patients who develop heart failure, fatigue and decreased exercise capacity are the initial manifestations. However, rapidly evolving diffuse, severe myocarditis can result in acute myocardial failure and cardiogenic shock. Signs of right ventricular failure include increased jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema. Patients with predominant left ventricular involvement, present with symptoms of pulmonary congestion including dyspnea, orthopnea, pulmonary rales, and, in severe cases, acute pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute decompensated heart failure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest pain may reflect associated pericarditis. Myocarditis can mimic myocardial ischemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infarction both symptomatically and on the electrocardiogram, particularly in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/12,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21-24</a>]. Elevated troponin in the setting of pericarditis is often due to epicardial inflammation and termed &quot;myopericarditis.&quot; Heart failure and sudden death are rare in this condition, but recurrent myocarditis occurs in approximately 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myopericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myopericarditis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>As an example, in one study of 45 patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome with a normal coronary angiogram, 35 (78 percent) had a diffuse or focal myocarditis on myocardial imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Complete recovery of left ventricular function occurred at six months in 81 percent of these patients. Focal wall motion abnormalities associated with myocarditis may be due to localized inflammation or ischemia caused by coronary spasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In an autopsy series of patients under age 40 who presented with sudden death in the absence of known heart disease, myocarditis was responsible for 22 percent of cases under age 30 and 11 percent in older subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In another autopsy study of sudden death occurring in competitive athletes, myocarditis was present in 6 percent of cardiovascular deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a series of autopsies in military recruits, myocarditis accounted for 20 percent of deaths due to identifiable structural cardiac abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Sinus tachycardia is more frequent than serious atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, while palpitations secondary to premature atrial or, more often, ventricular extrasystoles are common. Bradyarrhythmia and syncope due to new-onset unexplained heart block may also occur both in infectious (eg, Lyme disease) and in immune-mediated forms of myocarditis (eg, sarcoidosis, giant cell myocarditis).

Routine laboratory studies of blood and urine are often normal or reveal only nonspecific abnormalities. Measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal-proBNP (NT-proBNP) is recommended if heart failure is suspected but the diagnosis is uncertain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrocardiogram in patients with myocarditis may be normal or show nonspecific abnormalities. Findings may include nonspecific ST changes, single atrial or ventricular ectopic beats, complex ventricular arrhythmias (couplets or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia), or, rarely, atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. High grade heart block is uncommon in lymphocytic myocarditis, but common in Lyme disease, cardiac sarcoidosis, and idiopathic giant cell myocarditis.

Like acute MI, myocarditis may be associated with regional ST elevations and Q waves. Myocarditis should be suspected in young patients who present with a possible myocardial infarction but have a normal coronary angiogram. In one study of 45 such patients, 35 (78 percent) had a diffuse or focal myocarditis on myocardial imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The findings suggest that combined application of CMR and EMB may provide diagnostic synergy and overcome some of the individual limitations of CMR and EMB. However, the specificity of this approach is uncertain. </p><p>CMR studies have suggested that myocarditis often begins as a focal process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/2,14,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14,50</a>].

A definitive diagnosis of myocarditis is based upon endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), including histology (Dallas criteria) as well as immunohistochemical stains and detection of viral genomes by molecular techniques, mainly polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This approach is supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and definition of cardiomyopathies as well as later expert scientific statements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/1,3,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,56,57</a>], though many patients with suspected myocarditis are not considered candidates for EMB. Analysis of the EMB is also helpful in identifying the etiopathogenetic form of myocarditis, eg, giant cell myocarditis, sarcoidosis, and other autoimmune forms as well as infectious causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/3,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,56,57</a>]. </p><p>In patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, the decision of whether to proceed with EMB should be based upon the likelihood that EMB will significantly impact patient management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Echocardiography is helpful for distinguishing many of these disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Myocarditis may present similarly to ischemic heart disease with chest pain, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and elevated cardiac biomarkers. Wall motion abnormalities seen in myocarditis range from regional wall motion abnormalities (which may be in noncoronary or coronary distributions) to global abnormalities. Exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities may be identified in patients with ischemic heart disease or myocarditis. In patients with myocarditis, these wall motion abnormalities have been attributed to microvascular dysfunction. Coronary angiography is indicated in selected patients with clinical findings suggestive of coronary disease. Coronary spasm, occasionally severe, may accompany myocarditis and cause angina. (See <a href=\"#H861324\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac catheterization'</a> above.)</p><p>Myocarditis may also mimic arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Patients with either condition may present with left bundle branch block morphology ventricular tachycardia and right ventricular echocardiographic and CMR abnormalities including late gadolinium enhancement. Since some patients with myocarditis fulfill clinical criteria for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, a high index of suspicion is required. EMB is helpful in distinguishing these two disorders. </p><p>Other laboratory testing such as serum protein electrophoresis, fat aspirate and CMR for amyloidosis, and ferritin levels and CMR for myocardial iron overload are helpful in excluding other causes of ventricular dysfunction.

EMB is recommended for patients with fulminant heart failure (new onset heart failure of less than two weeks duration associated with hemodynamic compromise) <strong>or</strong> new onset heart failure of two weeks to three months duration associated with a dilated left ventricle and new ventricular arrhythmias, second or third degree AV block, or failure to respond to usual care within one to two weeks. EMB was suggested in selected cases in patients with advanced atrioventricular (AV) block, ventricular arrhythmias, or refractory heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy associated with eosinophilia. EMB may also be considered in several other scenarios when other evaluation is inconclusive and a diagnosis of myocarditis may impact treatment or prognosis.
