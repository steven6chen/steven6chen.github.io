In general, these patients are treated with either primary surgery or definitive radiation therapy (RT). Patients with carcinoma in situ usually are managed surgically in the same way as those with T1 disease. </p><p>Five-year overall survival in patients with stage I or stage II disease is typically from 70 to 90 percent. Careful observation and follow-up after initial treatment are required both to detect a potentially curable recurrence and to identify and treat second primary tumors. Particularly in patients with tobacco- and alcohol-related head and neck cancers, there is a substantial increase in the risk of a second head and neck cancer, as well as of a second primary arising in the lung. Smoking cessation should be pursued in smokers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second primary malignancies in patients with head and neck cancers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>RT and surgery result in similar rates of local control and survival for many sites; the choice of therapy is typically based upon the specific site and its requirements, surgical accessibility of the tumor, and the functional outcomes and morbidity associated with each modality. Oral cavity cancers are a notable exception and are usually best treated with surgery, based upon generally better cure rates and toxicity profile compared with radiation-based therapy. External beam RT or brachytherapy may be options, especially if surgical expertise is not available.</p><p>Traditional surgical approaches through skin incisions to gain access to the mucosal primary (ie, wide local excision) are usually used for salivary and thyroid cancers, which are easily accessible. At other sites, minimally invasive techniques, such as transoral laser microsurgery (TOLM) for larynx and hypopharynx cancers and transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for oropharynx cancers, have improved transoral access. These approaches can improve functional outcomes and decrease morbidity compared with standard surgical approaches. Most early stage oral cavity cancers can be treated through a transoral approach. </p><p>Definitive RT approaches include external beam RT and brachytherapy. Curative RT treatment requires a three-dimensional conformal technique at a minimum. Highly conformal radiation techniques, such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) and image-guided RT (IGRT), have demonstrated reduced morbidity and represent the current standard of care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer#H163948839\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Three-dimensional conformal RT'</a>.)</p><p>For patients initially treated with surgery for clinically early stage cancers, postoperative RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy is indicated for those that are pathologically locoregionally advanced, and have close or positive margins and other factors that increase the risk of local recurrence, including perineural invasion and lymphovascular invasion. The finding of multiple lymph nodes on elective lymph node dissection in the clinically N0 patient is likewise an indication for radiation.

These combined modality approaches include primary surgery followed by either postoperative RT or concurrent chemoradiotherapy, induction chemotherapy (the addition of chemotherapy prior to surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RT), concurrent chemoradiotherapy without surgery, and sequential therapy (induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy) without surgery.</p><p>Decisions about the optimal sequencing and selection of surgery, RT, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy require multidisciplinary input. Key factors to consider include the primary tumor site and disease extent, individual patient factors (age, comorbidity, preferences regarding treatment type), and the likely functional consequences and morbidity of each treatment approach.

For patients with complete regression, as documented clinically and by structural (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and functional (positron emission tomography [PET]) imaging, observation is generally indicated, whereas salvage surgery is indicated in the absence of an adequate response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97278\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97278 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Patients should be educated about possible signs and symptoms of a second primary cancer and local regional recurrence, including hoarseness, pain, dysphagia, bleeding, and enlarged lymph nodes.

Our approach is to conduct a clinical evaluation around six weeks following RT or chemoradiotherapy and then a complete evaluation, including imaging (CT or MRI and generally a <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT)</span> at 12 weeks to document regression of the primary tumor. Imaging should not be performed too soon. Obtaining imaging studies, particularly <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT,</span> prior to 12 weeks following treatment can lead to an increased frequency of false positive results. CT or MRI can be carried out at four to six weeks if needed as part of the clinical evaluation.

Approximately 80 to 90 percent of all recurrences occur within this timeframe; the risk of a second primary malignancy is higher than recurrence risk for most patients beyond three years. </p><p>However, continued follow-up is generally suggested since the morbidity of treatment can worsen over time, and the risk of recurrence and second primary malignancy remains elevated beyond the first five years, especially for cancers of the hypopharynx, larynx, nasopharynx, and salivary glands. Because of the higher risk of recurrence and second primary malignancy in those who continue tobacco use, many schedule more frequent surveillance visits for these patients and continue for longer duration (ie, beyond five years).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256481793\"><span class=\"h2\">Locally recurrent disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most patients with recurrent disease have a poor prognosis, those with only locoregional disease may benefit from definitive treatment. </p><p>All patients with locoregionally recurrent disease should be evaluated for distant metastases prior to initiating retreatment.

HPV associated cancers have increased dramatically and have substantially altered the epidemiology of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. These tumors define a distinct subset of patients who have frequent lymph node involvement and an improved prognosis compared with HPV negative, tobacco-driven oropharynx cancers. </p><p>A revised <span class=\"nowrap\">classification/staging</span> system has been proposed for HPV related oropharyngeal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].<strong> </strong>This<strong> </strong>new system recategorizes many of the patients previously staged as 4a to 1, 2, or 3 with much better prognostic accuracy; the therapeutic approach for patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer has not changed. Because of the better prognosis for patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer, clinical trials that include de-intensification of treatment are underway to define the optimal approach for these patients, with the goal of maximizing long-term cure rates while minimizing toxicity. Currently, however, the approach to these patients outside of a clinical trial setting is the same as for patients with oropharyngeal cancer not associated with HPV.

These are often HPV positive, suggesting an occult oropharynx primary. Clinical, imaging, and surgical staging are required to seek a primary. </p><p>In addition to operative inspection of the mucosal tissue of the upper aerodigestive tract, many centers advocate tonsillectomy in order to locate the microscopic primary site. Functional tongue-base resection is investigational. If no primary site is found, these are treated with curative intent using RT to the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal mucosa, and the neck. In contrast, squamous cell carcinomas involving the lower neck may represent distant metastases from a head and neck, esophagus, lung, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tract primary, so treatment is directed to the neck only and individualized. Patients without other obvious sites of metastatic disease (eg, lung, liver, or bone) should be treated with definitive therapy for locoregional disease.
