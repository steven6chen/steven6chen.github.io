In children, common causes of hip pathology include developmental dysplasia of the hip, transient synovitis, septic arthritis, Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes disease, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Less-common hip disorders include proximal femoral focal deficiency, developmental coxa vara, neuromuscular hip dysplasia, injuries about the hip, arthritides, and tumors. The radiologic evaluation of common and less-common hip disorders is discussed below.</p><p>Accurate diagnosis and treatment of pediatric hip disorders are important because of the potential complications, which may lead to degenerative joint disease in adult life. The history and physical examination, which are necessary to develop a differential diagnosis prior to the selection of imaging tests, and a general review of the imaging tests that are used in the evaluation of bone and joint pain, including the physical principles underlying their usefulness, are presented separately.

Because the appearance of a child's hips varies with age, strong consideration should be given to ordering anteroposterior (AP) and frog leg lateral views of the pelvis rather than views of a single hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This allows easy comparison with a &quot;control&quot; hip in children with unilateral problems.

However, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and bone tumors may occur at any age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and proximal femoral focal deficiency (PFFD) are the most common pathologic disorders affecting infants. Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis also may occur in infants but are more common in toddlers and young children. They are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Septic arthritis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Osteomyelitis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Developmental dysplasia of the hip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DDH is a relatively common condition that is more prevalent in girls, following breech deliveries or oligohydramnios, in Caucasians, and in the presence of a positive family history. DDH is defined as abnormal position of the femoral head relative to the acetabulum, which results in abnormal growth of both components of the hip. Most cases are detected in the first year of life, but DDH may present later, particularly in children with bilateral disease and no asymmetry on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Static and dynamic ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis in neonates and infants up to the age of four months. Plain film radiography is recommended for older infants beginning at age four months and children. Computed tomography (CT) scanning may be used for preoperative planning, conventional contrast arthrography for intraoperative evaluation, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for postoperative follow-up. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Treatment and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasonography</strong> &ndash; Ultrasonography (US) is used in the evaluation of the femoral head, which is not ossified and not visible on plain radiographs in the first four months of life. US is the technique of choice for evaluating high-risk infants, patients with equivocal clinical findings, and for monitoring treatment. Due to normal instability of the hip in the first days of life, US should be performed in patients two weeks or older with clinical suspicion of DDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In high-risk patients with negative clinical examination, a screening US should be performed at six weeks of age, as hip laxity and mild acetabular dysplasia may resolve spontaneously by four to six weeks of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3956277790\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Normal examination and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">US is able to directly visualize the cartilaginous components of the hip, determine the position and coverage of the femoral head, determine the depth and morphology of the acetabulum, and evaluate dynamic instability. The main finding is superolateral displacement of the femur from the acetabulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Diagnosis of DDH on US is made by measuring the alpha angle, formed by the acetabular roof and the vertical cortex of the ilium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56328\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56328 \">image 1</a>). The degree of instability can range from mild laxity to subluxation and dislocation of the hip. When instability is present, US determines the reducibility of the femoral head, which is important for management. US also demonstrates the cause of obstruction to hip reduction, such as inverted labrum and soft tissue in the acetabulum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">US is important in follow-up of patients treated with a Pavlik harness, to demonstrate improvement in the position of the femoral head and the acetabular angle, usually seen after three weeks of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Treatment and outcome&quot;, section on 'Pavlik harness'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plain film radiography</strong> &ndash; Plain film radiography is indicated for diagnosis of DDH in patients four months or older (when the ossified femoral head can be visualized) and in follow-up of infants treated for DDH in this age group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79994\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79994 \">image 2</a>). Plain film radiography of DDH is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Plain radiographs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The characteristic diagnostic features include superolateral displacement of the femur from the acetabulum, a shallow acetabulum, and delayed ossification of the femoral head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other findings are asymmetry of the femoral head ossification center and of acetabular development in unilateral cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MRI</strong> &ndash; MRI is most useful in the preoperative assessment of complicated DDH and in the evaluation of postsurgical reduction and long-term sequelae of partially treated or untreated DDH. Contrast-enhanced MRI shows the position and shape of the cartilaginous femoral head and obstacles to reduction, as well as changes of the acetabulum not demonstrated by US or radiography. MRI also gives information about the acetabular labrum, which is important in the preoperative planning. MRI assesses the vascularity of the cartilaginous femoral head and can detect ischemia. Global decrease in perfusion of the femoral head is associated with significantly increased likelihood of avascular necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If ossification of the femoral head does not occur by one year of age, avascular necrosis is believed to be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. MRI has close to 100 percent sensitivity and specificity for postoperative evaluation of hip reduction and is preferred over CT because of radiation concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CT</strong> &ndash; CT is valuable in the preoperative assessment of DDH. Pediatric protocols that involve reduced doses of radiation should be used. Three-dimensional CT images are particularly useful in the preoperative planning of complex cases and improve the ability to match the proper osteotomy with the specific acetabular deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CT is also useful in the postoperative evaluation of DDH when MRI is contraindicated or not available. Postreduction CT offers precise information regarding the position and coverage of the femoral head within the acetabulum in the cast and confirms successful reduction. Postreduction CT also has predictive value for development of avascular necrosis by measuring the abduction angle of the hip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conventional arthrography</strong> &ndash; Conventional arthrography is used as a guide intraoperatively to confirm the position of the femoral head and to visualize structures which may block the reduction of the hip.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H474001009\"><span class=\"h3\">Proximal femoral focal deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PFFD is an uncommon congenital condition manifested by hypoplasia of part or all of the proximal femur. PFFD encompasses a spectrum from hypoplasia of the femoral head to congenital absence of all but the distal femoral epiphysis. PFFD is unilateral in 90 percent of cases. PFFD presents in infancy with limb shortening that can mimic the Galeazzi sign of unilateral DDH.</p><p>Plain film radiography demonstrates a short femur with dysmorphic or absent head and neck. There is delayed appearance or nonappearance of the femoral capital ossification center. MRI enables early identification of an incompletely ossified femoral head and whether the intervening segment of femur is absent. MRI shows the cartilage structure of acetabulum and upper femur, therefore assisting in prognosis and treatment planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. MRI is the most accurate modality for determination of the type and prognosis of PFFD, including prediction of leg length discrepancy at maturity, hip joint integrity, and stability of the deficient femoral segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Toddlers and children up to 10 years of age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of hip pain in toddlers and children younger than 10 years of age include transient synovitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, developmental coxa vara, and Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes (LCP) disease.

US may aid both in detection of an effusion and guiding needle aspiration. Joint aspiration is the reference standard in differentiating toxic synovitis from septic arthritis. Arthrocentesis is required for definitive diagnosis. It is also required for joint decompression as joint effusion is a risk factor for avascular necrosis. Plain film radiography may detect a large effusion but primarily serves to exclude bone involvement.

MRI and radionuclide bone scan are sensitive for early detection of stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477156375\"><span class=\"h4\">Acetabular labral tear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acetabular labrum is a dense fibrocartilaginous ring which is attached to the margin of the acetabulum, increasing the depth and stability of the joint. The labrum is poorly vascularized, especially the anterior-superior portion, where most labral tears occur. Acetabular labral tears account for up to 20 percent of hip pain presentations in athletic adolescents. Sport activities that involve pivoting or twisting of the hip can result in injury to the labrum. Other causes of labral tears include DDH and femoroacetabular impingement. Labral tears predispose to early osteoarthritis. Direct MR arthrography with intra-articular injection of contrast is the procedure of choice for diagnosing labral tears, as well as any associated articular cartilage thinning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Diagnostic accuracy of MRI for labral tears is 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477156383\"><span class=\"h4\">Femoroacetabular impingement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) results from abnormal contour of the proximal femur and acetabulum, resulting in abnormal contact, which increases with motion. FAI leads to labral cartilage injury, pain, and osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Athletes who perform motions of extreme hip flexion and rotation, such as dancers, are at increased risk for FAI. Other predisposing disorders include DDH, SCFE, and LCP disease. Plain film radiographs are the first imaging modality in the diagnosis of FAI. Two distinct forms of FAI have been described, cam-type and pincer type. Plain film radiographs of the cam-type FAI demonstrate a nonspherical femoral head or lack of femoral head-neck offset. The pincer type of FAI shows signs resulting from acetabular overcoverage. MRI helps diagnose the type of FAI and respective abnormalities of the femoral head, neck, and acetabulum, and shows associated chondral and labral injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477156669\"><span class=\"h3\">Idiopathic chondrolysis of the hip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic chondrolysis of the hip is a disorder characterized by extensive loss of articular cartilage of the proximal femoral epiphysis and acetabulum, with resultant joint space narrowing and restriction of motion. It can be seen in association with SCFE, trauma, infection, arthritis, and immobilization. Girls are affected more than boys, and the symptoms are often unilateral. Patients present with a painful, stiff hip.</p><p>Plain film radiographic abnormalities appear several weeks to months after onset of symptoms. Findings on radiography are joint space narrowing and osteopenia, leading to protrusion acetabuli and premature physeal fusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62259\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62259 \">image 15</a>). MRI is more sensitive for early detection of the disease and shows cartilage loss, geometric abnormal signal in the proximal femoral epiphysis (which may be associated with pin penetration into the joint following repair of SCFE), acetabular bone marrow edema, synovial hypertrophy and enhancement, and minimal joint fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26823812\"><span class=\"h2\">Children of any age</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477156583\"><span class=\"h3\">Juvenile idiopathic arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common cause of chronic arthritis in childhood. JIA (formerly known as juvenile chronic arthritis or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) consists of a clinically heterogeneous group of arthritides that begin before the age of 16 years and persist for more than six weeks. Clinical features and imaging of JIA are discussed separately.

Signs and symptoms are nonspecific, often leading to a delay in diagnosis. In a large retrospective study of tumors and tumor-like lesions of the hip, tumor-like lesions accounted for 43 percent of cases, most commonly simple bone cyst (30 percent of cases), followed by eosinophilic granuloma and aneurysmal bone cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In the same study, benign tumors of the hip accounted for 45 percent of cases, most commonly osteoid osteoma (30 percent of cases), followed by fibrous dysplasia and exostosis.
