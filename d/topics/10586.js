Key components of CMAM programs are provision of a therapeutic food that is of high nutritional quality and has minimal spoilage, known as ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), and regular follow-up at home or in decentralized health centers ideally in proximity to where children live by trained community-based health workers. Using this strategy, more than 90 percent of children with SAM can be treated as outpatients, provided that the child has a good appetite and no obvious acute infection or other medical complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Children with anorexia or complications are initially treated in inpatient programs, but are transferred to outpatient care as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Over the past two decades, an increasing number of countries and relief agencies have adopted CMAM with remarkable success, leading to widespread acceptance and dissemination of this approach worldwide. Where CMAM is available, nutritional recovery rates can be expected to regularly exceed 80 percent, and case fatality rates can be expected in the 5 to 10 percent range, or even better in particularly well-functioning programs. Effective CMAM requires the presence of trained staff, reliable supply chains for RUTF and medications, and the possibility of referral for inpatient care if needed. Because of the increasing availability of RUTF, CMAM has mostly replaced the historical system of universal inpatient management, which was plagued by limited access, poor outcomes, and high costs. There certainly remains an important role for hospitalization for children with complicated SAM. However, CMAM allows most acutely malnourished children to &quot;skip&quot; the inpatient phase of treatment and allows for an orderly transition of care once children with complicated SAM have recovered sufficiently. &#160;</p><p>Treatment of children with <strong>uncomplicated</strong> SAM using CMAM is described in this topic review. Treatment of <strong>complicated</strong> SAM and the evaluation of a child with malnutrition are discussed separately.

Although suboptimal, it is sometimes necessary to treat these young infants as outpatients, due to resource and logistical limitations (on both the part of the health system and families).

Community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) is safe and effective for most of these children, increases access to care by avoiding travel and reducing costs, decreases the risk of nosocomial infection, and decreases the likelihood that the caretaker will take the child home (or even abandon the child) against medical advice before therapy is complete. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2805715412\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMAM emphasizes a decentralized and low-cost model of care that is able to reach far more malnourished children and is able to achieve better outcomes than most inpatient care settings.

RUTF is of high nutritional quality, easily transportable, does not require cooking or other preparation, and has minimal spoilage. It provides all of the micronutrients and macronutrients needed for nutritional rehabilitation. RUTF is available commercially from a number of manufacturers and international agencies such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), or often can be produced locally. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3437079758\"><span class=\"h3\">Formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly available RUTF consists of a mixture of peanuts, sugar, oil, and powdered milk, supplemented with a vitamin and mineral mixture. It is a soft solid paste that is readily consumed by most children six months and older. This formulation was initially developed during the 1990s and has become the de facto standard of care, although no specific formulation of RUTF is universally endorsed as long as all nutritional and safety standards are met. The most widely available commercial source of RUTF is marketed under the name Plumpy'Nut (manufactured by Nutriset, Malaunay, France), but is also increasingly produced locally in over a dozen countries. </p><p>One of the major advantages of the peanut-based formulation of RUTF is that the energy density is fourfold higher than that of F-100 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82277\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82277 \">table 2</a>), allowing malnourished children to eat smaller quantities of food at more frequent intervals, on demand. Because of low water content, RUTF can be kept unrefrigerated for up to two years and is thus ideal for outpatient use. It provides all of the macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals needed for nutritional rehabilitation, including sufficient iron, phosphorus, zinc, and vitamin A to treat these common deficiencies. Additional vitamin supplements are needed only rarely, under select circumstances, such as symptomatic vitamin A deficiency or beriberi. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries&quot;, section on 'Vitamin and mineral supplementation'</a>.) </p><p>RUTF can also be prepared from locally available foods with the addition of powdered milk and a commercially available vitamin and mineral mixture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A number of newer formulations substitute locally available sources of protein (eg, sesame paste) and grain (rice, maize, sorghum, or barley) in an effort to improve palatability and lower the cost of RUTF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]; although none have been used on a wide scale yet, this is likely to be a significant area for growth and further development in the upcoming years.</p><p>Other modifications of the standard peanut-based RUTF recipe have been attempted with varying degrees of success. In a randomized trial, addition of probiotic bacteria and prebiotic fiber to RUTF did not alter the frequency or speed of nutritional cure, frequency of diarrhea or other clinical symptoms, or cumulative mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A pilot trial of including mesalazine as part of CMAM care demonstrated some benefit in decreasing intestinal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], but the benefit of this approach in improving nutritional recovery or decreasing mortality was not established by this small pilot study. Improvements in the fatty acid profile of RUTF to include higher levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been proposed, especially since this may contribute to improved cognitive development in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].</p><p>A promising formulation of RUTF, known as BP-100 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], is wheat-based (rather than peanut) and comes in the form of a <span class=\"nowrap\">biscuit/bar</span> that is especially well-suited to older patients if they do not like the taste or texture of standard peanut-based RUTF. This biscuit can also be crumbled into water to make a porridge. A paste formulation of BP-100 is also available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Both formulations of BP-100 meet World Health Organization (WHO) standards for RUTF, and while clinical efficacy studies in malnourished children are lacking, there is reason to believe that it should be as effective as peanut-based RUTF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2259779475\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMAM and RUTF have become the de facto standard of care for uncomplicated SAM based primarily on successful outcomes with extensive clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. No large-scale randomized controlled trials have compared this protocol with inpatient hospitalization and traditional milk-based formula feedings for all severely malnourished children. In a small randomized trial in severely malnourished children in Senegal, children treated with RUTF recovered more quickly than children treated with F-100 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A systematic review concluded that RUTF or other specially formulated food increased the recovery rate by 29 percent for children with moderate acute malnutrition compared with standard care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, RUTF was slightly superior to blended food supplements in improving weight gain and other anthropometric measurements, and significantly better in decreasing non-recovery rates (relative risk [RR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.40-0.69). Other studies have shown RUTF to be superior to standard corn-soy blends for the recovery from severe acute malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Given the widespread acceptance of CMAM and markedly better outcomes compared with historical recovery rates for traditional inpatient management, it is unlikely that further randomized trials will be performed, both for practical and ethical reasons. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3595028780\"><span class=\"h2\">Feeding protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who are treated as outpatients are prescribed RUTF at a dose of approximately 175 kcal (733 <span class=\"nowrap\">J)/kg/day</span>. RUTF is generally provided in foil sachets containing 500 kcal of RUTF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114599\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114599 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82277\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82277 \">table 2</a>). RUTF should only be provided for the severely malnourished patient and not for others in the family; exceptions should be made for twins in which only one is malnourished, or for other children in the household with very similar ages, since sharing can be assumed. </p><p>There may be situations in the field where severely malnourished infants under six months of age cannot be hospitalized, although every effort should be made to admit them to the hospital for management (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries#H1001776423\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries&quot;, section on 'Infants zero to six months'</a>). If an infant must be treated at home, very close follow-up is warranted, ideally with clinical assessments and weight checks daily or as frequently as feasible. Nutritional therapy should focus on re-establishing exclusive breastfeeding if possible. If this is not possible, commercial infant formula or diluted F-100 (prepared by diluting F-100 with an additional 30 percent water) may be used, although with the caveats that these can be quite expensive and the use of unclean water in their preparation puts the child at high risk for diarrheal diseases; the need to prepare these milks at least once or twice a day also makes this challenging. In some field settings, RUTF has been used for infants as young as four to five months of age, by softening the paste with a small amount of water and feeding it by spoon, but the safety and efficacy of this approach has not been tested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1954291640\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of counseling and education messages should be provided to the caretaker at the start of therapy and should be re-emphasized at each return visit:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RUTF should be fed in frequent, small feedings throughout the day, as driven by the child's appetite (on-demand feeding).

In a meta-analysis of both trials, the rate of nutritional recovery was higher in children treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin</a> plus standard care (including RUTF) compared with placebo plus standard care (75.8 versus 72.4 percent; risk ratio [RR] 1.03, 95% CI 1.0-1.06) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Nutritional recovery was generally defined as resolution of edema and adequate weight gain (ie, weight-for-height Z-score &ge;-2). The findings regarding mortality benefit were conflicting in the two trials. In the Malawi trial, mortality was lower in the antibiotic-treated group compared with placebo (4.4 versus 7.4 percent; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.82). In the Niger trial, mortality rates were considerably lower than in the Malawi trial, and there was no difference in mortality between treatment groups (0.6 percent in the amoxicillin group and 0.5 percent in the placebo group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The meta-analysis did not include a pooled estimate for the effect on mortality. The difference in the mortality rates in the two trials is likely accounted for by the different settings in which the trials were conducted. The Malawi trial was conducted in a &quot;real-world&quot; community setting without easy access to a hospital, whereas the Niger trial was conducted at health centers with ready access to inpatient care and children who weren't recovering well were quickly admitted to the hospital. Thus, in the Malawi trial, &lt;3 percent of children received inpatient care, whereas one-quarter of those in the Niger trial received inpatient care. Of note, in the Niger trial, children in the amoxicillin group were less likely to be transferred to inpatient care compared with those in the placebo group (26.4 versus 30.7 percent; RR 0.86, 95% CI, 0.76-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The efficacy of empiric antibiotics is also supported by retrospective studies, which found that children who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin</a> as part of outpatient management of SAM were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to achieve nutritional recovery compared with children who did not receive antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3176906666\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up and monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children should return for follow-up every one to two weeks, depending on local practices and balancing the burden that frequent visits places on caretakers and health care providers.

Higher weight-for-height Z-score and MUAC are associated with a lower risk of relapse in moderately malnourished children, but it is unknown if this applies to severely malnourished children as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Empiric antibiotic therapy generally should not be continued after discharge, since it does not appear to decrease the risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>An innovation in early identification of severe wasting among children in high-risk populations is to provide caretakers with MUAC tapes and teach them how to identify when their child (or children in their community) have moderate or severe wasting, known as the &quot;Mothers Understand And Can do it&quot; method. Since the tapes generally are color-coded, measuring MUAC is a straightforward activity that does not require the caretaker to have any numerical or verbal literacy. Initial field experience has already shown that this program is effective in early identification of malnutrition, so that children are identified and brought for care when their malnutrition is less severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. This method can be adapted to post-discharge monitoring by providing MUAC tapes and education to caretakers of children being discharged from a CMAM program. This strategy likely facilitates early detection of relapses and re-enrollment in the treatment program, but its efficacy has not been formally evaluated. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304435641\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMUNITY-BASED PREVENTIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective preventive care requires recognition of children at risk for severe malnutrition and implementation of interventions to arrest progression to the severely malnourished state.

In many cases, acute malnutrition might be preventable by recognizing and treating the acute illness early. By contrast, in resource-rich countries, severe malnutrition is usually caused by an underlying chronic illness. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4152612974\"><span class=\"h3\">Diarrheal illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic or prolonged diarrhea is a common risk factor for the development of severe malnutrition. An isolated acute diarrheal illness (duration &lt;14 days) usually causes only transient slowing of growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, in the setting of pre-existing and concomitant undernutrition, the intestinal mucosa does not efficiently regenerate. Repeated environmental and infectious insults contribute to the development of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), which further stunts child growth, leads to cognitive stunting, and places children at elevated risk for developing acute malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Children with persistent diarrhea or repeated bouts of diarrhea are at particularly high risk for severe malnutrition due to malabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Thus, the prevention and treatment of diarrheal illnesses through standard sanitary measures becomes an essential foundation for local efforts to prevent malnutrition.

The immunologic compromise caused by HIV infection accelerates comorbid infections (such as tuberculosis, malaria, or chronic diarrhea) that increase metabolic demands, which increases the risk for malnutrition. In patients with HIV infection, prompt treatment with appropriate antiretroviral drugs and treatment or prevention of opportunistic infections are essential steps to prevent or treat malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Although helpful as a first-line strategy during a crisis, GFD schemes usually fail to prevent significant amounts of severe acute malnutrition because they do not target the highest risk groups within a population who would benefit most from nutrition support. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1707912451\"><span class=\"h3\">Targeted supplementation strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the poor efficacy of GFD schemes, the World Health Organization (WHO) now endorses supplementation strategies that target at-risk subgroups as the best strategy for preventing malnutrition within a population experiencing food insecurity. </p><p>Targeted supplemental feeding programs directly supplement those populations and age groups at the greatest risk for malnutrition, usually nursing mothers and children younger than 60 months. More current recommendations emphasize protein and lipid rich food items, such as ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/6,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,45</a>], in contrast with previous strategies that relied on grain-based foods. RUTF is readily transportable and sanitary, with a long shelf life without refrigeration, allowing for prepositioning of stocks in areas vulnerable to acute food crises. Multiple studies have established the efficacy of RUTF as a therapeutic strategy for children with moderate to severe malnutrition, as outlined above (see <a href=\"#H3194860690\" class=\"local\">'Ready-to-use therapeutic food'</a> above). Additional interest has been focused on whether use of RUTF in children who are already exhibiting stunting may prevent progression to more severe forms of malnutrition. Unfortunately, no cost-effective implementation strategy using RUTF or other lipid-nutrient spreads has been found to decrease the risk of developing severe malnutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2906863729\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Malnutrition is considered <strong>uncomplicated</strong> if the child has no acute infections or other medical complications and has a good appetite, determined by an &quot;appetite test&quot; during the initial evaluation.

The most common RUTF is a peanut-based paste that is readily taken by most children &gt;6 months of age.
