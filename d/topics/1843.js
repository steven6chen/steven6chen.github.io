Discontinuing smoking is an important goal for patients, and each year approximately two out of every three smokers in the United States make an attempt to quit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One-half of people who have ever smoked have been able to quit.</p><p>The behavioral approach to smoking cessation will be discussed in this topic. An overview of smoking cessation and pharmacologic therapies for smoking cessation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83024784\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESS READINESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of willingness to quit smoking for every patient at every clinic visit offers an opportunity to encourage smoking cessation. One way to do this is using a model called the &quot;5 A's&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74402 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The <strong>5 A&rsquo;s </strong>model encourages clinicians to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ask</strong> patients about smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advise</strong> all smokers to quit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assess</strong> their readiness to quit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assist</strong> them with their smoking cessation effort (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52690 \">table 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arrange</strong> for follow-up visits or contact</p><p/><p>The 5 A&rsquo;s model is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another approach to encourage smoking cessation is to proactively offer treatment during the visit, as clinicians do routinely for other chronic conditions such as hypertension. This method is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Brief counseling for smoking cessation has demonstrated efficacy. In a study at several primary care practices, one in five smokers attending a routine primary care appointment was willing to make a serious quit attempt with the help of treatment that incorporated evidence-based counseling and some form of pharmacologic aide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, there are numerous missed opportunities for counseling during office visits, as indicated by National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data that showed that the vast majority of smokers did not receive clinician counseling to quit during an office visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83024826\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS READY TO QUIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A combination of behavioral approaches and pharmacotherapy is most helpful to patients trying to quit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. While behavioral approaches can be used to help cope with nicotine withdrawal symptoms, most smokers will also benefit from the use of pharmacotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3541294929\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All smokers who are ready to quit should be encouraged to participate in behavioral counseling programs. Many different behavioral counseling formats are available, including face-to-face modalities (eg, individual patient-clinician encounters and group therapy) as well as other delivery formats, including telephone contact, text messaging, interactive web-based interventions, phone apps, and website information resources. These other formats can be either standalone tools for patients who are unable to participate in face-to-face counseling or adjuncts to in-person counseling. The different formats generally have in common certain techniques and components of educational content. (See <a href=\"#H1202055576\" class=\"local\">'Content of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Of most importance is selecting behavioral therapy modalities that will be most engaging and acceptable to the patient, taking into account patient preference, medical history, beliefs, and availability. Patients may benefit from using more than one modality, such as group therapy and text messaging. Those who choose not to access therapy can benefit from self-help information resources.</p><p>Formats for behavioral counseling have been evaluated in numerous studies, and many methods of behavioral counseling and support used alone or in combination have been found to be effective. Both individual and group therapy are effective in achieving smoking cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Availability and robustness of studies showing efficacy vary considerably among the different modalities.</p><p>In the United States, many insurance plans cover tobacco-cessation interventions, including behavioral counseling and medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1784768180\"><span class=\"h3\">Brief intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many patients, face-to-face behavioral therapy will consist of only brief clinician counseling in the office. Busy clinicians of any specialty can effectively provide brief advice interventions that increase overall tobacco abstinence rates. This brief counseling should be offered to all smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults#H84078137\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;, section on 'Advise smoking cessation'</a>.)</p><p>The main components of counseling to include are education about withdrawal symptoms, identification of triggers for smoking and coping skills to address those triggers, and stress management techniques. These are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H1202055576\" class=\"local\">'Content of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2329018422\"><span class=\"h3\">Individual counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients may engage in formal individual counseling with a mental health counselor for a period of time to support them through smoking cessation. In-person counseling may consist of multiple visits (often weekly) that start before the quit date. A follow-up visit should be scheduled within a week after the quit date. Visits should continue for one to at least three months after quitting to support a smoker through the quitting process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults#H84078559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;, section on 'Arrange follow-up'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies#H432862147\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;, section on 'Cognitive and behavioral therapies'</a>.)</p><p>A systematic review found that individual counseling compared with minimal support improved quit rates by 40 to 60 percent, with a small additional benefit associated with having more sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nevertheless, formal individual counseling is infrequently used, possibly because of the intensity of involvement required and the increasing availability of other resources.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325868282\"><span class=\"h3\">Group counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Group therapy allows patients to learn behavioral techniques while mutually supporting others attempting to quit. Group programs typically include informational presentations about the quitting process, group interactions, exercises on identification of triggers to smoke and coping strategies to address those triggers, a tapering method leading to a &quot;quit day,&quot; development of coping skills, and suggestions for relapse prevention (see <a href=\"#H1202055576\" class=\"local\">'Content of therapy'</a> below). Only a minority of smokers are willing to attend such programs, citing the inconvenience, even though group counseling is offered by a number of commercial and voluntary health programs and by some employers and public health resources. The cost to smokers can vary from free to several hundred dollars.</p><p>Studies have found group counseling is effective. One-year quit rates after smoking cessation group counseling programs were approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. A systematic review found that group therapy was nearly twice as effective as self-help programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1053124289\"><span class=\"h3\">Telephone counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Telephone counseling can be used as the primary behavioral therapy approach or incorporated into a team-based approach to smoking cessation.</p><p>Proactive telephone counseling has been shown to be more effective than reactive telephone counseling. In the proactive approach, a counselor initiates a call to a smoker on a prearranged schedule; in reactive counseling, a smoker initiates the call to a counselor. Most quitlines offer proactive calls several times during the quitting process, and many quitlines offer smoker-initiated reactive counseling also. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Smokers can access free proactive telephone counseling throughout the United States at a toll-free number (1-800-QUIT-NOW). Some states in the United States have developed fax-referral programs to link clinician offices to their state telephone quitline. In some states, the quitline distributes free nicotine replacement therapy to eligible quitline callers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Telephone counseling programs are more effective than simple self-help interventions, in which smokers are provided with take-home written or audiovisual material to aid them in quitting on their own [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In a clinical trial, among practices that were randomized to routinely refer smokers to a telephone quitline, patients had higher smoking cessation rates at 3 and 12 months compared with those who received standard general practitioner care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Proactive telephone counseling has been shown to have efficacy in several studies, whereas data about reactive counseling are mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. One meta-analysis found quit rates were higher for those smokers who received multiple proactive counselling calls after the smoker called the quitline (risk ratio [RR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.28-1.49). Three or more proactive calls increased the chances of quitting, and there was some evidence of a dose response. A randomized trial of a proactive, personalized telephone counseling intervention in adolescents also found improved smoking abstinence at six months, particularly among daily smokers (10 versus 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. By contrast, data on reactive telephone counseling provide only limited evidence as to whether there is any improvement in quit rates among smokers receiving reactive counseling compared with non-telephone-based controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3038835130\"><span class=\"h3\">Text messaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mobile phone text messaging consists of personalized smoking cessation support through a series of automated motivational messages. Messages suggest behavioral changes and provide positive feedback, and allow patients to request additional assistance as needed.</p><p>The National Cancer Institute has developed a mobile phone smoking cessation service for adolescents and young adults: <a href=\"http://smokefree.gov/smokefreetxt&amp;token=1rBtgWcO+pIKKKyyeB3WryILugxI7uJUUELIo+ljQoWvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=6920\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">SmokeFreeTXT program</a>.</p><p>Several randomized trials have found that text messaging is effective for short- and long-term abstinence. A 2016 meta-analysis including 12 randomized or quasi-randomized trials found that text-based interventions were associated with an increased six-month abstinence compared with various control programs (RR of 1.67, 95% CI 1.46-1.90); the interventions consisted mostly of text messaging but some also included in-person visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Subsequent randomized trials have also found that text messaging increases abstinence. In one trial, those assigned to text messaging were more likely to demonstrate biochemically confirmed continuous abstinence at six-month follow-up compared with the control group (11 versus 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In another trial, smokers who received 157 text messages over 12 weeks were more likely to report eight weeks of prolonged abstinence (26 versus 15 percent) and a subsequent four-week period of complete cessation (21 versus 14 percent) compared with those who received a text message every two weeks for 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1315214759\"><span class=\"h3\">Web resources and interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking cessation interventions that are delivered in more than one format increase abstinence rates. Thus, supplementing information discussed during interventions with self-help materials can serve both as a reinforcement and a time-saving resource for the clinician.</p><p>Several organizations provide patient resource areas or learning centers where patients can access additional materials. Web-based tools may assist in smoking cessation, most notably if the materials are tailored to the user, interactive, and accessed frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Website resources include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/healthy/stay-away-from-tobacco/great-american-smokeout.html&amp;token=s5BEWanOUCO+nyUV8RBcbzR+qEzWPSgHTU6V9XKZWh9sWEYzsXgoX1AUBrtZWvsLNwWMxqXPvX1gObd8pbwCM2won+MQFFfoAxmmWPANfxQ=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6920\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The Great American Smokeout</a> &ndash; Offers telephone, text, tailored email web-based support and apps to support smoking cessation.

These techniques include learning to identify and avoid smoking triggers and developing tools to deal with situations that may tempt smoking. Other components of CBT include education about self-monitoring, reducing cigarette intake gradually in preparation for quitting (although some smokers choose to quit abruptly), and setting a quit date. Effective therapy includes social support delivered as part of treatment to reinforce a smoker's confidence in his or her ability to quit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>].

This is a brief motivational interviewing technique aiming to increase motivation and future quit attempts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Relevance</strong> &ndash; Use motivational information that is personally relevant to a patient&rsquo;s circumstances, such as their disease status or risk, prior quitting experience, and personal barriers to cessation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risks</strong> &ndash; Ask the patient to identify potential negative consequences associated with tobacco use. Stress the risks most applicable to the patient, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Acute health risks</strong> &ndash; Shortness of breath, harm to pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Long-term risks</strong> &ndash; Heart attacks and stroke, lung, and other cancers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Environmental risks</strong> &ndash; Increased risk of lung cancer in partners, respiratory infections in children of smokers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rewards</strong> &ndash; Encourage the patient to identify potential benefits of quitting smoking and highlight those most relevant to the patient, such as improved health in themselves and their family members, saving money, improved performance in sports, etc.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Roadblocks</strong> &ndash; Invite the patient to identify barriers or impediments to quitting and suggest treatments (problem solving counseling, medication) that could address such barriers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Repetition</strong> &ndash; Repeat the motivational intervention every time an unmotivated patient visits the clinic setting.

Questions a clinician can ask to elicit reasons for smoking or quitting include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What do you <span class=\"nowrap\">like/not</span> like about smoking?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What do you worry will happen if you quit smoking?

A scale can also provide valuable information on how to best direct efforts with the patient. With a 0 to 10 scale, the clinician asks:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not at all important and 10 being very important, how important is it for you to quit smoking?&quot; The patient's response is used for the next questions, eg, if the patient selects '6,' ask:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Why is it a 6 and not a 3?&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Why is it a 6 and not an 8?&quot;</p><p/><p>Alternatively, with a descriptive scale, adjectives are used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Can you tell me how important it is to quit smoking?&quot; The clinician then uses the patient&rsquo;s adjective in the next question:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Why is it 'very important' and not just 'somewhat important'?&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;What would have to happen to make it extremely or really, really important to you?&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15300076\"><span class=\"h3\">Providing information about harms of smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The &ldquo;<strong>elicit-provide-elicit</strong>&rdquo; strategy is an effective way to share information about a patient's health and the harms of smoking. With this collaborative approach, a clinician finds out what a patient wants to know and how a patient interprets the information provided by exploring a patient's concerns, knowledge, and questions about smoking. The strategy assumes that patients will value information that they request and perceive it as relevant.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elicit</strong> a patient's perspective on smoking:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;What do you think is the connection between your smoking and your illness?&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Would you like to know about how smoking affects your illness?&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;What do you know about how smoking affects you?&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Provide</strong> information on what &quot;usually&quot; happens to patients who smoke:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Usually, patients who smoke a pack a day have some difficulty breathing.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elicit </strong>the patient's interpretation of this information:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;What do you think of this information about your smoking?&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Would you like more information about smoking?&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99358760\"><span class=\"h3\">Change talk and commitment to change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician can help the patient by listening for or eliciting &quot;change talk,&quot; which consists of statements by the patient indicating they are contemplating change. The clinician's goal is to move a patient into commitment talk and commitment to quit smoking.</p><p>The different levels of change talk can be categorized as desire, ability, reasons and need (DARN).
