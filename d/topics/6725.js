The guidelines for the treatment of osteoporosis based on bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women do not generally apply to premenopausal women, as the relationship between bone mass and fracture in premenopausal women is not the same as in postmenopausal women. BMD alone should not be used to define osteoporosis in a premenopausal woman but, like fragility fractures, is an indication for further evaluation.</p><p>This topic reviews the evaluation and treatment of premenopausal osteoporosis. The epidemiology and etiology are reviewed separately.

However, healthy, premenopausal women with concerns about bone health or risk factors for osteoporosis may request a bone mineral density (BMD) test and seek expert advice if results are abnormal.</p><p>We agree with the International Society of Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71784\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71784 \">table 1</a>) that suggest BMD screening for premenopausal women under the following circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of a fragility fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Known secondary causes of osteoporosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64403\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64403 \">table 2</a>)</p><p/><p>Although routine BMD screening of pre- or perimenopausal women is not currently recommended, some studies have shown beneficial outcomes when BMD testing is combined with education about bone health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. As an example, in one study of 669 premenopausal women (3.8 percent with fractures), osteoporosis education coupled with BMD testing resulted in positive lifestyle changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Twelve months following the intervention, women were less likely to smoke, use alcohol, or consume caffeinated beverages and those with low BMD were more likely to take calcium and vitamin D supplements compared with women with normal BMD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of low bone mass in premenopausal women may be related to failure to attain expected peak bone mass, previous bone loss, or ongoing bone loss. The goal of the evaluation is to distinguish between these groups since the treatment approach differs.</p><p>The evaluation typically begins with a history, physical examination, and biochemical testing. If this initial evaluation is unrevealing, it is possible that the patient never achieved optimal peak bone mass or that insults to the skeleton occurred in the past and are no longer active; this can best be confirmed by serial bone density or biochemical markers of bone turnover. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premenopausal women who come to medical attention in the setting of a fragility fracture or after learning of low bone mineral density (BMD) (Z-score &le;-2.0) should have an evaluation to identify potential secondary causes. Premenopausal women with a fragility fracture require this evaluation for secondary causes even in the absence of low BMD. A secondary cause of osteoporosis can be found in a substantial proportion of premenopausal women with osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], and identification of a contributing condition often helps to guide management of the affected individual.</p><p>Secondary etiologies are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64403\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64403 \">table 2</a>). Most of these conditions can be excluded with a careful history and physical examination. Laboratory evaluation may help to diagnose secondary causes of osteoporosis, such as renal or liver disease, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, Cushing's syndrome or subclinical hypercortisolism, early menopause, celiac disease and other forms of malabsorption, idiopathic hypercalciuria, or, rarely, connective tissue disorders.</p><p>We suggest that all premenopausal women with low BMD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fragility fracture have the following basic tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53634 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium, phosphate, creatinine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alkaline phosphatase, aminotransferases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>25-hydroxyvitamin D</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>24-hour urine for calcium and creatinine</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have abnormalities on the initial laboratory testing, suspicious findings on history and physical examination, or unexplained osteoporosis and fracture after the initial evaluation require additional laboratory tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53634 \">table 3</a>). As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with anemia, low urinary calcium excretion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low vitamin D levels should be tested for celiac disease.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adrenal-incidentaloma#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adrenal incidentaloma&quot;, section on 'Subclinical Cushing's syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome#H2151630722\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;, section on 'Bone loss'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Some women may have genetically determined low peak bone mass. Other women may have accrued less bone than expected due to insults to the skeleton (eg, medications, poor nutrition, estrogen deficiency) that occurred during adolescence and are no longer present at the time of evaluation. In either case, these women should have stable BMD, even though BMD is low. This is in contrast to women with continued declines in BMD who may have an ongoing secondary cause. Serial BMD measurements, if available, are helpful in making this distinction.</p><p>If there is only a single measurement of BMD, obtaining serum or urinary markers of bone turnover may provide useful information. Specimens must often be collected fasting in the morning hours for proper interpretation. If markers of resorption are elevated above the premenopausal range, ongoing bone resorption is more likely. However, the range of normal is wide in premenopausal women, making interpretation difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Additionally, markers of bone resorption must be interpreted according to the patient's age. Adolescence and young adulthood are characterized by active bone modeling and physiologic increases in markers of bone turnover. Additionally, elevated bone turnover markers are expected after a recent fracture.

In patients with a history of fragility fractures without a known cause, iliac crest bone biopsy may be indicated to identify other sources of bone fragility and to guide therapeutic interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H800114928\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium, vitamin D, and weightbearing exercise are recommended for most women with premenopausal osteoporosis. Pharmacologic therapies that have shown antifracture efficacy in postmenopausal women include bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teriparatide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abaloparatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abaloparatide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>. However, there are very few data available to guide clinicians in the use of these medications in premenopausal women and virtually no data on efficacy or safety of these therapies in premenopausal women without secondary causes of osteoporosis. As a result, treatment with medications is usually reserved for those with fracture(s), active bone loss, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> known ongoing secondary causes of osteoporosis and bone loss.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fractures or accelerated bone loss</strong> &ndash; Women with fractures or accelerated bone loss in the setting of hypogonadism may benefit from estrogen replacement.

However, oral reproductive hormone replacement has been shown to be ineffective in most studies examining bone mass in anorexia nervosa (AN), a more complex condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].

We do not suggest routine screening of premenopausal women for osteoporosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The goals of the evaluation of premenopausal women with low bone mass or fragility fracture are to rule out secondary causes and to determine if there is ongoing bone loss. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many secondary etiologies of low BMD can be determined based upon history and physical examination. In addition, all women with low BMD or fragility fracture should have basic laboratory testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53634 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based on the results of the history, physical examination, and basic laboratory testing, more extensive testing may be indicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53634 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend adequate calcium, vitamin D, and exercise in all premenopausal women with low bone mass (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Most women require elemental calcium (from diet and supplements) of 1000 mg daily and vitamin D, 600 international units daily. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with a secondary cause of low BMD, treatment should be targeted to that cause. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Secondary causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For premenopausal women of childbearing potential taking or initiating glucocorticoids who have amenorrhea, we suggest oral contraceptive or hormone replacement therapy (if not contraindicated) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Bisphosphonates are an option for women with fragility fractures or accelerated bone loss (approximately &ge;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/year,</span> depending on clinical setting) while receiving glucocorticoids (7.5 mg daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> equivalent for 3 to 6 months or longer) who do not need estrogen replacement therapy because they have normal menstrual function. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Teriparatide</a> is an alternative option for such women, as long as epiphyses are fully fused. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis#H2578621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Potential short- and long-term risks, as well as potential effects on the fetus, should be considered as part of the decision to use bisphosphonates or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teriparatide</a> for the treatment of premenopausal osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Bisphosphonates'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with chemotherapy-induced early menopause with low BMD (T-score &lt;-2.5) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fragility fracture, we suggest bisphosphonates (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-early-breast-cancer#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of osteoclast inhibitors in early breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Prevention of treatment-related bone loss'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of evidence of accelerated bone loss, we suggest conservative management without specific medical therapy for premenopausal women with isolated low bone mass (no fragility fractures and no known secondary cause) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). These women should have a repeat bone density measurement in one to two years to ensure stable BMD. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In premenopausal women, idiopathic osteoporosis with repetitive fragility fractures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone loss on serial BMD measurements is rare. Rather than empiric treatment, we prefer referral to metabolic bone specialists for further evaluation.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">2013 ISCD Official Positions - Adult http://www.iscd.org/official-positions/2013-iscd-official-positions-adult/ (Accessed on February 28, 2014).</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Jamal SA, Ridout R, Chase C, et al.
