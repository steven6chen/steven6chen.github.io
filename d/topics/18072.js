It is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease (STD) worldwide. Women are affected more often than men. Trichomoniasis is one of the three major causes of vaginal complaints among reproductive aged women, along with bacterial vaginosis and candida vulvovaginitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and a cause of urethritis in men; however, the infection is often asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H770851\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY AND TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The organism responsible for trichomoniasis is the flagellated protozoan <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>, which principally infects the squamous epithelium in the urogenital tract: vagina, urethra, and paraurethral glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other less common sites include the cervix, bladder, Bartholin glands, and prostate. Humans are the only natural host. </p><p>Trichomoniasis is virtually always sexually transmitted. Although survival on fomites has been reported, fomites have no proven role in transmission. Women can acquire the disease from other women, but men do not usually transmit the infection to other men. </p><p>The incubation period is unknown; however, in vitro studies suggest an incubation period of 4 to 28 days in about 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Coexistence of <em>T. vaginalis</em> and bacterial vaginosis pathogens is common, with coinfection rates of 60 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trichomonal infection does not need to be reported to public health authorities, so prevalence is difficult to determine. Prevalence estimates vary according to the population studied and method used for diagnosis.</p><p>The best estimate of the prevalence of trichomoniasis in reproductive aged women in the United States was provided by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), in which a nationally representative sample of 3754 women aged 14 to 49 years self-collected vaginal swab specimens that were subsequently evaluated for <em>T. vaginalis</em> by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The overall prevalence of <em>T. vaginalis</em> was 3.1 percent, and increased with age. Prevalence was highest in non-Hispanic black women (13.3 percent) and lowest in non-Hispanic white women (1.3 percent). </p><p>The overall prevalence of <em>T. vaginalis</em> was higher (8.7 percent) in a study of women tested by a nucleic acid amplification test in clinical settings, and varied from 5 to 7 percent in family planning, internal <span class=\"nowrap\">medicine/family</span> practice, and obstetric and gynecology offices to 16 percent in prisons and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast to the NHANES, these women were tested because of symptoms or the presence of risk factors for chlamydia or gonorrhea. Lastly, a study in 15 STD clinics participating in the STD Surveillance Network (SSuN) reported the prevalence of <em>T. vaginalis</em> was 26 percent among 17,952 symptomatic women tested, 6.5 percent among 3909 asymptomatic women screened, and 29 percent among 92 HIV-infected women <span class=\"nowrap\">tested/screened</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The age distribution of trichomoniasis infections appears to differ from other sexually transmitted infections. In a PCR study of cervicovaginal samples obtained during gynecologic examinations, the peak rate of detection for <em>T. vaginalis</em> occurred in women ages 47 to 53 years, compared with 14 to 20 years for <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, while rates of chlamydia infection rapidly declined after peak detection, <em>T. vaginalis</em> infections had a bimodal distribution with infection peaks occurring in women ages 21 to 22 years and 48 to 51 years. </p><p><em>T. vaginalis</em> can be identified in 70 percent of the male sexual partners of infected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], although carriage in men is often self-limited (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Sex partners'</a> below). A study using an educational internet program to offer sexually active men free nucleic acid amplification tests for <em>T. vaginalis</em> on self-collected specimens reported an overall prevalence of 3.7 percent among the 1699 men, and the highest prevalence by age group was in men aged 40 to 49 years (5.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91868841\"><span class=\"h2\">Women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women, trichomoniasis ranges from an asymptomatic carrier state to an acute, severe inflammatory disease. As many as 50 percent of infected women are asymptomatic, although many of these women eventually become symptomatic. Asymptomatic carriage can persist for prolonged periods of time (at least three months), thus it is often not possible to ascertain when or from whom the infection was acquired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10714395\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common signs and symptoms of acute infection include a purulent, malodorous, thin discharge associated with burning, pruritus, dysuria, frequency, lower abdominal pain, or dyspareunia. Symptoms may be worse during menstruation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Postcoital bleeding can occur. </p><p>Physical examination often reveals erythema of the vulva and vaginal mucosa. The classically described green-yellow, frothy, malodorous discharge occurs in 10 to 30 percent of symptomatic women. Punctate hemorrhages may be visible on the vagina and cervix (&quot;strawberry cervix&quot; in 2 percent of cases) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F102398\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102398 \">picture 1</a>). &#160;</p><p>In chronic infection, signs and symptoms are milder and may include pruritus and dyspareunia, with scanty vaginal secretion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9535475\"><span class=\"h2\">Men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In men, <em>T. vaginalis</em> infection is asymptomatic in over three-quarters of cases and often transient (spontaneous resolution within 10 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. However, untreated infection can persist for months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Symptoms, when present, are the same as those for urethritis from any cause and consist of a clear or mucopurulent urethral discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysuria. They may also have mild pruritus or burning sensation in the penis after sexual intercourse.

In addition, <em>T. vaginalis</em> has been associated with a range of adverse reproductive health outcomes, including cervical neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], posthysterectomy cuff cellulitis or abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], pelvic inflammatory disease in women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. It may also increase women's susceptibility to HIV infection by up to twofold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].

There is some evidence that treatment of trichomoniasis reduces HIV shedding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/24,25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>T. vaginalis</em> infection during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes including premature rupture of the membranes, preterm delivery, and delivery of a low birth weight infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. In a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between <em>T. vaginalis</em> and perinatal outcomes, the risk of preterm birth was increased by 42 percent among infected women (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.15-1.75; nine studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The risks of premature rupture of membranes and delivery of a small for gestational age infant were similarly increased, but each of these findings was based on only two studies. Whether treatment in pregnancy affects these risks, positively or negatively, is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> below.)</p><p>Infants born to infected mothers may contract infection during delivery.

Treatment of asymptomatic infants is not necessary as spontaneous resolution will occur when estrogen levels wane to normal prepubescent levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Because microscopy is a key step in the evaluation of vaginal discharge, it is often the first step in the diagnostic evaluation for trichomoniasis. Microscopy is convenient and low cost. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) can then be done for women with non-diagnostic (or negative) wet mounts. If NAAT is not available, rapid diagnostic kits or culture are then performed. The choice of test is based on availability. </p><p>As with other types of vaginitis, none of the clinical features of trichomoniasis is sufficiently sensitive or specific to allow a diagnosis based upon signs and symptoms alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68759 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. In one study, if the classic clinical features of trichomoniasis in women were used alone for diagnosis, 88 percent of infected women would not be diagnosed and 29 percent of uninfected women would be falsely diagnosed as infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Women undergoing testing for trichomoniasis are generally tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea infections as well. The diagnostic approach to women with vaginal discharge is reviewed separately.

Other findings that are almost invariably present with <em>T. vaginalis</em> infection, but nondiagnostic, include an elevated vaginal pH (&gt;4.5) and an increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes on saline microscopy.</p><p>Fixation and staining is not useful because <em>T. vaginalis</em> may not have the typical pear-shaped flagellated form; instead, it may resemble polymorphonuclear leukocytes or lose morphologic characteristics during fixation and staining, making the etiologic identification difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58793405\"><span class=\"h3\">Nucleic acid amplification test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NAATs detect RNA by transcription-mediated amplification (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or reverse transcriptase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]), are highly sensitive and specific, and have become the accepted gold standard for the diagnosis of <em>T. vaginalis</em>.

The Aptima <em>T. vaginalis</em> assay has demonstrated superior performance in side-by-side comparisons with other diagnostic methods in all patient populations and specimen types tested (vaginal discharge, urine). Because the prevalence of <em>Trichomonas</em> is equal to or greater than chlamydia and gonorrhea, there is an increasing trend toward screening for all three infections simultaneously with NAAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,44</a>].

Culture offers high sensitivity (up to 95 percent) and specificity (&gt;95 percent). However, this test is not widely available and takes up to seven days to obtain a result. Culture is useful in patients with elevated vaginal pH and increased numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes but an absence of motile trichomonads and clue cells on wet mount, when microscopy is unavailable or yields ambiguous results, or when nucleic acid amplification tests are not available.

The subject was diagnosed with trichomoniasis if any of these tests were positive. In women, vaginal swab APTIMA TV was more sensitive than wet mount or culture (96.6 versus 54.6 and 75.0 percent, respectively).

Liquid-based cervical cytology is not a sensitive test for diagnosis of trichomoniasis, but treatment of women with trichomonads noted on liquid-based cervical cytology is reasonable since specificity is high. In a study that performed both liquid-based cervical cytology and culture for <em>T. vaginalis</em> on 203 consecutive women, 28 had a liquid-based smear positive for trichomonads and 44 had positive cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Although sensitivity of liquid-based smears for <em>Trichomonas</em> infection was low (61 percent), specificity was high (99 percent), resulting in a false positive rate of only 1 percent. </p><p>Conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) smears do not perform as well for diagnosis of trichomoniasis.

This makes the positive predictive value poor in a low prevalence population. Thus, the Pap smear should not be used to diagnose trichomoniasis.

Patients should be instructed to avoid intercourse until they and their partners have completed treatment and are asymptomatic, which generally takes about a week. After single dose therapy or treatment of asymptomatic patients, the couple should abstain from intercourse until <strong>both</strong> partners have waited at least seven days since taking the last antibiotic dose.

Most strains of <em>T. vaginalis</em> are highly susceptible to these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Randomized trials using these drugs have generally reported cure rates of 90 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. Therapy with drugs other than 5-nitroimidazoles is an option, but cure rates are low (&le;50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. </p><p>We recommend treatment with a single 2 gram oral dose of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (ie, four 500 mg tablets) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,61</a>]. We believe cure rates with tinidazole are comparable to those of metronidazole, but the drug is better tolerated. Tinidazole generally causes fewer gastrointestinal side effects but the cost is higher compared with metronidazole. Although tinidazole was significantly more effective than metronidazole in several randomized trials, most of these trials were subject to bias since outcome was assessed by clinicians who were not blinded to the patient's treatment group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]</p><p>An alternative multi-dose regimen is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> 500 mg orally twice a day for seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Although similar cure rates are reported with single- and multiple-dose regimens (cure rate for single dose: 82 to 88 percent; cure rate for multiple dose: 85 to 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/59,61,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,61,64</a>], a meta-analysis of six trials reported a higher treatment failure rate for single-dose compared with multi-dose treatments (pooled risk ratio 1.80,95% CI 1.07-3.03; p &lt;0.03 in HIV-negative women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Thus, women who are able to complete the multi-dose regimen appear to benefit from the longer treatment. In contrast, advantages of single-dose therapy include better compliance, a shorter period of alcohol avoidance, and possibly decreased Candida superinfection (although there is no evidence of decreased Candida superinfection). However, side effects (eg, nausea, vomiting, headache, metallic taste, dizziness) appear to be dose-related and thus occur less frequently with the lower doses used in multiple-dose, prolonged therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Oral is preferred to vaginal therapy since systemic administration achieves higher drug levels and therapeutic drug levels in the urethra and periurethral glands, which serve as endogenous reservoirs of organisms that can cause recurrence. Cure rates for vaginal therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> gel are &le;50 percent, which is significantly lower than with oral therapy, and therefore vaginal therapy with metronidazole is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,61</a>]. </p><p>Patients should be advised to not consume alcohol for 24 hours after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> treatment and for 72 hours after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> treatment because of the possibility of a disulfiram-like (Antabuse effect) reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21057085\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergy to 5-nitroimidazole drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the low efficacy of any drug other than the 5-nitroimidazole drugs (see <a href=\"#H21057167\" class=\"local\">'5-nitroimidazole drugs'</a> above), we suggest patients with an IgE mediated allergy to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> be referred for desensitization rather than using an alternative class of drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Desensitization is very effective: in one series, all 15 women who underwent desensitization subsequently eradicated their infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119293052\"><span class=\"h3\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We retest all women treated for a documented <em>Trichomonas</em> infection, regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated.

This is consistent with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The rationale for repeat testing is that reinfection rates of up to 17 percent have been reported in women treated for trichomoniasis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Sex partners</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of sex partners is indicated because maximal cure rates in infected women are achieved when their sexual partners are treated simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,67</a>]. Concurrent treatment also prevents transmission to other sexual contacts. It is not mandatory to identify the organism in a male partner before treating him (ie, Expedited Partner Therapy [EPT]), given the high rate of concurrent carriage (30 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]), difficulty of diagnosis in males, lower compliance when the partner is asked to visit his health care provider, and the convenience, low morbidity, and low cost of empiric treatment. </p><p>Treatment of sex partners is identical to that for nonpregnant females, with preference for a single dose regimen to maximize compliance (ie, single oral dose of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> 2 grams). Neither partner should resume intercourse until both partners have completed treatment, otherwise reinfection can occur.</p><p>Ideally, if possible, sexual partners should be referred for diagnostic evaluation because concurrent sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, are common and should be diagnosed and treated, if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. However, if the one partner has been diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea, EPT is also an option for these infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnant women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the association of <em>T. vaginalis </em>infection with adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], symptomatic pregnant women with confirmed infection are treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Additionally, asymptomatic trichomoniasis can be diagnosed during pregnancy with routine screening of HIV-infected or high-risk women. Although treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women is not universal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], we believe the benefits of treatment, including reduced partner and perinatal transmission, outweigh potential risks. A historical concern regarding treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women comes from one trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>] and subsequent meta-analysis (based heavily on the trial) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>] which reported an increased risk of preterm birth in women treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> therapy compared with untreated women. However, the trial had multiple limitations, including starting screening in the second trimester, and subsequent studies have not reported adverse outcomes from treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/33,72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,72-74</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p>The recommended medication during pregnancy is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> 2 g given as a single oral dose. Because many pregnant women have significant nausea or vomiting, some clinicians prefer metronidazole 500 mg twice daily orally for five to seven days to lessen medication induced nausea and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Both regimens are acceptable. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clotrimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clotrimazole</a> 1% cream inserted vaginally often results in symptomatic relief, it does not eradicate the organisms. There is limited information on the safety of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> in pregnancy; therefore, we avoid its use, especially in the first trimester. For these reasons, oral metronidazole therapy is preferred. </p><p>While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> crosses the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>], it appears to be low-risk. Cross-sectional and cohort studies have not reported teratogenicity or mutagenic effects in humans, although studies suggest the drug is mutagenic in bacteria and carcinogenic in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/71-73,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73,77</a>]. </p><p>As with non-pregnant women, treatment of sexual partners is indicated when <em>T. vaginalis</em> is confirmed in a pregnant woman.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5937603\"><span class=\"h2\">Breastfeeding women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breastfeeding women can be treated with the single 2 gram dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> is secreted in breast milk, breastfed infants receive metronidazole doses that are lower than those used to treat infections in infants. Nevertheless, some clinicians recommend deferring breast feeding for 12 to 24 hours following maternal single dose treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Alternately, maternal treatment with a seven day regimen (400 mg orally three times a day for seven days) has been reported to produce a lower metronidazole concentration in breast milk and is considered compatible with breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>There are no human data supporting an association between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> exposure from breastfeeding and cancer; however, an association with carcinogenesis in rodents has been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

Of note, all women were given a 2 gram metronidazole dose to deliver to their sex partners. In another trial, HIV-infected women on antiretroviral therapy had 2.6-fold greater risk of persistent trichomoniasis than HIV-infected women not on antiretroviral therapy, but this risk could be minimized by multiday dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Additionally, there is a high prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV-infected/<em>T</span>. vaginalis</em>-infected women, and there is an apparent association between the presence of bacterial vaginosis and early failure of single dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> treatment of trichomoniasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. </p><p>As with all women, the CDC suggests retesting HIV-infected women three months after completion of therapy based on the high proportion of recurrent or persistent <em>T. vaginalis</em> infection in this population and the association between HIV and this infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8164595\"><span class=\"h2\">Men with urethritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of men with urethritis is discussed separately.

It is virtually always sexually transmitted and can be identified in 70 percent of the male sexual partners of infected women. Coinfection with other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and bacterial vaginosis is common. (See <a href=\"#H770851\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology and transmission'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Untreated trichomonal vaginitis may progress to urethritis or cystitis. <em>T. vaginalis</em> has been associated with a range of adverse reproductive health outcomes, including cervical neoplasia, posthysterectomy cuff cellulitis or abscess, atypical pelvic inflammatory disease in women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), infertility, and preterm birth. It may also increase women's susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Consequences'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations in women range from an asymptomatic carrier state to an acute, severe inflammatory disease. Signs and symptoms include a purulent, malodorous, thin discharge with associated burning, pruritus, dysuria, frequency, and dyspareunia. Men are often asymptomatic, but have developed urethritis.

Treatment reduces the prevalence of <em>T. vaginalis</em> carriage in the population, relieves symptoms, and reduces the risk of sequelae (including <span class=\"nowrap\">acquisition/transmission</span> of HIV). For nonpregnant women and their sex partners, we recommend a single oral dose of 2 grams of a 5-nitroimidazole drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a>) compared with multi-dose regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Single dose therapy is more convenient and appears to be as effective as multiple dose therapy. Oral administration is more effective than topical administration. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Nonpregnant women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be screened for other sexually transmitted infections.

However, EPT is reasonable if compliance is an issue. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Sex partners'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend treating symptomatic pregnant women with confirmed <em>T. vaginalis </em>infections (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In addition, we suggest treating asymptomatic pregnant women with confirmed infection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metronidazole</a> 2 g orally in a single dose is used in pregnancy. Alternate dosing with metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for five to seven days may be associated with less nausea and vomiting. Either regimen is acceptable. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For HIV-positive women with <em>T. vaginalis</em>, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> 500 mg twice per day for seven days rather than single-dose therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3045469\" class=\"local\">'HIV-infected women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with refractory trichomoniasis, increasing the dose and duration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> are the primary options. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Refractory cases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be instructed to avoid intercourse until they and their partners have completed treatment and are asymptomatic, which generally takes about a week. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women treated for a documented trichomonal infection are retested within three months following treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated. Testing with NAAT can be done as soon as two weeks after completing treatment.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trichomoniasis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Anderson MR, Klink K, Cohrssen A.
