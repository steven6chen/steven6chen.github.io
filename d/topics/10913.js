This topic review discusses the two types of metaplastic (chronic) atrophic gastritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Other forms of gastritis and gastropathy are presented separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">METAPLASTIC (ATROPHIC) CHRONIC GASTRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term metaplastic (chronic) atrophic gastritis, sometimes referred to as gastric atrophy, is commonly used to describe a form of chronic gastritis that, in addition to inflammation, is associated with mucosal thinning, loss of specialized cells in gastric glands, and changes in epithelial cell types (ie, metaplasia). Metaplastic (chronic) atrophic gastritis includes two main subtypes, autoimmune and environmental metaplastic atrophic gastritis (AMAG and EMAG). This terminology has appeal for two reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metaplasia, especially of the intestinal type, is virtually a universal feature of chronic atrophic gastritis and is often the most dependable defining morphologic feature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metaplasia is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of chronic atrophic gastritis and to its complications (eg, pernicious anemia, gastric ulcer, dysplasia, and gastric cancer).</p><p/><p>Although the AMAG and EMAG may be pathogenetically and clinically distinct, they often share histologic features and may overlap clinically. Two main types of metaplasia are seen in both AMAG and EMAG: pseudopyloric (&quot;pyloric&quot;) metaplasia and intestinal metaplasia (IM). Other types of metaplasia may be seen in chronic atrophic gastritis, including pancreatic (acinar), ciliated cell, and squamous. These latter three types are uncommon and of uncertain clinical significance. The importance of the IM type is that this type is a precursor lesion to dysplasia and gastric cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pseudopyloric metaplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudopyloric metaplasia refers to the replacement of parietal and chief cells in the oxyntic mucosa by mucus-secreting cells of the type normally found in antral (ie, pyloric) mucosa. These mucus-secreting cells arise from mucous neck cells or stem cells surviving in damaged oxyntic glands. The pseudopyloric glands have the coiled architecture seen in normal antrum, but are smaller, less numerous, contain less mucin, and do not have antral-type endocrine cells, especially G cells. Some authors refer to pseudopyloric metaplasia as spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intestinal metaplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IM is defined by the replacement of the surface, foveolar, and glandular epithelium in either the oxyntic or antral mucosa (or both) by intestinal epithelium, which is easily recognized by the presence of goblet cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. IM can be further divided into three subtypes. The different subtypes of IM can be distinguished, in part, by the mucins produced by the goblet cells:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I, or complete IM, is most obvious and shows fully formed small intestinal epithelium, including eosinophilic absorptive enterocytes with a defined brush border, goblet cells, and Paneth cells. The goblet cells contain predominately sialomucins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II, or incomplete IM, resembles colonic epithelium, with no defined brush border, and consists of goblet cells with multiple irregular mucin droplets of varying sizes interspersed among gastric-type mucin cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64199\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64199 \">picture 1</a>). The goblet cells in type II IM (as in type I) contain predominately sialomucins. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III is also incomplete, and the goblet cells resembling colonic epithelium contain predominately sulfomucins rather than sialomucins.</p><p/><p>Type III metaplasia has been linked with gastric cancer of the intestinal type in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] but not others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, the clinical utility of subtyping of intestinal metaplasia is unclear, but advocated by some experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. The risk of gastric cancer appears to be greatest in patients with extensive IM involving the lesser curvature from the cardia to the pylorus or the entire stomach compared with patients with more focal or antral-predominant IM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOIMMUNE METAPLASTIC ATROPHIC GASTRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis (AMAG) is a form of metaplastic (chronic) atrophic gastritis that is associated with a T-cell mediated destruction of the oxyntic mucosa and production of autoantibodies directed against parietal cell antigens and intrinsic factor. In a mouse model of autoimmune gastritis, antibodies were directed against the peptide chains of the hydrogen-potassium ATPase in parietal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is believed that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in the pathogenesis of AMAG. Autoimmune gastritis susceptibility genes (<em>Gasa 1, 2, 3, </em>and<em> 4</em>) have been discovered on chromosomes 4 and 6 and the H2 gene complex in murine models. Some of these genes are located on the same locus as diabetic mouse diabetes mellitus (DM) susceptibility genes, which may account for the strong association between AMAG and DM type 1 in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. On the environmental front, the close association between AMAG and <em>H. pylori</em> infection in many patients has led to speculation that <em>H. pylori</em> may, in some cases, induce AMAG via antigenic mimicry or cross-reactivity. This hypothesis is controversial and the subject of active research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, AMAG has a similar prevalence among white, African American, and Hispanic populations, and occurs over a wide age range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The disease is more common among women. There is an association of AMAG with other autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Up to one-third of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease and 6 to 10 percent of patients with Type 1 DM have concurrent AMAG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Affected patients are at high risk for developing pernicious anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/2,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,14</a>]. Patients with AMAG may be asymptomatic, but many of them have dyspepsia with postprandial distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Asymptomatic relatives of patients with AMAG are sometimes found to have established AMAG and even pernicious anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The chronic inflammation, glandular atrophy, and epithelial metaplasia of AMAG are closely paralleled by elevated serum antibodies to parietal cell antigens and to intrinsic factor, reflecting its autoimmune origin. The immune-mediated loss of parietal cells leads to both profound hypochlorhydria or even achlorhydria and inadequate production of intrinsic factor, which leads to vitamin B12 malabsorption and pernicious anemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;</a>). Serum pepsinogen I levels, produced in the oxyntic mucosa, decrease also, as does gastric pepsinogen secretion.</p><p>Patients with AMAG may present with the following laboratory abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypergastrinemia from uninhibited gastrin secretion as a consequence of parietal cell atrophy and <span class=\"nowrap\">hypochlorhydria/achlorhydria</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased serum pepsinogen I levels due to atrophy of zymogenic chief cells in the oxyntic mucosa. As a result, the ratio of serum pepsinogen I to II may also decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron deficiency anemia can precede the onset of pernicious anemia by several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Gastric acid normally enhances iron solubility and intestinal iron absorption by converting the ferric form of iron into the more absorbable ferrous form. Gastric acid also facilitates peptic denaturing of dietary proteins bound to iron. <span class=\"nowrap\">Hypochlorhydria/achlorhydria</span> and reduced peptic activity in AMAG decreases bioavailable iron, leading to iron malabsorption and deficiency. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pernicious anemia from vitamin B12 malabsorption and deficiency occurs in advanced AMAG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with AMAG and vitamin B12 deficiency often have methylmalonic aciduria and methylmalonic acidemia and may develop neurologic consequences in addition to megaloblastic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There may be laboratory features other autoimmune disorders such as thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/10-12,14,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12,14,16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with AMAG, the metaplasia, glandular atrophy, and inflammation are confined to the gastric body and fundus. In the early stages, referred to as active autoimmune gastritis, the oxyntic mucosa is infiltrated and destroyed by lymphocytes and plasma cells. The uneven destruction of specialized cells (ie, parietal and chief cells) within the oxyntic glands, with preserved islands of relatively normal oxyntic mucosa, leads to pseudopolyposis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p>Histologic features of <span class=\"nowrap\">early/evolving</span> AMAG seen on oxyntic mucosal biopsies include at least two of the following: <span class=\"nowrap\">deep/full-thickness</span> chronic inflammation, oxyntic gland destruction, prominent eosinophils, <span class=\"nowrap\">intestinal/pseudopyloric/pancreatic</span> metaplasia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parietal cell pseudohypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Pseudohypertrophy of remaining parietal cells may be present in islands of surviving mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>]. This observation has led to the suggestion that autoantibodies against the hydrogen-potassium ATPase inhibit acid secretion, causing parietal cell pseudohypertrophy because of enlargement of canaliculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This is analogous to the morphologic effect of proton pump inhibitors (which block the hydrogen-potassium ATPase) on parietal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In end-stage AMAG, metaplastic glands completely or almost completely replace oxyntic glands. In extreme cases, the mucosa becomes villiform, closely resembling normal small intestine. The epithelial cells may also appear megaloblastic in patients who have coexisting untreated pernicious anemia with vitamin B12 deficiency. Nodular or linear enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia may be evident.</p><p>In more advanced or end-stage AMAG, gross examination of the stomach by endoscopy or contrast radiography may demonstrate absent or inconspicuous rugae in the gastric body and fundus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, the submucosal blood vessels may be visible through the thin, atrophic, overlying mucosa. Atrophy and metaplasia are usually absent in the antrum in AMAG.</p><p>The proportions of pseudopyloric metaplasia versus IM within the body and fundus vary widely among patients with AMAG, and either form can predominate. This variability must be taken into account when obtaining and interpreting gastric biopsy specimens. Correct anatomic localization of the biopsy to body or antrum requires that the endoscopist provide accurate information about the biopsy sites. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Where did the biopsy specimens come from?'</a> below.)</p><p>Metaplasia is usually absent or only slight in the antrum in patients with AMAG, but changes consistent with reactive gastropathy are often present for unclear reasons. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Neoplastic lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with AMAG are at increased risk for the development of gastric neuroendocrine tumors and adenocarcinomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastric neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroendocrine tumors arise from transformation of enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL) cells (which are responsible for histamine secretion) within the oxyntic mucosa due to chronic stimulation by gastrin (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical characteristics of well-differentiated neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors arising in the tubular digestive tract, lung, and genitourinary tract&quot;</a>). The hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria associated with AMAG induces hyperplasia of the <span class=\"nowrap\">antral/pyloric</span> G cells (the cell type responsible for producing gastrin) and hypergastrinemia. Gastrin exerts a trophic effect on endocrine cells (eg, ECL cells) within the metaplastic and atrophic body mucosa, which increase in number and may give rise to hyperplastic nodules both within and around the glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p>The relationship between gastrin-induced ECL cell hyperplasia and neuroendocrine tumor formation is supported by the observation that antrectomy, with resultant loss of G cell mass and normalization of plasma gastrin concentrations, can lead to reversal of endocrine hyperplasia and reduced tumor size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Thus, antrectomy, rather than total gastrectomy, can be considered for patients with AMAG-associated neuroendocrine tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Chronic treatment with netazepide (YF-476), an oral drug that blocks the <span class=\"nowrap\">gastrin/CCK2</span> receptor, has shown benefit in patients with these gastric neuroendocrine tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

However, most nodular and polypoid lesions encountered in the gastric body and antrum in patients with AMAG are retained islands of uninvolved mucosa (pseudopolyps) or benign epithelial hyperplastic lesions, making biopsy of visible nodules imperative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastric adenocarcinomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric adenocarcinoma develops in 1 to 3 percent of patients with AMAG via intervening steps of IM and dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/1,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29,30</a>]. The magnitude of the increased relative risk is variable in the literature, with estimates ranging from 3 to 18 times greater than an age-matched population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. Two specific metaplastic cell lineages are considered key neoplastic precursors for the development of adenocarcinoma in these patients: pseudopyloric metaplasia and IM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Studies evaluating the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis and pernicious anemia have shown the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased overall cancer risk was noted in a cohort study that included 4517 men and women in Sweden who had pernicious anemia and were followed for 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The 553 cancers diagnosed was higher than expected in the general population. The risk was highest for cancers of the stomach, esophagus, and pancreas (relative risk [RR] of 2.9, 3.2, and 1.7, respectively). The risk of stomach cancer was highest in the first year after diagnosis of pernicious anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a long-term study that included 80 patients with pernicious anemia, one patient had gastric adenocarcinoma at the outset. Although varying degrees of dysplasia were present in 42 percent of the patients, none progressed to adenocarcinoma during a follow-up of 6 to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia and a carcinoid developed in two other patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another population-based study included 152 patients followed for a mean of approximately 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Although these patients did not undergo regular surveillance endoscopy, only one case of gastric cancer was detected during clinical follow-up, a rate which was like that expected in the general population.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122606258\"><span class=\"h3\">Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association between metaplastic (chronic) atrophic gastritis and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has also been noted. In the above-mentioned Swedish cohort study of patients with pernicious anemia, the relative risk of esophageal cancer (almost entirely squamous cell carcinoma) was 3.2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a meta-analysis that included seven studies of esophageal SCC, the overall relative risk for developing esophageal SCC in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis was 1.94 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In this same study, the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma was also increased (relative risk [RR] 2.9).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">H. pylori</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with AMAG are <strong>less likely</strong> to be infected by <em>H. pylori</em> than age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Two possible explanations are that the metaplastic intestinal epithelium becomes unsuitable (lacks host receptors) for <em>H. pylori</em> colonization, and that the associated hypochlorhydria encourages overgrowth of the stomach by other bacterial species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Despite their inverse relationship, chronic <em>H. pylori</em> gastritis and AMAG share some clinical and pathologic features. Both can be associated with an atrophic form of body gastritis and hypochlorhydria. In addition, some patients with <em>H. pylori</em> infection have circulating parietal cell autoantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Serologic testing for past <em>H. pylori</em> infection may be helpful in such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-diagnostic-tests-for-helicobacter-pylori-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is also evidence that <em>H. pylori</em> might serve as a trigger of AMAG and pernicious anemia. In a study involving 160 patients with AMAG who were identified by the presence of hypergastrinemia and strongly positive antiparietal antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], patients were divided into three groups: those with iron deficiency anemia, usually with microcytic red blood cell indices (52 percent), those with normocytic indices (30 percent), and those with macrocytic anemia (18 percent). Progression from iron deficiency anemia to macrocytic anemia correlated strongly with age. Furthermore, the prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> infection was high among those younger than age 20 years (88 percent) but declined to only 12.5 percent in those older than 60 years. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that <em>H. pylori</em> infection at a younger age triggers the development of autoimmune gastritis, which progresses clinically over time from iron deficiency anemia (perhaps due to iron malabsorption because of <span class=\"nowrap\">hypochlorhydria/achlorhydria)</span> to cobalamin deficiency with macrocytosis. <em>H. pylori</em> infection has also been associated with iron deficiency anemia in patients without evidence of gastrointestinal blood loss or metaplastic atrophic gastritis by mechanisms that are unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-chronic-gastritis-due-to-helicobacter-pylori#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and chronic gastritis due to Helicobacter pylori&quot;, section on 'Iron deficiency anemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267230500\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic testing for both anti-intrinsic factor and antiparietal cell antibodies is recommended as an adjunct to the histologic diagnosis of AMAG.

Antibodies against parietal cells have lower specificity but are approximately 80 percent sensitive. A combination of the two tests, in conjunction with a fasting serum gastrin level (usually elevated in AMAG), can be helpful to support the diagnosis in patients with histologic features of <span class=\"nowrap\">early/evolving</span> AMAG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ENVIRONMENTAL METAPLASTIC ATROPHIC GASTRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental metaplastic atrophic gastritis (EMAG) is due to the effects of environmental factors, such as <em>H. pylori</em> infection and perhaps dietary constituents, on the gastric mucosa. Unlike autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis (AMAG), mucosal changes in patients with EMAG affect both the <span class=\"nowrap\">body/fundus</span> and the antrum in a multifocal distribution, but with heaviest involvement of the antrum. In addition, EMAG differs from AMAG in a number of other ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric acid production is relatively preserved</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fasting serum gastrin levels are not markedly elevated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parietal cell and intrinsic factor autoantibodies and pernicious anemia are usually absent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a higher risk for gastric ulcer disease compared with AMAG, presumably due to the protective effect of the accompanying hypochlorhydria in the latter disorder</p><p/><p>Patients with EMAG are at a 10- to 15-fold increased risk for gastric cancer, particularly the intestinal type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/1,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30</a>]. This much higher cancer risk relative to AMAG is puzzling given the histologic similarities between the two forms of metaplastic gastritis. It is hypothesized that increased macrophage-mediated inflammatory drivers present in EMAG may be responsible for the progression from metaplasia to carcinoma in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal pathologic features in EMAG are multiple, focally distributed areas of atrophy, metaplasia, and inflammation. As a rule, these changes are most heavily concentrated in the antrum, but the location may vary depending upon the stage of the disease. Changes may be more evident along the lesser curvature at the junction of the body and antrum (ie, the transitional zone) in patients with mild or early disease. In severe or advanced disease, metaplastic epithelium can almost completely replace the normal antral mucosa.</p><p>The progression from early to advanced stages of EMAG is often reflected by proximal migration of the transitional zone, which can be demonstrated by endoscopic biopsy and in resection specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Oxyntic mucosa (ie, mucosa of the body and fundus) adjacent to the transitional zone is progressively replaced by intestinal and pseudopyloric metaplastic mucosa. In addition, the intact oxyntic mucosa may be thinned and have a reduced number of parietal cells. These changes need to be considered when trying to make a pathologic distinction between EMAG and AMAG on gastric biopsy specimens. A white villiform pattern may be visible endoscopically, particularly using advanced imaging modalities such as narrow-band imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies have attempted to identify risk factors for EMAG confirmed by biopsy. Instead, in such epidemiologic studies individuals with EMAG are usually identified indirectly by screening with serum pepsinogen concentrations (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-gastritis-and-gastropathy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of gastritis and gastropathy&quot;, section on 'Stomach-specific biochemical markers'</a>). A shortcoming of this approach is that <em>H. pylori</em> infection, which is often common in the populations under study, increases serum pepsinogen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. As a result, the prevalence of EMAG is most likely to have been underestimated using pepsinogen screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, the correlation between a low serum pepsinogen I level and histologic demonstration of EMAG is well-documented, and pepsinogen determination is the best available tool for population studies of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/1,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,48,49</a>].</p><p>EMAG and intestinal-type gastric cancer are closely associated pathologically, clinically, and epidemiologically. Thus, similar contributing factors are proposed for the two conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">H. pylori</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>H. pylori</em> plays a pivotal role in the development of EMAG and gastric adenocarcinoma. Histopathologic studies indicate that chronic <em>H. pylori</em> infection progresses over decades through stages of chronic superficial gastritis, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/1,30,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30,50</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-gastrointestinal-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastrointestinal malignancy&quot;</a>). The mechanisms whereby some patients with <em>H. pylori</em> infection develop IM and carcinoma, while others do not, are multifactorial and likely involve an interplay of bacterial virulence factors and host susceptibility factors.</p><p>Whether eradication of <em>H. pylori</em> can affect the natural history of gastric IM and its associated cancer risk is uncertain. <em>H. pylori</em> eradication before the development of extensive gastric IM may be effective in reducing gastric cancer incidence, but there may be a point of no return during the sequence of <em>H. pylori</em>-induced carcinogenesis, coinciding with the presence of extensive metaplastic (chronic) atrophic gastritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>].

Other possible risk factors include cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and chronic bile reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF ENDOSCOPIC AND BIOPSY DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An accurate diagnosis of autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis (AMAG) and environmental metaplastic atrophic gastritis (EMAG) depends upon good communication between the endoscopists and pathologists. To distinguish between AMAG and EMAG from biopsy findings, at least two questions must be answered:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Where did the biopsy specimens come from?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe metaplastic (chronic) atrophic gastritis can deprive pathologists of the histologic clues needed to identify the origin of the biopsy. Thus, it is essential that biopsy specimens be taken from areas that endoscopists believe are unequivocally within the body, fundus, or antrum, and indicate their origin clearly and place them in separate containers. As noted above, AMAG is confined to the gastric body and fundus whereas EMAG is usually most prominent in the antrum. An adequate biopsy should include flat (nonpolypoid) antral and body mucosa. In AMAG, polypoid areas may represent islands of preserved oxyntic mucosa and atrophy will be missed unless the flat area near the polyp is also sampled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The incisura angularis is especially affected by metaplasia and atrophy and should be included in the biopsy protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]; biopsies from this area are typically included with the antral biopsies when staging systems such as Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) and Operative Link on Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia Assessment&nbsp;(OLGIM) are used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F116254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116254 \">table 1</a>)[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Immunostaining for endocrine cells (ie, G cells and ECL cells) is also helpful for confirming that pseudopyloric metaplasia has replaced oxyntic mucosa. G cells are sparse or absent in pseudopyloric glands; in comparison, they are plentiful in biopsy specimens from the true antrum in AMAG and EMAG, except when there is marked antral intestinal metaplasia and atrophy. The presence of ECL cell hyperplasia in patients with AMAG can help confirm that a biopsy specimen is from the body or fundus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Is there sufficient intestinal metaplasia for a definite biopsy diagnosis of EMAG?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric biopsy specimens in patients without EMAG frequently show intestinal metaplasia (IM) in a single or a few nests of glands. We suggest a diagnosis of EMAG should <strong>not</strong> be made from biopsy specimens unless at least 20 percent of the available antral or transitional mucosa is replaced by metaplastic glands, or there is unequivocal glandular atrophy. The specimen is therefore reported as showing &quot;focal intestinalization,&quot; and EMAG is considered only &quot;possible&quot; when a small proportion of the sampled mucosa (&lt;20 percent) is intestinalized and glandular atrophy is lacking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intestinal type of gastric adenocarcinoma does not arise de novo. Gastritis is usually the first step in cancer induction regardless of the cause. A sequence of changes occurs, beginning with persistent inflammation, passing through IM, p53 alteration, and dysplasia to end in intestinal type cancer. This model of gastric carcinogenesis is known as Correa's cascade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/1,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30</a>].</p><p>Although it is clear that IM is an intermediate stage in the development of gastric cancer, there is no consensus as to the magnitude of risk in individual patients with IM. It is apparent that in high-risk populations, IM has a significant rate of progression to neoplasia, perhaps warranting screening interventions, but this may not be appropriate in average-risk populations. The key appears to be defining which patients fall within the high-risk category for screening.</p><p>High-risk characteristics may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of gastric cancer.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residence in or migration from a high-risk geographic location.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Member of a high-risk ethnic population.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysplasia on biopsy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive IM on biopsies. The extent of IM is probably more important than the metaplastic subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OLGA or OLGIM Stage III or IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F116254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116254 \">table 1</a>) </p><p/><p>Studies have examined genetic factors in IM, dysplasia and gastric carcinoma in a search for biomarkers that may further characterize high-risk populations. Such markers have included microsatellite instability or loss of heterozygosity of a tumor suppressor gene. No reliable markers of the propensity of IM to progress to gastric cancer have yet been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE ENDOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic screening and surveillance for gastric adenocarcinoma in patients found to have gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) has not been studied as extensively as surveillance for esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett's (metaplastic) esophagus.</p><p>A diagnosis of IM in gastric biopsies is frequent in populations at high gastric cancer risk, such as those of East Asia and the Andean regions of Latin America, but not in developed countries of North America and Western Europe. Immigrants from high-risk countries also have high prevalence of IM. The cancer risk is proportional to the extent of IM. The low incidence of gastric cancer in developed countries would likely make a surveillance program impractical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Furthermore, IM is not as easy to recognize endoscopically in the stomach as compared with the esophagus, although this could be changing with enhanced imaging methods such as narrow-band imaging, confocal endomicroscopy, and chromoendoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/22,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,44</a>]. These methods may allow for a more precise identification and mapping of IM in the future, permitting clinicians to better identify patients who would most benefit from surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/59,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,61</a>]. A cohort study from the United Kingdom suggested that annual surveillance of patients with &quot;high-risk&quot; endoscopic findings (which included dysplasia, IM, atrophic gastritis, foveolar hyperplasia, regenerative changes, polyps, or gastric ulcers) may lead to the earlier detection of gastric cancer and possibly improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The 2006 ASGE guideline has more specific recommendations for patients with pernicious anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single endoscopy should be performed to identify prevalent lesions (carcinoid tumors and gastric cancer), but there are insufficient data to support routine subsequent endoscopic surveillance for these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surveillance of carcinoid tumors is controversial and should be individualized.</p><p/><p>In 2012, an international consensus group developed evidence-based guidelines on the management of precancerous lesions of the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The guidelines recommended endoscopic surveillance every three years after diagnosis in all patients with extensive mucosal atrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IM in the antrum and corpus. Surveillance and management of IM and gastric neuroendocrine tumors are discussed in detail separately.
