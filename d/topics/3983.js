Its name was changed to human herpesvirus 6 as its tropism was further characterized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>There are two HHV-6 variants, HHV-6A and HHV-6B. Based on their distinctive biological properties and genome sequences, HHV-6A and HHV-6B have been classified as two distinct herpesvirus species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The vast majority of documented primary infections and reactivation events are due to HHV-6B. HHV-6B infects most children within the first three years of life and, like other herpesviruses, it establishes latency after primary infection. HHV-6B may reactivate in immunocompromised hosts, especially following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Little is known about the epidemiology or clinical implications of HHV-6A. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of HHV-6 infection in adults will be presented here. The virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of HHV-6 infection, as well as clinical issues in children, are presented separately; HHV-6 infection in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients is also discussed elsewhere.

In suspected HHV-6 encephalitis, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be normal or demonstrate focal findings, such as enhancement in the temporal lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Serodiagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of tests are available for the detection of HHV-6 IgG antibody responses.

However, approximately 5 percent of healthy adults are IgM positive at any given time, making this test unreliable for a definitive diagnosis.

Its name was changed to human herpesvirus 6 as its tropism was further characterized. Like most herpesviruses, HHV-6 may remain latent in certain host cells after primary infection but can be reactivated in immunocompromised patients. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-6 infections usually occur during childhood and result in generally mild, self-limited illnesses. Primary infection in adults is rare. However, a mononucleosis-like syndrome of varying severity with prolonged lymphadenopathy has been described in association with HHV-6 seroconversion in adults. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompetent hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encephalitis of variable severity has been associated rarely with HHV-6 infection in immunocompetent patients. Clinical presentations have included altered level of consciousness, seizures, psychosis, acute cerebellar ataxia, and focal neurological signs (eg, cranial nerve deficits or hemiparesis). Neurologic outcomes have varied from full recovery to death. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Encephalitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-6 has been associated with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). HHV-6 DNA was recovered from brain biopsies from patients with MTLE more frequently than in controls, suggesting a pathogenic effect of the virus. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppression secondary to solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) favors reactivation and replication of HHV-6 and may result in viremia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical illness. Clinical syndromes associated with HHV-6 in transplant recipients include pneumonitis, hepatitis, encephalitis, and bone marrow suppression. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Transplant recipients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associations between HHV-6 and several diseases have been proposed but not proven. These include multiple sclerosis, hepatic failure, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease [SEID]), neoplasia, and myocarditis. (See <a href=\"#H3557047\" class=\"local\">'Unproven associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since HHV-6 infection is common in childhood, most adults demonstrate antibodies to the virus. Most illnesses in adults result from immunosuppression and reactivation of latent infection.
