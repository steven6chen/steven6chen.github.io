Despite advances in burn care, control of burn pain is often inadequate during the acute and chronic rehabilitation phases of burn care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pain is among the most common causes of distress during the first year after recovery and, hence, should be aggressively managed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Burn pain management is typically based upon clinical experience and physician <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> institutional preference, since available evidence is insufficient to clearly support one approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>The approach to the management of patients with acute, background, procedural, and chronic pain secondary to burns will be discussed here. An overview of the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options for managing burn pain is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of burn wound pain and itching&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92727767\"><span class=\"h1\">BURN PAIN PARADIGM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A burn pain paradigm guides the use of analgesics for management of the different phases and variability of burn pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This paradigm is based upon five phases of burn pain occurrence and includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Background pain</strong> &ndash; Pain that is present while the patient is at rest, results from the thermal tissue injury itself, and is typically of low-to-moderate intensity and long duration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Procedural pain</strong> &ndash; Brief but intense pain that is generated by wound debridement and dressing changes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rehabilitation activities (eg, physical therapy and occupational therapy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Breakthrough pain</strong> &ndash; Unexpected spiking of pain levels that occurs when current analgesic effects are exceeded, either at rest, during procedures, or with anxiety. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postoperative pain</strong> &ndash; A predictable and temporary increase in pain occurs after burn excision, donor skin harvesting, and grafting, due to the creation of new and painful wounds in the process. The duration of pain is typically two to five days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic pain</strong> &ndash; Pain that lasts longer than six months or remains after all burn wounds and skin graft donor sites have healed. The most common form of chronic pain is neuropathic pain, which is the result of damage sustained by the nerve endings in the skin. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92728281\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES IN MANAGING BURN PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute and chronic burn pain is challenging to treat because of multiple components that must be addressed and the changing patterns of pain with time: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Variability of pain</strong> &ndash; Burn pain is variable among patients and within each individual. Adequate pain management must be directed toward the current situation. As an example, burn pain can be excruciating with dressing changes and physical therapy but less painful when the burn sites are undisturbed (background pain).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dosing of analgesics</strong> &ndash; Opioid analgesic dosing is based on patient weight, which is variable in the burn patient due to physiologic fluid shifts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;, section on 'Hypermetabolic response'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharmacokinetics</strong> &ndash; Burn injuries result in variable and often unpredictable changes in volume of distribution and clearance of anesthetics and analgesics, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Route of drug administration</strong> &ndash; Options include intravenous, inhalation, oral, transmucosal, enteral tube, or rectal. The intravenous route provides rapid onset and short duration of pain relief and is used for patients with moderate-to-severe burns, and monitoring of vital signs is mandatory. Oral administration is ideal for the outpatient setting. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Opioid tolerance</strong> &ndash; Tolerance to analgesic effects generally occurs after more than two weeks of opioid use. The frequency of opioid tolerance has not been objectively documented in burn patients, but clinical experience is that the majority of burn patients receiving opioids on a daily basis develop analgesic tolerance during the initial weeks of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], possibly due to pharmacodynamic changes at the opioid receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Over time, a higher dose of medication is needed to achieve the same level of pain relief. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperalgesia</strong> &ndash; Hyperalgesia is an increased sensitivity to pain and is induced by the acute inflammatory response of a burn injury. Primary hyperalgesia occurs in the tissues directly damaged by the burn. Secondary hyperalgesia occurs in the normal tissues adjacent to the burn. Continued or repeated painful stimuli associated with background pain or repeated procedural pain can cause central nervous system adaptations that amplify the pain experience (ie, windup). Such pain may be opioid resistant and become irreversible and thus contribute to ineffective opioid analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92728594\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUGS AND DOSING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug options and dosing for opioids, nonopioids, benzodiazepines, and adjuvant analgesics are provided separately.

The sections below provide an approach to treatment of burn pain based upon the five phases of the burn pain paradigm. The regimens used at our institution are illustrated in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59472\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59472 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Selection of an analgesic regimen is based upon the clinical setting, the effectiveness of the approach in alleviating pain, and clinician and institutional preferences. No regimen is appropriate in all settings, and there is no high-quality evidence that any particular regimen is more effective than another. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching#H11800898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of burn wound pain and itching&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic treatment options'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching#H11800906\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of burn wound pain and itching&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic treatment options'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the regular use of a weight-based medication worksheet (placed at the bedside and in the patient record) containing all analgesic and resuscitation drugs provides a supplemental safeguard against accidental overdose in pediatric patients. This is particularly important in the young pediatric age group, where risks from analgesia and clinical unfamiliarity are both elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13088214\"><span class=\"h2\">Background pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic management strategies relieve background pain. Background pain decreases with time as the burn wound and associated donor skin graft sites heal, and analgesics can be slowly tapered as the pain lessens in severity and frequency. The optimal treatment of background pain is mildly to moderately potent analgesics administered so that plasma drug concentrations remain relatively constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Pharmacologic approaches: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous intravenous (IV) opioid infusions, such as patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral administration of long-acting opioids with prolonged elimination (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>) or prolonged enteral absorption (sustained-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral administration on a regular schedule of short-acting oral opioid analgesics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) </p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching#H11800898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of burn wound pain and itching&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic treatment options'</a>.)</p><p>Nonpharmacologic approaches: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation techniques including meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Information provision </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced coping skills </p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching#H11800906\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of burn wound pain and itching&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic treatment options'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13088221\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedural pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticipatory anxiety is an important issue that can develop with the repeated performance of wound care. When adequate analgesia is not provided for an initial, painful procedure, the effectiveness of analgesia for subsequent procedures is reduced, in large part due to anticipatory anxiety and heightened arousal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Thus, efforts to provide effective procedural burn pain management should begin with the first wound care procedure. </p><p>Dressing changes produce pain that is more intense and shorter in duration than background pain and are optimally managed using potent sedation, analgesia, anxiolytics, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, it is impractical to use general anesthesia on a daily basis. Nonetheless, the provision of deep sedation with carefully titrated inhaled or IV anesthetic agents, brief general anesthetics, and regional analgesic techniques can have a role in procedural burn pain settings. Nonpharmacologic techniques (eg, information provision, distraction, relaxation) serve as an adjunct to pharmacologic management.</p><p>Administration of moderate or deep sedation should follow institutional guidelines developed for safety and efficacy. Such guidelines have been established by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and adopted by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These guidelines dictate the safety monitoring requirements and specific agents that can be used for procedural analgesia, as some of the more potent opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a>) or anesthetics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>) may result in excessive sedation. </p><p>Typical pharmacologic analgesic regimens include moderately to highly potent opioids with a short duration of action, often in combination with anxiolytics (eg, benzodiazepines). However, nonopioid agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> are used in some centers, particularly in children. The use of potent opioid analgesics and anxiolytics can occur in settings with or without intravenous access, yet always requires adequate monitoring, personnel, and resuscitation equipment. For most burn wound debridement procedures, opioid analgesia with or without the concurrent use of anxiolytic sedatives (eg, benzodiazepines) will often produce mild-to-moderate sedation. </p><p>The following illustrate the pharmacologic approaches to procedural pain, based upon anticipated severity of pain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe procedural pain &ndash; General anesthesia, deep sedation, or regional anesthesia is useful for severely painful dressing changes or ones that require extreme cooperation in a noncompliant patient (eg, face debridement in a young child) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild-to-moderate procedural pain &ndash; Intravenous and inhalation medications have a rapid onset of action and a short duration of activity, while oral agents have a prolonged onset of action and duration.

Propofol is particularly advantageous as it can be titrated to effect both in terms of level of consciousness and duration of action using continuous IV infusion techniques and has the additional benefit of a rapid awakening with a minimal risk of nausea. However, propofol is more rapidly cleared and has a higher volume of distribution in burn patients, necessitating careful increases in dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p>Nonpharmacologic approaches: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation techniques, including meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypnosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distraction &ndash; media (iPad games, videos, etc.), bubbles, songs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Information provision </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced coping skills </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13088228\"><span class=\"h2\">Breakthrough pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breakthrough pain occurs when the comfort provided by background pain management is exceeded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The cause of breakthrough pain includes inadequate background analgesic management, development of opioid tolerance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes in the burn wound that increase pain (eg, proliferation of epidermal skin buds during the spontaneous burn healing process, burn wound infection). A change in the pharmacologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonpharmacologic pain management is based upon the correct diagnosis for the breakthrough pain.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also be used as a nonopioid option.

These approaches include diversion techniques and relaxation techniques and can target healthy lifestyle choices and more adaptive thinking styles.

Despite advances in various aspects of burn care, control of burn pain is often inadequate during the acute and chronic rehabilitation phases of burn care. Pain is among the most common causes of distress during the first year after recovery and, hence, should be aggressively managed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal management of burn pain requires a structured approach that incorporates both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies, targets the specific clinical pain settings unique to the burn patient, and is individualized to meet specific patient needs and institutional capabilities. (See <a href=\"#H92728112\" class=\"local\">'Paradigm-based management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A burn pain paradigm can be used to guide management of the different phases and variability of burn pain. This paradigm is based upon five phases of burn pain occurrence: background, procedural, breakthrough, postoperative, and chronic. (See <a href=\"#H92727767\" class=\"local\">'Burn pain paradigm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For background pain management, the combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic techniques can be used. We suggest using continuous or scheduled intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> for pain management in the critical care setting (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients who are tolerating oral intake, the regimen can be adjusted to include scheduled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, extended release morphine, and eventually nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs <span class=\"nowrap\">(NSAIDs)/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a></span>. (See <a href=\"#H13088214\" class=\"local\">'Background pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For procedural pain management (eg, dressing changes), the combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic techniques can be used. The approach depends on the anticipated pain caused by the procedure. For procedures that are severely painful, we suggest general or regional anesthesia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For mildly-to-moderately painful procedures, a drug with rapid onset and short duration in combination with a nonpharmacologic technique (eg, information provision) may be sufficient. Appropriate regimens are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59472\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59472 \">table 1</a>). For procedures that cause minor pain, mild pharmacologic sedation with nonpharmacologic approaches will usually suffice. (See <a href=\"#H13088221\" class=\"local\">'Procedural pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For postoperative pain management, a transient increase in dosing of opioids and the use of regional anesthetics can be added as needed. We suggest using intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> for the critical care setting (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For noncritical care settings, when intravenous (IV) access is not available, postoperative pain can be managed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a>. Nonpharmacologic techniques that were effective prior to the operation and that matched a person's coping style should continue to be used in the postoperative period. A particularly helpful technique is information provision. (See <a href=\"#H13088235\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For chronic and neuropathic pain management, the combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic techniques may be useful in managing pain. We suggest opioids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonopioid regimens, with adjustments of the doses and dosing schedule based upon response (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Nonpharmacologic options, such as cognitive distraction and relaxation techniques, should focus on the impact of chronic pain. (See <a href=\"#H13088242\" class=\"local\">'Chronic pain'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paradigm-based-treatment-approaches-for-burn-pain-control/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Retrouvey H, Shahrokhi S.
