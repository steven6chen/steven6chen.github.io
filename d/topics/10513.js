This can be particularly difficult in the period immediately following completion of radiation in patients treated with chemoradiation. This phenomenon has been termed &quot;pseudoprogression&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Pseudoprogression is a subacute treatment-related effect with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features mimicking tumor progression, usually occurring within three months of completion of chemoradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The diagnosis is typically made retrospectively, based upon spontaneous improvement or stabilization of imaging findings in the setting of continuation of the original chemotherapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a>) for at least six months. </p><p>In retrospective series, the reported frequency of pseudoprogression after chemoradiation ranges from approximately 15 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. Of those patients with worsened imaging findings at the completion of chemoradiation, approximately 30 to 50 percent have pseudoprogression as determined clinically or with biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. While no single clinical or imaging feature can distinguish between pseudoprogression and true progression, the following features can be helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of symptoms &ndash; Pseudoprogression is often asymptomatic, whereas true progression is more likely to be associated with clinical decline. In one large retrospective series, symptoms were present in 67 percent of patients with true progression and 33 percent of those with pseudoprogression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (<em>MGMT</em>) status &ndash; An unmethylated <em>MGMT</em> promotor increases the likelihood of true progression. In a series of 103 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, pseudoprogression was associated with the presence of <em>MGMT</em> methylation and with a better overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. By contrast, early progression was significantly more common among those without <em>MGMT</em> methylation and was associated with a shorter survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specialized imaging &ndash; While specialized imaging (eg, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, tumor perfusion, positron emission tomography) does not reliably distinguish between pseudoprogression and true progression, features such as a lactate peak and decreased cerebral blood volume may increase the likelihood of pseudoprogression.</p><p/><p>Patients with imaging evidence suggesting progression four to six weeks after completion of radiation and concurrent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> are typically demonstrating early treatment effect rather than disease progression, and thus should be continued on their planned adjuvant chemotherapy unless there is evidence of clinical deterioration or until there is evidence of further changes suggestive of disease progression on imaging.</p><p>Surgery may be required to distinguish between treatment-induced tumor necrosis and progressive disease. If the predominant finding at surgery is necrosis, continuation of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1035015318\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF RESPONSE AND PROGRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient management decisions require an assessment of both response to treatment as well as subsequent evidence of progressive disease. Traditionally, this approach has used the Macdonald criteria, which rely upon measurement of areas of contrast enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Revised criteria by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group address problems in assessing patients with pseudoprogression or in assessing progressive disease in patients with nonenhancing lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-disease-status-and-surveillance-after-treatment-in-patients-with-primary-brain-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of disease status and surveillance after treatment in patients with primary brain tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2728170416\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent high-grade gliomas are associated with a median overall survival of less than one year, and many patients have significant tumor-related symptoms and morbidity. While interventions such as systemic therapy, reoperation, and reirradiation can benefit selected patients, all treatments are palliative and associated with risks and side effects. Further therapy, even when successful, rarely restores neurologic function that has already been lost. Regardless of whether subsequent treatment is pursued, patients should be offered maximal supportive care, including palliative care and hospice when appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>One of the most important prognostic factors for benefit from reintervention is the pretreatment performance status&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. Other factors that are useful in predicting the likelihood of benefit from second-line therapy include the extent of disease, the histologic grade (both at initial therapy and at recurrence), the relapse-free interval, and recurrence pattern (ie, local versus diffuse) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. Patients with a localized recurrence, particularly after a prolonged period of stability, are better candidates for interventions such as reoperation or reirradiation than those with primary refractory disease or diffuse, multifocal tumors. Similarly, patients with a prior low-grade tumor that has progressed to a high-grade glioma are more likely to respond to therapy than those with primary glioblastoma. </p><p>Often there is no better treatment than participation in a clinical trial. For patients who are unwilling or unable to participate in a clinical trial, treatment decisions at this stage must be individualized, taking into account patient preferences, prior therapies received, functional status, quality of life, and overall goals of care. The approach below is summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97612\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97612 \">algorithm 1</a>) and is generally consistent with consensus-based guidelines published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) as well as the European Association for Neuro-Oncology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1035013553\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with good performance status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who maintain a good performance status at the time of recurrence or progression are candidates for further therapy that must be tailored to the pattern of recurrence, the underlying histology, and prior treatments received. Referral to a multidisciplinary brain tumor center <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> review by a multidisciplinary tumor board are encouraged given the range of options spanning multiple specialties.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best candidates for reoperation are patients with large but well-circumscribed, symptomatic tumors that are amenable to complete or near-complete resection, particularly if the tumor has recurred or progressed after an extended interval. Surgical resection does not achieve durable tumor control and is typically followed by further systemic therapy, unless <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carmustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carmustine</a> wafers are placed at the time of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1035016025\" class=\"local\">'Reoperation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The value of reirradiation of high-grade gliomas is uncertain but may benefit selected patients, especially those with a history of a low-grade tumor that has recurred as a high-grade tumor after an extended interval. Reirradiation is occasionally used in patients with a localized or out-of-field glioblastoma recurrence, particularly if there is a contraindication to further systemic therapy such as myelosuppression. (See <a href=\"#H1035016058\" class=\"local\">'Reirradiation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic options for patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> (in some countries), second-line chemotherapy (eg, nitrosoureas, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> rechallenge), or bevacizumab. For most patients with recurrent glioblastoma who do not choose to participate in a clinical trial, single-agent therapy with one of these agents is suggested as second-line therapy. Chemotherapy may be a better second-line option for patients with recurrent anaplastic gliomas with codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q, since these tumors are expected to be more chemosensitive. Alternating electric fields are available as a salvage therapy for interested patients with recurrent glioblastoma. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1035017051\" class=\"local\">'Alternating electric fields'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-anaplastic-oligodendroglial-tumors#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors&quot;, section on 'Recurrent disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1035013560\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with poor performance status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a poor performance status have a low likelihood of response to salvage therapy and an increased risk of toxicity. In many cases, the risks of pursuing subsequent treatment outweigh the benefits. One caveat is that patients whose decline has been driven primarily by peritumoral edema or steroid toxicities may benefit from a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, which can improve symptoms by virtue of its antiedema and steroid-sparing effects.

Only approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients with recurrent glioblastoma are candidates for a second surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy is frequently necessary to distinguish recurrent viable tumor from the effects of treatment, such as radiation necrosis. Both of these entities will enhance on postgadolinium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, and biopsy can provide tissue to differentiate between these two entities. Small biopsy specimens may not be adequate to make the diagnosis due to sampling error, however, and larger samples are sometimes required. Even with adequate tissue it is not always possible to distinguish the two entities, as there may be a mix of both treatment effect and viable tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, initial surgical approach, and prognosis of high-grade gliomas&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications for a debulking reoperation in a patient with recurrent disease are not firmly established. The median survival for patients undergoing surgery for recurrent glioblastoma ranges from 8 to 12 months in most series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/14,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23,24</a>] and ranges from 12 to 18 months for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/12,13,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,25</a>]. The same imaging advances and intraoperative techniques used in the initial treatment of patients with high-grade gliomas are valuable in patients being treated for recurrent or progressive disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, initial surgical approach, and prognosis of high-grade gliomas&quot;, section on 'Intraoperative techniques'</a>.)</p><p/><p>There is no evidence to suggest that these results are better than can be expected with radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy alone. However, selected patients may benefit from reoperation (eg, those with a bulky tumor exerting symptomatic mass effect). The most significant predictor of longer survival after reoperation is a good performance status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/12,13,23,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,23,25,26</a>]. Other favorable prognostic variables include young age, a longer interval since the original surgery, and the extent of the second surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/12,13,20,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,20,25-28</a>]. One study found that ependymal involvement was the most important negative prognostic factor in patients undergoing reoperation for glioblastoma, independent of performance status, tumor size, and extent of resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Particular caution is required in patients who had been treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> preoperatively because of the risk of wound-healing complications.

The administration of a tumoricidal dose is limited by potentially fatal or severe treatment-related toxicity, since most patients will have undergone adjuvant radiation with maximally tolerated doses at the time of primary therapy. However, focal reirradiation may be possible in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Exceptions can sometimes be made for the rare patient who relapses four or more years after initial radiation therapy, but even then, reduced dose and conservative volumes are suggested to minimize toxicity.</p><p>A variety of radiation-delivery modalities can be used to deliver fractionated reirradiation to the brain; selection is based on preference of the treating radiation oncologist and local availability, since there are no clear differences in efficacy.</p><p>Results with reirradiation are illustrated by an observational series that included 101 patients with high-grade gliomas, in which the median survival was 12 months for patients with grade III tumors and 8 months for those with grade IV lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

This approach is being investigated in an ongoing randomized phase II study sponsored by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), in which patients with recurrent glioblastoma are treated with repeat external beam irradiation (35 Gy in 10 fractions) with or without bevacizumab (RTOG 1205, NCT01730950).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1035016091\"><span class=\"h3\">Stereotactic radiosurgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experience with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is limited, and interpretation of results is limited by the lack of randomized clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/33,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36-38</a>].</p><p>In a series of 114 consecutive patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas treated with SRS, the median progression-free survival for patients with grade III and grade IV tumors was 8.6 and 4.6 months, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

The initial treatment may induce imaging changes that are difficult to distinguish from progressive disease. Continued treatment with adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> is warranted until there is evidence that such imaging changes actually represent disease progression. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Early progression versus pseudoprogression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the use of a combined-modality approach, most patients eventually relapse. The management of patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma is difficult, and active reintervention has not been proven to prolong survival. Treatment decisions at this stage must be individualized, taking into account patient preferences, prior therapies received, functional status, quality of life, and overall goals of care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97612\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97612 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery may be useful in carefully selected patients to distinguish between tumor recurrence and treatment-induced necrosis, to debulk a localized tumor recurrence, or to provide symptom palliation. Focal reirradiation may also be useful in selected patients with a localized recurrence, particularly after a prolonged period of stability. (See <a href=\"#H1035015994\" class=\"local\">'Localized therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma who are selected for systemic therapy, we suggest single-agent therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lomustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lomustine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Absent a major difference in efficacy, the choice among therapies is based on consideration of treatment history, side effect profiles, tumor size and extent of surrounding edema, steroid requirements, and patient preferences.
