Studies of the mechanisms of atherosclerosis suggest that antioxidants might be protective. Observational studies appeared to show benefits with higher intake of some antioxidants. Additionally, cardiovascular protection has been associated with dietary patterns high in antioxidants (from fruit and vegetables) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-antioxidants-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and with higher circulating levels of alpha-tocopherol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-antioxidants-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, most randomized controlled trials have not found antioxidant supplementation to be effective for the prevention of CHD.</p><p>The potential efficacy of the nutritional antioxidants <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>, vitamin C, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> and other carotenoids is reviewed here. Each is considered separately, as each appears to have distinct risks and benefits.</p><p>It is more difficult to assess the efficacy of dietary antioxidants in randomized trials. The association between dietary antioxidants and cardioprotection, despite the lack of benefits seen in trials of supplements, may reflect issues of confounding and bias in observational studies or may occur because the full complement of antioxidants in foods are different from what is found in supplements or are present in more optimal ratios.</p><p>The role of antioxidants in conditions other than CHD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin supplementation in disease prevention&quot;, section on 'Antioxidant vitamins'</a>.)</p><p>Also discussed separately are the effects of the antioxidant probucol on lipids and the effects of probucol and succinobucol on cardiovascular outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering-with-drugs-other-than-statins-and-pcsk9-inhibitors#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Low density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering with drugs other than statins and PCSK9 inhibitors&quot;, section on 'Probucol'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammation and oxidative stress are critical to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Oxidation of proteins and lipid peroxidation of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids in lipoproteins by reactive oxygen species can facilitate the development of atherosclerotic lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72955\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72955 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-antioxidants-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Absolute levels of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are proportional to those of total LDL. Thus, oxidatively modified LDL species are likely to be greater in hypercholesterolemic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-antioxidants-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>] and among those with metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-antioxidants-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>There is, however, considerable interindividual variability in oxyradical generation. This variability may be dependent in part upon the distribution of LDL subspecies, since small dense LDLs are more susceptible to oxidative modification than large buoyant LDL subspecies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-antioxidants-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The small dense LDL profile often coexists with elevated triglycerides and both attributes appear to confer cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-antioxidants-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Data from the Physicians&rsquo; Health Study, for example, demonstrated that elevated nonfasting triglycerides and a predominance of small dense LDL particles were highly predictive of future myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-antioxidants-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Furthermore, men with dense LDL profiles appear to benefit most from risk reduction interventions as assessed by angiographic changes over four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-antioxidants-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Another factor that may influence the variability of oxidative stress from one individual to another is the inactivation of reactive oxygen species by endogenous enzymes. In one study, the activity of glutathione oxidase 1, a key intracellular antioxidant enzyme, was measured in red blood cells in 636 patients with suspected coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-antioxidants-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Such a benefit might be mediated by several mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64231\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64231 \">figure 2</a>).
