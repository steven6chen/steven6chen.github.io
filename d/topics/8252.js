High-grade NENs of the GI tract and pancreas are a heterogeneous group of aggressive malignancies. Most are poorly differentiated high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) with a high propensity for distant metastases and an ominous prognosis, even when clinically localized. A subset are high grade by proliferative or mitotic rate but demonstrate well-differentiated histology (well-differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors [NETs]) and have a prognosis that is midway between the high-grade poorly differentiated NECs and well-differentiated grade 2 NETs, which are more indolent.

All poorly differentiated NENs were defined as high-grade (G3) neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) according to this classification.

As an example, in one series of 425 patients with a pancreatic NEN, five-year survival rates for low-, intermediate-, and high-grade tumors were 75, 62, and 7 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92260254\"><span class=\"h2\">Poorly differentiated NECs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, all high-grade poorly differentiated gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NECs have an aggressive natural history that is characterized by early, widespread metastases. Patients who present with locoregional disease may be cured by aggressive therapy; however, many relapse, and then the overall prognosis is poor. These tumors show similarities in morphology, biologic behavior, and chemotherapy responsiveness to poorly differentiated (small cell and large cell) NECs of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Similar to their lung counterparts, GEP NECs have been traditionally divided into large cell and small cell subtypes based on the morphologic features of the individual tumor cells (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H1176454\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'Neuroendocrine tumors'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small cell carcinoma was the first category described in both the lungs and GI tract, and for this reason, most of the published literature on extrapulmonary poorly differentiated NECs (which can arise in sites other than the GI tract and pancreas) is focused on small cell carcinoma.

There are also several differences in the mutational frequencies: GEP NEC seems to have a lower rate of mutations in the <em>TP53</em> gene and alterations in expression of the <em>RB1</em> gene than SCLC, and other genes are more frequently altered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. One-half of small cell pancreatic NECs have <em>KRAS</em> mutations, in contrast to SCLC where <em>KRAS</em> mutations are rarely found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. On the other hand, SCLC has a greater than 90 percent incidence of loss of <em>RB1</em> gene function, compared with 60 percent in pancreatic small cell NEC.

While it is true that nearly all poorly differentiated cancers have a high proliferation rate, not all G3 tumors are poorly differentiated. A subset of patients with NENs that appear histologically well differentiated is associated with Ki-67 proliferation indices &gt;20 percent, usually in the 20 to 55 percent range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. They have been designated well-differentiated NET G3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In 2017, an updated WHO classification for pancreatic NENs formally recognized the category of well-differentiated NET G3, to be distinguished from poorly differentiated NEC G3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115945 \">table 2</a>).

The only prospective data come from the Pronet study, a one-year prospective epidemiologic study among French pathologists to assess the characteristics of newly diagnosed NENs, including a review of the diagnostic pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Of the 1340 cases that were collected, 104 were G3, of which 21 (20 percent) were described by the participating pathologists as well or moderately differentiated.</p><p>Few data are available on the presentation of NET G3 as compared with NECs, including the primary tumor location, percentage with elevated tumor markers, uptake on somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, and Ki-67 index (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111374\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111374 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/30,35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35-39</a>]. The possibility of a NET G3 should especially be examined when the Ki-67 index is between 20 and 55 percent, if somatostatin receptor imaging is positive, and when a pancreatic primary is present.</p><p>The clinical behavior of these tumors appears to differ from that of high-grade poorly differentiated NECs. Median survival of patients with NET G3 tumors is more than double that of patients with poorly differentiated high-grade neoplasms (40 versus 17 months in one study, 32 versus 15 months in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>]).

The diagnostic workup of a GEP neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) differs from the diagnostic evaluation of a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (NET) in at least two ways: the roles of both tumor markers (ie, serum CgA, urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid [5-HIAA]) and somatostatin receptor imaging (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a> [68-Ga DOTATATE]-positron emission tomography [PET] or Octreoscan) are minor unless the patient is suspected of having a well-differentiated high-grade (G3) NET.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463615391\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of neuroendocrine cells is the production of abundant neurosecretory granules, as reflected in the strong and diffuse immunohistochemical expression of neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin and chromogranin. All neoplasms with neuroendocrine differentiation should be assessed for grade and extent of differentiation. Differentiation refers to the resemblance of the tumor histology to its normal counterparts, whereas grade describes the proliferative activity of the tumor, as measured by mitotic rate or Ki-67 rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111125\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111125 \">table 4</a>).

There are two distinct histologic entities: small cell and large cell NEC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F98814\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98814 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Small cell carcinomas are composed of small- to medium-sized, round to oval cells with scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei with indistinct nucleoli. The large cell subtype is composed of large cells with vesicular nuclei showing prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. In both cases, the tumor cells grow in sheets, forming nest-like structures, often with large confluent areas of necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

The cells are relatively uniform, and they have round to oval nuclei, coarsely stippled chromatin, and finely granular cytoplasm. </p><p/><p>Histologically, when a pathologist is assessing a NEN G3, morphological features may not always be reliable in separating a well-differentiated NET from a poorly differentiated NEC. Furthermore, there is no Ki-67 index cutoff within the G3 range (&gt;20 percent) that sharply separates these two neoplasms; an extremely high Ki-67 (&gt;75 percent) usually points to NEC, but rates in the 20 to 55 percent range can be seen with either NET or NEC. A mitotic rate greater than 20 per 10 high-powered fields (HPF) usually indicates a NEC, since most NETs fall into the G3 range solely based on Ki-67 index.

High-grade (G3) NENs of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies. Most are poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) G3 with a high propensity for distant metastases and an ominous prognosis, even when clinically localized. A subset are G3 but well differentiated (neuroendocrine tumor [NET] G3) and have a prognosis that is midway between the poorly differentiated NEC G3 and well-differentiated intermediate-grade (G2) NETs, which are more indolent. (See <a href=\"#H463615344\" class=\"local\">'Classification and biologic behavior'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We restrict use of the term NET to designate well-differentiated tumors that are further classified by grade (low-grade [G1] NET, NET G2, and NET G3), regardless of the site of origin. In contrast, the term NEC implies a poorly differentiated, G3 carcinoma. The term NEN G3 covers all G3 neuroendocrine malignancies, both NET G3 and NEC. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within the digestive tract, the most common primary tumor locations for a gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NEC are the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and large bowel, whereas NET G3 are mainly located in the pancreas. Presenting symptoms may be generalized (eg, anorexia, fatigue, weight loss) or site specific (eg, focal pain, melena, hematochezia, dysphagia, nausea, emesis, bowel obstruction, or jaundice). A clinical presentation that is due to secretion of specific peptide hormones or bioamines (eg, insulin, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide [VIP], or gastrin) is extremely uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H463615379\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of GEP NEN G3 requires histologic examination of a tumor biopsy, with immunohistochemical demonstration of staining for markers of neuroendocrine differentiation (synaptophysin, chromogranin A [CgA]) and determination of the proliferative rate with Ki-67 staining or mitotic index. (See <a href=\"#H463615391\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnostic workup of a GEP NEN G3 differs from the diagnostic evaluation of a well-differentiated NET in two ways: for most patients, the roles of tumor markers (serum CgA, urinary excretion of 5-hydroxlindoleacetic acid [5-HIAA]) and of diagnostic imaging using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs (111-indium pentetreotide [OctreoScan], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a>) are minor. Diagnosis and staging of NEC are typically accomplished by cross-sectional imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning. However, somatostatin receptor imaging, rather than FDG-PET scanning, is reasonable for NET G3. (See <a href=\"#H89616442\" class=\"local\">'Tumor markers'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3426672471\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic studies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a nonesophageal NEC and early stage disease, we suggest surgical resection followed by four to six cycles of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> plus a platinum drug (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Carboplatin may be preferred for patients with contraindications to or poor tolerance of cisplatin. (See <a href=\"#H463614782\" class=\"local\">'Localized disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Definitive chemoradiation seems superior to surgery for apparently localized or locoregional esophageal NECs. (See <a href=\"#H2525825402\" class=\"local\">'Role of surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1182014512\" class=\"local\">'Chemoradiotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For locally advanced, nonmetastatic nonesophageal NEC (eg, T3N1 or T4), we suggest multimodality treatment that includes chemotherapy in all cases, individualization of the use of radiation therapy depending on location and risk of locoregional recurrence, as well as surgery when feasible.&nbsp;Given the aggressive nature of poorly differentiated NECs, we often use neoadjuvant rather than adjuvant treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on extrapulmonary NECs suggest a lower frequency of central nervous metastases than has been seen with pulmonary small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and we suggest not pursuing prophylactic cranial irradiation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H346511849\" class=\"local\">'Craniospinal irradiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with metastatic NEC, rapid referral for palliative chemotherapy is necessary given the aggressive nature of these tumors. Standard palliative chemotherapy consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>; an acceptable alternative is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> plus cisplatin. (See <a href=\"#H89618368\" class=\"local\">'Initial chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal duration of treatment is not established. We typically aim for four to six cycles of therapy, but if a patient is still responding and tolerating treatment well, continuation of chemotherapy to at least maximal response is appropriate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based upon data in patients with SCLC, patients with platinum-sensitive disease may benefit from retreatment with a platinum and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> combination if relapse occurs at least three to six months after discontinuation of first-line treatment. While second-line regimens have not been evaluated rigorously, options include temozolomide-, fluoropyrimidine-, irinotecan-, and oxaliplatin-based regimens. (See <a href=\"#H463616790\" class=\"local\">'Relapsed or progressive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor prognostic signs for response to chemotherapy include advanced stage, poor performance status, high proliferation rate, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), thrombocytosis, and esophageal and colonic primary sites. (See <a href=\"#H463616989\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A minority of GEP NEN G3, particularly those of pancreatic origin, have a Ki-67 index &gt;20 percent but relatively well-differentiated histology (NET G3). The best way to treat these patients is not established. (See <a href=\"#H441838886\" class=\"local\">'High-grade, well-differentiated tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with apparently localized disease, surgery is reasonable. (See <a href=\"#H2400314657\" class=\"local\">'Localized disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with advanced NET G3 often respond relatively poorly to <span class=\"nowrap\">platinum/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a></span> regimens, and platinum-based chemotherapy may not be the most appropriate first-line treatment. Eligible patients should be encouraged to enroll in therapeutic trials testing the benefits of specific regimens. Off protocol, we do not generally treat NET G3 patients with platinum-based first-line chemotherapy, unless the disease is exceptionally aggressive at outset. Other regimens used in G1 to G2 NETs (including temozolomide-based or streptozocin-based chemotherapy) or molecularly targeted therapy may be preferable. Our current practice is to treat advanced pancreatic NET G3 with first-line temozolomide-based chemotherapy. However, platinum-based chemotherapy could be considered at the time of disease progression. (See <a href=\"#H2022036540\" class=\"local\">'Advanced disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Where available, peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRRT) is a reasonable option for GEP NET G3 with a high uptake on somatostatin receptor imaging. Although PRRT remains an investigational therapy in the United States, it is available in some other countries.
