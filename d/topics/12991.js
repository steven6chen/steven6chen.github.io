While most infections are asymptomatic or self-limited, some individuals develop acute pulmonary infections or severe and progressive disseminated infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis occurs in about one in 2000 patients with acute infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>].</p><p>Although hematogenous dissemination probably occurs in most patients during the acute infection before cellular immunity develops, progressive illness is unusual except in the host with altered immunity and those at the extremes of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/2,3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6</a>]. The diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis requires a high index of suspicion, recognition of the common modes of presentation, and familiarity with the appropriate diagnostic tests.</p><p>The pathogenesis of disseminated histoplasmosis, risk factors for dissemination, and clinical features of the infection will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and treatment of this infection and the manifestations of localized pulmonary histoplasmosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of disseminated histoplasmosis in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> is a thermally dimorphic fungus, growing as a mold in the environment and as a yeast at 37&ordm;C. Infection develops when <em>Histoplasma microconidia</em> are inhaled into the lungs, where they change into the yeast form. Neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells are attracted in response to the infection. As in tuberculosis, macrophages assist in spreading the organism via lymphatics and the blood to the adjacent lymph nodes and throughout the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, lymph nodes, adrenal glands, and bone marrow).</p><p>In patients with progressive disseminated infection, macrophages are typically engorged with yeasts, supporting the important role of intracellular proliferation of the organism. Organisms are confined to macrophages but less commonly can be seen within the tissue spaces. The organisms can occasionally be seen in peripheral white blood cells in patients with disseminated infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57613\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57613 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>T cell immunity plays the predominant role in recovery from histoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Once cellular immunity to <em>Histoplasma</em> develops, macrophages become activated to kill the organism. Cytokines including interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma arm macrophages to kill the fungus and halt progression of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Failure to activate macrophage fungicidal capacity appears to be the key defect in immunity to <em>H. capsulatum</em> in patients with progressive disseminated histoplasmosis. In one study in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, exogenous IL-12 increased IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and nitric oxide production in splenocytes and resulted in decreased colony counts of <em>H. capsulatum</em> and increased survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Antibody to IFN-gamma eliminated the protective effect of IL-12 in this model. The important role of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in patients with histoplasmosis is substantiated by the occurrence of severe disease in those receiving TNF inhibitor therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>] and in hosts with IFN-gamma receptor deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>These defense mechanisms are generally sufficient to control the infection in immunocompetent individuals, explaining the subclinical or self-limited course characteristic of acute histoplasmosis. Individuals with underlying conditions such as AIDS, or who are receiving immunosuppressive medications that impair these defenses, are at risk for developing more severe, and often fatal, progressive forms of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Reinfection and reactivation of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reinfection can occur in patients who previously had documented histoplasmosis. In persons with impaired immunity and in those who have a massive reexposure to <em>H. capsulatum</em>, host defenses against this organism can be overwhelmed and disease can recur.</p><p>Reactivation of latent histoplasmosis can also occur in immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. Presumably, viable organisms persist in the tissues following recovery from the initial episode of histoplasmosis. Development of disseminated histoplasmosis in individuals who left the endemic area years before is thought to be caused by reactivation of these quiescent foci. The finding of a mitochondrial DNA pattern characteristic of Panamanian strains of <em>H. capsulatum</em> in five Puerto Rican immigrants to New York City provided convincing evidence for reactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Cases of progressive pulmonary or disseminated histoplasmosis occurring shortly after initiation of immunosuppressive therapy with TNF inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/12,13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,18</a>] could represent worsening of smoldering infection exacerbated by recently intensified immunosuppression or newly acquired infection as well as reactivation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections&quot;, section on 'Histoplasmosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three types of tissue response have been described in disseminated histoplasmosis: diffuse histiocytosis, focal histiocytosis, and tuberculoid granulomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Histiocytosis refers to macrophage infiltration into the infected tissues. In comparison, infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells are not usually noted in the tissues of patients with progressive disseminated histoplasmosis. Granulomas are less common with disseminated infection than with other types of histoplasmosis and usually are seen in patients with lower fungal burdens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56193\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56193 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Heavy infections may cause marked enlargement of the involved organs (liver, spleen, adrenal glands, lymph nodes), occasionally displacing normal parenchymal cells and causing organ dysfunction.</p><p>At autopsy, many patients with disseminated histoplasmosis demonstrate involvement of the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, adrenal glands, and gastrointestinal tract mucosa; of those undergoing examination of the brain or meninges, two-thirds demonstrate central nervous system (CNS) involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Since autopsy experience may be biased toward the severe end of the disease spectrum, these tissues are probably less commonly involved in milder cases. Perivasculitis with necrosis is seen histopathologically in patients with more severe involvement of the meninges and adrenal glands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with disseminated histoplasmosis have underlying conditions that impair their ability to defend against intracellular pathogens. A variety of conditions have been found to predispose to disseminated histoplasmosis, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/5,6,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,19,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AIDS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary immunodeficiency or other immunosuppressive disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppressive medications, such as glucocorticoids, antirejection therapies in solid organ transplant recipients, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor therapies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremes of age</p><p/><p>A separate group of patients, most of whom are middle-aged to older men, have chronic progressive disseminated histoplasmosis and have no known underlying immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In these patients, unidentified defects in cellular immunity likely explain their inability to control the infection. The risk also may be increased during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Transplant recipients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Solid organ transplantation is a risk factor for disseminated histoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Infection in solid organ transplant recipients can occur as a new infection by inhalation of conidia or by reactivation of quiescent disease. Infection can also be transmitted from the transplant donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. This was illustrated in a report of two kidney transplant recipients who developed disseminated histoplasmosis eight and nine months after transplantation. The recipients lived in different states from one another, neither of which were endemic regions, had never traveled to endemic areas, and had no prior serological evidence of exposure to the fungus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Both received cadaveric kidneys from the same donor who had serum antibody titers of 1:16 by complement fixation, and their isolates of <em>H. capsulatum</em> had identical patterns by both polymerase chain reaction and DNA analysis, reflecting transmission from the organs.

While most infections are asymptomatic or self-limited, some individuals develop acute pulmonary infections or severe and progressive disseminated infection. Progressive illness is unusual except in the host with altered immunity and those at the extremes of age. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histoplasma capsulatum is a thermally dimorphic fungus, growing as a mold in the environment and as a yeast at 37&ordm;C. Infection develops when <em>Histoplasma microconidia</em> are inhaled into the lungs, where they change into the yeast form. In patients with progressive disseminated infection, macrophages are typically engorged with yeasts, supporting the important role of intracellular proliferation of the organism. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cell immunity plays the predominant role in recovery from histoplasmosis. Once cellular immunity to <em>Histoplasma</em> develops, macrophages become activated to kill the organism. Failure to activate macrophage fungicidal capacity appears to be the key defect in immunity to <em>H. capsulatum</em> in patients with progressive disseminated histoplasmosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reinfection can occur in patients who previously had documented histoplasmosis. In persons with impaired immunity or in those with massive exposure, reexposure to <em>H. capsulatum</em> can overcome residual host defenses against this organism. Reactivation of latent histoplasmosis can also occur in immunocompromised patients. Presumably, viable organisms persist in the tissues following recovery from the initial episode of histoplasmosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Reinfection and reactivation of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At autopsy, most patients with disseminated histoplasmosis demonstrate involvement of the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, adrenal glands, and gastrointestinal tract mucosa; of those undergoing examination of the brain or meninges, two-thirds demonstrate central nervous system (CNS) involvement. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with disseminated histoplasmosis have underlying conditions that impair their ability to defend against intracellular pathogens. A variety of conditions have been found to predispose to disseminated histoplasmosis, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>AIDS</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary immunodeficiency or other immunosuppressive disorders</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immunosuppressive medications, such as glucocorticoids, antirejection therapies in solid organ transplant recipients, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor therapies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extremes of age (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A separate group of patients, most of whom are middle-aged to older men, have chronic progressive disseminated histoplasmosis and have no known underlying immunosuppression. In these patients, unidentified defects in cellular immunity likely explain their inability to control the infection. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis as well as the timing of presentation vary based on host immunity and the degree of exposure to the fungus. Patients may present shortly after the exposure or years later and may experience asymptomatic periods interrupted by symptomatic relapses. Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis occurs in two forms, partly based upon the time course of the illness and partly upon the extent of infection:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute infection, which is mostly seen in infants and heavily immunocompromised hosts</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic infection, noted mostly in older adults and men more often than women (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severely immunodeficient patients, such as those with AIDS or those receiving treatment with immunosuppressive medications, may present with overwhelming infection manifested by shock, respiratory distress, hepatic and renal failure, obtundation, and coagulopathy. The mortality in spite of amphotericin B treatment approaches 50 percent in such cases. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with chronic infection often present with pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatic enzyme elevation, and oropharyngeal lesions. Other sites include the skin, brain, and adrenal glands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70552\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70552 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82224\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82224 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50609 \">figure 1</a>).
