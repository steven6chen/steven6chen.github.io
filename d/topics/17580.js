They are among the most serious and potentially fatal complications of transplantation. While the majority appears to be related to the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), EBV-negative disease does occur. Three general types of PTLD have been described in transplant recipients: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early lesion</strong> (ie, plasmacytic hyperplasia and infectious mononucleosis-like PTLD) &ndash; This presents as an infectious mononucleosis-type acute illness characterized by polyclonal B cell proliferation with no evidence to suggest malignant transformation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polymorphic PTLD</strong> &ndash; Polymorphic PTLD are polyclonal or monoclonal lymphoid infiltrates that demonstrate evidence of malignant transformation but do not meet all of the criteria for one of the B cell or <span class=\"nowrap\">T/NK</span> cell lymphomas recognized in immunocompetent patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monomorphic PTLD</strong> &ndash; Monomorphic PTLD are monoclonal lymphoid proliferations that meet the criteria for one of the B cell or <span class=\"nowrap\">T/NK</span> cell lymphomas recognized in immunocompetent patients.</p><p/><p>These conditions lie along a continuum of disease and are categorized by the 2008 WHO classification system as PTLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Of importance, small B cell lymphoid neoplasms (eg, follicular lymphomas, small lymphocytic lymphoma) and marginal zone (MALT) lymphomas arising in the post-transplant setting are <strong>not </strong>considered PTLD.</p><p>The treatment and prevention of PTLD following solid organ and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant will be reviewed here. The diagnosis of PTLD and the development of other secondary malignancies following transplant are discussed separately.

Attention to such measures may lessen the incidence of PTLD. In addition, many transplant centers have incorporated EBV monitoring into the routine evaluation of patients at high risk for PTLD with preemptive treatment of PTLD at the time of viral reactivation with anti-B cell monoclonal antibody treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders#H17288449\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;, section on 'Measurement of EBV viral load'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13166231\"><span class=\"h2\">Tapering immunosuppressive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy is used in the transplant setting to help prevent acute rejection, loss of the allograft, and graft-versus-host disease. While the degree of immunosuppression required and the timing of immunosuppression withdrawal differs with the clinical setting, there is general agreement that more aggressive withdrawal of immunosuppression to maintenance target concentrations is associated with lower incidence of PTLD. At times this approach is not practical, however, and alternatives are needed. </p><p>As an example, a relatively high incidence of PTLD was found with the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> (FK506). Therefore, the aggressive tapering of this agent may limit the development of this disorder. In one review of 82 children who received renal allografts with tacrolimus-based regimens, the incidence of PTLD was 17 percent (5 of 29 patients) among patients transplanted between 1989 and 1992 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence fell to 4 percent (2 of 53 cases) for those transplanted from early 1993 to 1996, a finding attributed in part to a policy of aggressive tapering of tacrolimus (and corticosteroids) to a lower maintenance target trough concentration of 5 to 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Details regarding the use of immunosuppressive therapy post-transplant are presented separately.

Data regarding the efficacy of antiviral prophylaxis in the prevention of PTLD in solid organ recipients is also limited. Many solid organ recipients receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> for herpes simplex virus (HSV) prophylaxis and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> or ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis in the post-transplant setting. A matched case controlled study showed that for every 30 days of acyclovir use the odds ratio for developing PTLD was 0.83, and for every 30 days of ganciclovir use, the odds ratio for developing PTLD was 0.62 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Support for the use of antiviral prophylaxis in the prevention of PTLD comes from retrospective studies and single-arm prospective studies described below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of both the prophylactic use of antiviral agents and the early detection of primary EBV infection with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by antiviral therapy and lowering of the immunosuppressive regimen was evaluated in 40 children receiving a liver allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The schedule of antiviral prophylaxis was determined by risk to develop PTLD as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High risk patients (eg, donor EBV-positive, recipient EBV-negative) were administered a minimum of 100 days of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> (6 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low risk patients (eg, donor EBV-negative, recipient EBV-positive or -negative; donor and recipient EBV-positive) received intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> only during the period of hospitalization followed by oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day). <br/><br/>Target <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> levels were lowered to 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in patients in whom a rising viral copy number was detected by PCR performed once per month. PTLD, which was defined as histologic evidence of B cell proliferation, was treated with the reinstitution of intravenous ganciclovir and the withdrawal of tacrolimus. At a mean follow-up of approximately 260 days, the following results were reported:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among 18 high-risk children, there were no cases of PTLD and one case of EBV infection (which resolved).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among 22 low-risk patients, two cases of PTLD occurred, both of which resolved after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> was stopped; there was one case of EBV increase, which also resolved.<br/><br/>The 5 percent incidence of PTLD with this regimen compares favorably to the incidence of 10 percent previously reported from this same center. This lower incidence combined with the finding that no high-risk patient developed PTLD suggests that aggressive preemptive therapy and frequent monitoring for early EBV infection, which (when detected) is managed by intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> and reductions in immunosuppression, may lower the incidence of PTLD. (See <a href=\"#H260801294\" class=\"local\">'Preemptive treatment of viral reactivation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective multicenter case-control study of renal transplant recipients also found that prophylactic antiviral therapy reduced the risk of PTLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this report of 100 biopsy-confirmed cases and 375 matched controls, the risk of PTLD during the first year post-transplant decreased by 38 percent for every 30 days of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> (OR of 0.62, 95% CI 0.38-1.0). The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> to ganciclovir does not appear to provide added benefit to ganciclovir alone among patients at increased risk for PTLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one large retrospective database study, use of prophylaxis with anti-CMV immunoglobulin during the first four months after kidney transplantation significantly reduced the incidence of PTLD during the first year post-transplant, but not in the subsequent five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This may have been due to temporary anti-EBV protection from the substantial anti-EBV reactivity present in the immunoglobulin preparations employed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260801294\"><span class=\"h2\">Preemptive treatment of viral reactivation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many transplant centers have incorporated EBV monitoring into the routine evaluation of patients at high risk for PTLD and preemptive treatment of PTLD at the time of viral reactivation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or reduced immunosuppression. Of the various treatment options, the approach of using preemptive rituximab therapy seems most appropriate for patients at high risk of EBV-associated PTLD and has been utilized at a number of centers with success. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one prospective study of high-risk patients undergoing partially T cell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a single infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> given to 15 patients with EBV reactivation (ie, &ge;1000 EBV genome <span class=\"nowrap\">equivalents/mL)</span> resulted in complete response in 14, as evidenced by prevention of PTLD and complete clearance of EBV-DNA from the peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study of 70 children undergoing reduced intensity conditioning with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> T cell depletion followed by allogeneic HCT prospectively monitored EBV viral load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients who developed a viral load &gt;40,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> within three months of transplant or with a low CD3 count were treated preemptively with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. When compared with historical controls, this approach was associated with a lower incidence of PTLD (1.4 versus 21.7 percent), especially among viremic patients (3 versus 63 percent). Although patients who received rituximab had significantly delayed B cell reconstitution, this was not associated with an increase in infectious mortality. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, reduction or suspension of immunosuppression was employed when EBV reactivation was detected (ie, &ge;300 genomic copies per 10<sup>5</sup> peripheral blood mononuclear cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The main options for initial treatment are reduction of immunosuppression, immunotherapy with the CD20 monoclonal antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. Other treatments, such as adoptive immunotherapy with EBV specific cytotoxic T cells, are generally reserved for persistent disease despite initial therapy, or for those patients treated at selective sites capable of performing these types of treatments, or for patients willing and able to travel to such sites.

Reduction of immunosuppression may be preferred when alternative organ support is available (eg, renal or <span class=\"nowrap\">renal/pancreas</span> transplant).

Rituximab may be considered for those patients with CD20 positive PTLD with residual disease despite reduction of immunosuppression or for those who cannot tolerate reduction of immunosuppression. While antiviral prophylaxis may decrease the incidence of PTLD, antiviral therapy has yet to demonstrate convincing efficacy in the treatment of PTLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Data regarding the efficacy of reduction of immunosuppression come largely from uncontrolled observational studies in which patients also received other treatment strategies. The majority of early lesions either resolve completely or improve significantly within three to five weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Responses are seen less commonly in other types of PTLD. Reduction of immunosuppression increases the risk of allograft rejection, which may result in death among those with heart, lung, and liver allografts. However, a careful decrease in immunosuppressive therapy based upon the individual's clinical features and type of allograft can result in both a high response rate and a low rate of rejection and allograft loss.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 42 solid organ transplant recipients with PTLD were treated with reduction of immunosuppression, and 12 also underwent surgical removal of all apparent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Overall, 31 (74 percent) achieved complete remission (CR). Among those treated with reduction of immunosuppression alone, 63 percent had a complete or partial response with a median time to documentation of response of 3.6 weeks. The response was best among patients with early onset disease; in comparison, patients with late onset or extensive disease (as manifested by elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], organ dysfunction, and multiorgan involvement) were much less likely to benefit. The response rate was 89 percent in patients with none of these risk factors, compared with none of seven patients with two or three risk factors. Twelve patients developed acute rejection, but only one lost the graft because of rejection. At a median follow-up of almost three years, 55 percent of patients were alive and 50 percent were in CR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, 148 solid organ transplant recipients with PTLD treated with reduction of immunosuppression had an overall response rate to reduction of immunosuppression of 45 percent (37 percent complete) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Approximately 40 percent developed acute rejection and 60 percent required subsequent chemotherapy. Acute rejection did not appear to correlate with the degree of reduction of immunosuppression. Three-year overall survival (OS) was 55 percent. Predictors of worse outcomes included older age (&gt;50 years), B symptoms, bone marrow or liver involvement, weight loss, hepatitis C virus infection, elevated LDH, and dyspnea. Three-year OS was 100 percent in those with no risk factors and 8 percent in patients with two or more risk factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a French, multicenter, retrospective study of 104 adults who developed PTLD after renal or simultaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">renal/pancreatic</span> transplantation between 1990 and 2007, estimated rates of graft loss or the combined endpoint of graft loss or death with a functioning graft at 10 years post onset of PTLD were 44 percent and 64 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. On multivariate analysis, risk factors of graft loss were PTLD stage greater than I to II and calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) withdrawal. Risk factors for graft loss and mortality were PTLD stage greater than I to II, CNI withdrawal, and age over 60 years. Type and location of PTLD, year of diagnosis, and chemotherapy regimen were not independent risk factors. Multivariate analysis determined CNI withdrawal as the most important risk factor for graft loss (HR = 3.07, CI 95% 1.04-9.09) and death (HR: 4.00, CI 95% 1.77-9.04). While long-term stable renal function after definitive CNI withdrawal for PTLD has been reported, this study suggests that withdrawal is associated with reduced graft and patient survival.</p><p/><p>The optimal reduction of immunosuppression regimen to ensure regression of disease is unknown.

The regimen adopted is based upon the severity of the disease in combination with the health risk associated with the possible loss of the allograft. Immunosuppression should be reduced to the lowest tolerated level. Often a reduction to 25 to 50 percent of baseline is used if alternative organ support is available (eg, renal or <span class=\"nowrap\">renal/pancreas</span> transplant). For heart and lung transplants, a maximum reduction of 50 to 75 percent of baseline is advised. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260803914\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymorphic PTLD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymorphic PTLD are polyclonal or monoclonal lymphoid infiltrates that demonstrate evidence of malignant transformation but do not meet all of the criteria for one of the B cell or <span class=\"nowrap\">T/NK</span> cell lymphomas recognized in immunocompetent patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Surgery may be considered, in addition, for a subset of patients with localized disease.</p><p>There is a paucity of data regarding the efficacy of different treatment options in this patient population. Most information comes from retrospective or prospective observational studies that combined polymorphic and monomorphic PTLD cases. These are described in the subsequent sections. The preference for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> therapy rather than combined rituximab plus chemotherapy in this patient population places a high value on avoiding toxicities associated with chemotherapy with the understanding that polymorphic PTLD is expected to be less clinically aggressive than monomorphic PTLD.

The first step in the management of patients with monomorphic PTLD is reduced immunosuppression as described above. However, only a small minority of cases will respond to reduction of immunosuppression alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Patients who are not candidates for reduction of immunosuppression and those who do not have a complete response to this intervention have been treated with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and occasionally surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/18,23,24,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23,24,29,30</a>]. There are no randomized trials comparing these treatment options. Instead, data largely come from expert opinion, retrospective analyses and uncontrolled prospective trials. Our approach is similar to that proposed by various consensus guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/18,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,31,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Reduction in immunosuppression'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with monomorphic PTLD that expresses CD20 (CD20+ PTLD), we suggest the use of reduction of immunosuppression plus the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Single agent rituximab may be considered for patients who have minimal symptoms and for those who are not candidates for initial chemotherapy (eg, poor performance status). All other patients with CD20+ PTLD are offered rituximab plus combination chemotherapy (eg, CHOP), administered concurrently or sequentially. Patients whose tumors do not express CD20 are not candidates for rituximab therapy and are treated with combination chemotherapy plus reduction of immunosuppression alone.</p><p>The optimal method for withdrawal of immunosuppression in this setting is unknown and different regimens have been tried. As described above, the choice for a particular patient must take into account the severity of disease in combination with the health risk associated with allograft loss. Except in the setting of follicular lymphoma, our practice is to discontinue the calcineurin inhibitor and the anti-metabolite, continue low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/d</span> and initiate chemotherapy. After completion of chemotherapy, we usually restart an mTOR inhibitor. If the mTOR is not tolerated, we begin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>. We have had excellent results with this approach. In our experience, the early aggressive near complete discontinuation of immunosuppression seems to allow for full dose chemotherapy, which is tolerated better.</p><p>Studies that have evaluated these approaches are described in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Rituximab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the ideal treatment of CD20+ PTLD is not known, most clinicians suggest the incorporation of immunotherapy directed against the CD20 antigen.

Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) have become a key component to the treatment of other CD20 positive non-Hodgkin lymphomas, such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, based upon a demonstrated survival benefit.

The major toxicities of rituximab include infusion reactions (ie, fevers, rigors, and hypotension) and infections related to immunosuppression. Rituximab also imposes a risk of hepatitis B reactivation among patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc).

The pathogenesis of PTLD in most patients relates to the outgrowth of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B cell proliferations in the setting of chronic T cell immunosuppression. However, EBV-negative tumors and T cell tumors can also occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevention of PTLD largely relies upon limiting patient exposure to aggressive immunosuppressive regimens, aggressive withdrawal and tapering of agents required for graft acceptance, and anti-viral prophylaxis. Many transplant centers have incorporated EBV monitoring into the routine evaluation of patients at high risk for PTLD and preemptive treatment of PTLD at the time of viral reactivation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or reduced immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of PTLD has varied significantly according to the type of lymphoproliferative disease present, as well as from institution to institution. Immunosuppression reduction is the cornerstone of therapy.&nbsp;Additional therapies include immunotherapy with the CD20 monoclonal antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. Other treatments, such as adoptive immunotherapy with EBV specific cytotoxic T cells, are generally reserved for persistent disease despite initial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our initial management is largely dependent upon the type of PTLD:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Early lesions &ndash; For most patients with early lesions, we suggest reduction of immunosuppression alone rather than in combination with other therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Other agents are generally reserved for those patients with residual disease despite reduced immunosuppression or for those who cannot tolerate reduction of immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Early lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Polymorphic PTLD &ndash; For most patients with polymorphic PTLD that expresses CD20 (CD20+ PTLD), we suggest the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in addition to reduction of immunosuppression, as tolerated, rather than reduction of immunosuppression alone or this combination with chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H260803914\" class=\"local\">'Polymorphic PTLD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Monomorphic PTLD &ndash; For patients with monomorphic CD20+ PTLD, we suggest the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy in addition to reduction of immunosuppression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Single agent rituximab may be considered for patients who have minimal symptoms and for those who are not candidates for initial chemotherapy. All other patients with CD20+ PTLD are offered rituximab plus combination chemotherapy, administered concurrently or sequentially. Patients whose tumors do not express CD20 are not candidates for rituximab therapy and are treated with combination chemotherapy plus reduction of immunosuppression. Surgery is reserved for patients with complications such as perforation or obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Monomorphic PTLD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Classical Hodgkin lymphoma-like PTLD &ndash; Classical Hodgkin lymphoma-like PTLD is the least common form of PTLD and there is a paucity of data regarding management. For most patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma-like PTLD we suggest management with chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy according to protocols used for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a paucity of information concerning mortality of patients with PTLD. Although the prognosis varies with clonality and extent of disease, published series suggest overall survival rates ranging between 25 to 35 percent. Mortality with monomorphic PTLD and T cell PTLD are higher.
