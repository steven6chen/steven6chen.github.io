Initial antimicrobial therapy should provide broad spectrum coverage tailored to host factors, such as age and underlying medical conditions, and be administered as soon as possible after presentation at doses that appropriate for patients with life-threatening infections (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour#H9034264\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic shock in children: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)&quot;, section on 'Empiric antibiotic therapy'</a>).

Gram stain of suspicious fluids may give early clues to the etiology of infection while cultures are incubating. In addition to cultures of specific sites, aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures should be drawn.

As an example, in one case series of 48 children who remained in septic shock despite at least 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of fluid, 33 percent had persistent hypovolemia and 40 percent had myocardial dysfunction. Serial monitoring detected clinically important changes, including late development of myocardial dysfunction that allowed for more refined titration of fluids, inotropes, and vasopressors over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-ongoing-management-after-resuscitation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In addition, the clinician should determine the need for invasive monitoring via intraarterial and central venous cannulas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intraarterial cannula placement</strong> &ndash; Noninvasive blood pressure measurement is acceptable in patients who have markedly improved or had total reversal of septic shock. Efforts to obtain intraarterial access should <strong>not</strong> interfere with the resuscitation of septic shock. However, automated blood pressures overestimate systolic blood pressure relative to intraarterial or Doppler ultrasound measurements in hypotensive children and underestimate systolic blood pressure among hypertension patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-ongoing-management-after-resuscitation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, insertion of an intraarterial catheter is suggested if blood pressure is labile or if restoration of arterial perfusion pressures is expected to be a protracted process. Procedures for obtaining intraarterial access in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arterial-puncture-and-cannulation-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arterial puncture and cannulation in children&quot;, section on 'Arterial cannulation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central venous access</strong> &ndash; Central venous access is indicated for patients with catecholamine-resistant septic shock because these patients frequently are dependent upon uninterrupted vasoactive medication administration to prevent further decompensation. If they also have poor perfusion, then they are at a greatly increased risk of extravasation and significant local tissue damage from peripherally administered vasoactive medications. Furthermore, central venous access permits monitoring of central venous pressures (CVPs) and ScvO<sub>2</sub> in these unstable patients and helps guide ongoing therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Central venous access is also appropriate in patients who have reversal of shock after initiation of vasoactive drugs, although patients who rapidly improve after receiving vasoactive medications and in whom a rapid weaning of support is expected, may not require central venous line placement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the absence of an elevated intraabdominal pressure, the correlation between femoral vein pressure and CVP is good, though absolute values may differ slightly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-ongoing-management-after-resuscitation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Changes in ScvO<sub>2</sub>, which provides reliable information regarding tissue oxygenation should also be frequently monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-ongoing-management-after-resuscitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If direct measure of ScvO<sub>2</sub> is not available, limited evidence suggests that a capillary refill time &le;2 seconds is associated with a ScvO<sub>2</sub> &ge;70 percent. However, capillary refill time can be brisk despite significant hemodynamic derangement in children with septic shock.

In patients with persistent poor perfusion or hypotension, boluses of fluids should continue until hemodynamic improvement is noted or evidence of cardiac insufficiency (eg, pulmonary edema, enlarged heart) occurs. Serial bedside cardiac ultrasound or echocardiography can also help to identify patients who remain hypovolemic. The volume per bolus and types of fluid are as for the resuscitation period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F113240\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113240 \">algorithm 1</a>). Fluid input and output should be carefully monitored on an hourly basis.

Observational studies in critically ill children, including children with sepsis who received renal replacement therapies, indicate that more than 10 percent fluid overload is associated with mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-ongoing-management-after-resuscitation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, the evidence is not sufficient to determine whether or not fluid overload has an independent deleterious effect on survival. Nonsurvivors may have had more severe septic shock and therefore, required greater amount of fluid and were more likely to develop renal insufficiency.</p><p>Patients with septic shock in whom urine output remains insufficient may warrant renal replacement therapy (RRT, eg, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis). The decision to initiate RRT should be made in collaboration with a pediatric nephrologist, whenever available. The indications and timing of RRT for fluid overload and modality choice in children are discussed separately.

In patients with clinical findings of significant fluid overload (eg, pitting edema, anasarca, or pulmonary edema), early initiation of diuretic therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a>) may be appropriate <strong>after</strong> a period of 12 to 24 hours of sustained hemodynamic stability off vasoactive infusions in patients with hypoxia and pulmonary edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18270354\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoglobin is the primary determinant of blood oxygen carrying capacity and, therefore, of tissue oxygen delivery. Thus, maintaining adequate hemoglobin levels is a critical aspect of managing children with ongoing septic shock. In hemodynamically unstable children with septic shock (eg, profound hypotension despite high levels of vasopressor support or profound hypoxia), we and the American College of Critical Care Medicine suggest a hemoglobin goal of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (equivalent to 30 percent hematocrit) as a target to maintain with blood transfusion for persistent malperfusion until further data are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-ongoing-management-after-resuscitation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Evidence is lacking to support the safety of tolerating a lower hemoglobin in pediatric patients, though there is evidence in adult sepsis that a lower hemoglobin target may be safe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult#H430736268\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;, section on 'Intensive care unit/septic shock'</a>.) </p><p>In stable patients recovering from septic shock, we typically use a hemoglobin of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> instead of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> as the threshold for blood transfusion. Limited evidence suggests that this lower hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion is likely to be safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-ongoing-management-after-resuscitation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As an example, in a multicenter unblinded trial of 137 children with sepsis who were hemodynamically stable (mean systemic arterial pressure was not below two standard deviations of normal for age and cardiovascular support was not increased for at least two hours before enrollment) that compared restrictive transfusion (transfusion for hemoglobin &lt;7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> with liberal transfusion (transfusion for hemoglobin &lt;9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> no clinically significant differences were found for the occurrence of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (18.8 versus 19.1 percent), PICU length of stay (13 days in both groups), or PICU mortality (7 versus 3 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-ongoing-management-after-resuscitation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Nevertheless, the use of these agents seems rational in patients with significant bleeding (melena, or prolonged bleeding from venipuncture sites) due to thrombocytopenia and clotting factor consumption or significant risk of bleeding (eg, pre- or postoperative patients).

FFP provides both procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins and is administered every 12 to 24 hours at a dose of 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per infusion. Cryoprecipitate has higher concentrations of factor VIII and fibrinogen, and can be used to correct hypofibrinogenemia.

Using this definition, one multicenter study showed that 30 percent of 381 critically ill children met criteria for AI during the first day of intensive care with a similar frequency occurring in the 59 patients with sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-ongoing-management-after-resuscitation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In addition, the practical limitations of inserting a large catheter for plasma exchange in young children (often with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and increased risk of bleeding), the intensive resources necessary to perform plasma exchange or plasmapheresis, and the potential to worsen hypotension in hemodynamically unstable patients have limited this therapy in pediatric sepsis. Decisions regarding the use of TPE in children with septic shock should be made in collaboration with a pediatric hematologist or transfusion medicine specialist.

In this study, low levels of the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease, ADAMTS-13, activity were reversed with daily plasma exchange, which the authors suggested as the potential benefit of this therapy.

Source control (physical measures undertaken to eradicate a focus of infection, to eliminate ongoing microbial contamination, and to render a site inhospitable to microbial growth and invasion) should be undertaken whenever possible because localized foci of infection (ie, abscess) may not respond to antibiotics alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59769\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59769 \">table 2</a>).
