When tested in young adults, consuming a single can over two hours can raise the blood alcohol level above 0.08 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. There are no reports on the hematologic consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Additional information about alcohol use disorder and risky drinking, including amount of alcohol and other features, are presented separately.

How this occurs is not completely understood. A direct toxic effect on hematopoietic cells, abnormalities in membrane phospholipids, and interference with folate utilization all may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The adverse effects of alcohol on hematopoiesis may be mediated in part by metabolites of alcohol (ethanol). Ingested ethanol is metabolized in the liver in part by alcohol dehydrogenase, which oxidizes alcohol to acetaldehyde while reducing NAD to NADH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Alcohol metabolism'</a>.)</p><p>It has been suggested that acetaldehyde accounts for some of the hematologic toxicity of alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Acetaldehyde can produce RBC protein-acetaldehyde adducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], which may generate immune responses against these modified proteins. Indeed, IgA and IgM anti-acetaldehyde-protein adducts have been found in alcoholics with macrocytic red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Macrocytosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MANIFESTATIONS OF HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of alcohol-induced hematologic disorders are profoundly influenced by the patient's access to medical care, and the presence or absence of other factors such nutritional deficiency or alcoholic cirrhosis. Most of these changes result, either directly or indirectly, in anemia. As an example, if extensive liver disease is present, the patient may develop an abnormally functioning fibrinogen or other coagulation disorders, which may initiate or exacerbate bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-fibrinogen#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of fibrinogen&quot;, section on 'Liver disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excess alcohol use, coupled with the patient's nutritional status, comorbidities, and access to care, can lead to anemia via the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient also has a chronic infection (eg, tuberculosis, chronic leg ulcers), the anemia of chronic disease may be present (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;</a>). Treatment of the underlying infection(s) will reverse this component of the patient's anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of cirrhosis can lead to bleeding from esophageal and gastric varices; bleeding can also occur from alcoholic gastritis. Continued bleeding may eventually lead to iron deficiency anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of portal hypertension may lead to congestive splenomegaly (hypersplenism), with splenic trapping of red cells, white cells, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> platelets and resulting cytopenia(s). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorpuscular non-immune hemolytic anemia: Fragmentation hemolysis and hypersplenism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding (eg, variceal bleeding, gastritis), which in turn may lead to the development of iron deficiency. This may be exacerbated by an acquired coagulopathy if liver disease is severe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excess alcohol use is probably the most common cause of nutritional folate deficiency in the United States, leading to a megaloblastic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. However, folate deficiency is vanishing in many countries that use routine folate supplementation of foods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Alcohol directly interferes with erythropoiesis and blocks the response to folate in subjects who are folate deficient. Both macrocytosis (see below) and stomatocytosis are regular features on the peripheral blood smear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Macrocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even before anemia appears, approximately 90 percent of alcoholics have a macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] between 100 to 110 femtoliters [fL]) which is easily detected by automated counters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/2,6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,9</a>]. Alcohol-induced macrocytosis occurs even though patients are folate and cobalamin replete and do not have liver disease. The mechanism is unknown, but it takes two to four months for the macrocytosis to disappear after the patient becomes abstinent.</p><p>Attribution of macrocytosis to alcohol use requires the exclusion of other causes of this abnormality. The most common are megaloblastic anemia (eg, B12 or folate deficiency), liver disease, hypothyroidism, use of antimetabolite drugs, and myelodysplastic syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66772\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66772 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>As an example, in a study of 300 patients in a New York City hospital who had a MCV &gt;100 fL, the most common causes were drugs (frequently for treatment of HIV) and alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Less common causes were liver disease and elevated reticulocytes. Megaloblastic anemia accounted for less than 10 percent of cases.</p><p>Alcoholism can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from megaloblastic anemia due to cobalamin deficiency or folate deficiency, although folate deficiency is increasingly rare. The latter diagnoses are suggested by the findings of an MCV above 110 fL, macroovalocytosis of the circulating red cells, teardrop-shaped red cells, and hypersegmented neutrophils on the blood smear (ie, more than 5 percent of neutrophils having five lobes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74901%7EHEME%2F58820\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74901 graphicRef58820 \">picture 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Measurement of the serum cobalamin level and red blood cell folate levels will usually establish the appropriate diagnosis. Measurement of serum folate is not used in this setting, since alcohol lowers the folate level even in patients who are not truly deficient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of alcohol-induced macrocytosis, with or without anemia, is abstinence. Return of the MCV to normal also confirms the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased red cell production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, anemia in alcoholic patients is often multifactorial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition to the direct toxic effect of alcohol, iron deficiency due to gastrointestinal bleeding, nutritional folate deficiency from the effects of a poor diet, and the anemia of chronic disease may be present. Each of these disorders impairs RBC production, which should be associated with a low or low normal reticulocyte count. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-adults-due-to-decreased-red-blood-cell-production\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in adults due to decreased red blood cell production&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although decreased red cell production is generally responsible for the anemia, there may also be a hemolytic component in some alcoholic patients. Two factors may contribute to this problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenic sequestration due to an enlarged spleen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorpuscular non-immune hemolytic anemia: Fragmentation hemolysis and hypersplenism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spur cell hemolysis in severe alcoholic cirrhosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-immune hemolytic anemia due to systemic disease&quot;</a>). In an interesting case report, orthotopic liver transplant cured the spur cell anemia, which recurred when the patient resumed alcohol intake and the liver graft failed, implicating both liver failure and excess alcohol use as causes of spur cell anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are usually unnecessary in the anemia associated with alcohol use. If obtained, approximately one-fourth of patients will show the presence of ringed sideroblasts in erythroid precursors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65887\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65887 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Very heavy alcohol consumption may also be associated with the appearance of vacuoles in proerythroblasts and granulocytic precursors, the cause of which is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As an example, in a series of 144 patients from Finland, 24 percent of severe alcohol users had vacuolated proerythroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The marrow may also become distinctly hypoplastic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and very rarely even aplastic with pancytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Abstinence results in reversal of the hypoplasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LEUKOPENIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcoholics appear to be immunocompromised and are susceptible to recurrent infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Leukopenia, due to a fall in the neutrophil count, occurs in approximately 8 percent of hospitalized alcoholics, and there may also be a hard-to-characterize defect in neutrophil function. The presence of alcoholic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and splenomegaly can further lower the white blood cell count (ie, hypersplenism).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">THROMBOCYTOPENIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some series, as many as 80 percent of hospitalized alcoholics have mild thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count below <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An enlarged spleen in the patient with alcoholic cirrhosis is thought to play an important role, but alcohol also has a direct toxic effect on megakaryocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The platelet count rarely falls below <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL;</span> as a result, splenectomy to control thrombocytopenic bleeding is almost never necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In some patients, platelet function may also be abnormal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired disorders of platelet function&quot;, section on 'Liver disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Rebound thrombocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The combination of alcohol abstinence and ingestion of a reasonable diet (typically occurring after hospitalization) often results in a platelet &quot;rebound&quot; at one to two weeks, with the platelet count often reaching 600,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">900,000/microL</span>. This is a normal and transient response to the prior episode of thrombocytopenia, and does not require hematologic consultation or treatment. The platelet count returns to normal levels within another 7 to 10 days without further therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1411129\"><span class=\"h1\">IRON OVERLOAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the mechanism(s) involved are unclear, excess ingestion of alcohol leads to increased absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract, with deposition in the liver. The resulting accumulation of iron can lead to oxidative damage, cell death, fibrogenesis, and such complications as fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and an increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-complications-of-alcohol-use/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Determination of hepatic iron via quantitative phlebotomy, liver biopsy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> use of noninvasive T2* MRI techniques indicates that, although increased, hepatic iron levels in those with alcoholic liver disease are significantly lower than that seen in patients with HH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1411208\"><span class=\"h2\">Interaction with existing genetic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excess alcohol intake, with or without hepatic iron accumulation, is a risk factor for the worsening of a number of genetic disorders, such as the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hereditary hemochromatosis</strong> &mdash; The increased iron absorption associated with excess alcohol ingestion is an additive risk factor for hepatic iron overload in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, especially those with underlying liver disease.
