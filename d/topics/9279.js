A study using blinded raters found a positive family history of intermittent explosive disorder in more first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, or offspring) of patients with the disorder (n = 32) than in relatives of nonaggressive controls (n = 32) (34 versus 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, twin and family studies suggest that 44 to 72 percent of the likelihood of developing impulsive aggressive behavior is genetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This is consistent with a meta-analysis of 24 twin and adoption studies of aggression (number of subjects not specified), which found that genetic factors accounted for roughly 50 percent of the variance in aggression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H870267523\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurobiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that brain structure and function are altered in intermittent explosive disorder. As an example, structural, functional, and connectivity brain magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that the amygdala, which is involved in emotional functioning, is affected.

Support for this hypothesis includes a functional magnetic resonance imaging study that presented photographs of angry faces to 10 patients with intermittent explosive disorder and 10 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].
