Groin hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed operations. Over 20 million inguinal or femoral hernias are repaired every year worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], including over 700,000 in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>An inguinal or femoral hernia repair is performed urgently in patients who develop complications such as acute incarceration or strangulation. For patients without a complication, the optimal timing of repair (watchful waiting versus early repair) and the optimal surgical technique (open versus laparoscopic) are controversial and are the focus of this topic. </p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of an inguinal or femoral hernia, the technical details of performing an inguinal or femoral hernia repair, the complications of hernia repair, and the treatment of recurrent hernias are discussed separately in other topics.

Contemporary practice, however, triages patients to surgery versus watchful waiting according to the severity of symptoms and the type of hernia (inguinal versus femoral).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387852146\"><span class=\"h2\">Complicated hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who develop strangulation or bowel obstruction should undergo urgent surgical repair. Surgery performed within four to six hours from the onset of symptoms may prevent bowel loss due to one of these complications.</p><p>Patients with an acutely incarcerated inguinal hernia but without signs of strangulation (eg, skin changes, peritonitis) should be offered urgent surgical repair. However, hernia reduction can be attempted in patients who wish to delay surgery. If hernia reduction is successful, the patient should follow up with their surgeon within one to two days to exclude recurrent incarceration and arrange for elective repair. Those who fail hernia reduction should proceed urgently to surgery. </p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">incarcerated/strangulated</span> inguinal or femoral hernias can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1357306694\"><span class=\"h2\">Uncomplicated hernias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with uncomplicated inguinal or femoral hernias, surgical repair is intended to relieve symptoms and to prevent future complications. The indications for surgical repair of uncomplicated hernias are less rigid than complicated hernias, and depend upon the type of hernias (inguinal versus femoral) involved, the severity of symptoms, and patient preference. In select patients, watchful waiting is an alternative to surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1170131796\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic hernia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1522671966\"><span class=\"h3\">Femoral hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all patients with a newly diagnosed femoral hernia, we suggest elective surgical repair, rather than watchful waiting, regardless of the patient&rsquo;s sex and symptoms. Femoral hernias are associated with a high risk of complications and therefore early elective surgical repair is indicated.</p><p>Femoral hernias are associated with a higher risk of developing complications than inguinal hernias. In one study, the rates of strangulation were 22 and 45 percent at 3 and 21 months, respectively, for femoral hernias, compared with 2.8 and 4.5 percent for inguinal hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Thus, early elective repair is advised for patients with a newly diagnosed femoral hernia to avoid complications that may necessitate urgent surgery. Urgent surgery for complicated hernias is more likely to involve bowel resection, which is associated with a higher mortality rate. In one study, for example, bowel resection was required in 23 percent of urgent, compared with 0.6 percent of elective femoral hernia repairs, and urgent femoral hernia repairs were associated with a 10-fold increase in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>For patients who have a long-standing (&gt;3 months) femoral hernia that is asymptomatic, surgery is preferred but observation is a reasonable option. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2150320565\"><span class=\"h3\">Inguinal hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with moderate to severe symptoms from an inguinal hernia, surgical repair is indicated. Patients with minimal or no symptoms from an inguinal hernia may be managed with elective surgery or watchful waiting.</p><p>The only nonsurgical therapy for groin hernia in men is a truss. A truss is a strap similar to an athletic supporter with a metal or hard plastic plug positioned to lie over the hernia defect. When applied appropriately, the hard disc or plug exerts pressure to keep the hernia contents in the abdomen. Although the use of a truss may be helpful in certain situations, we generally discourage their use because there is insufficient evidence to prove their efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In addition, inappropriate use of a truss may harm abdominal contents in a hernia sac or complicate subsequent surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3366855915\"><span class=\"h4\">Symptomatic hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with significant symptoms attributable to an inguinal hernia should undergo elective surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Such symptoms typically include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Groin pain with exertion (eg, lifting)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to perform daily activities due to pain or discomfort from the hernia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to manually reduce the hernia (ie, chronic incarceration)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1170131796\"><span class=\"h4\">Asymptomatic hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with minimal or no symptoms from an inguinal hernia, we suggest elective hernia repair. However, those who wish to avoid surgery can be managed with watchful waiting provided that they know to seek immediate medical attention if the hernia becomes acutely incarcerated. (See <a href=\"#H387852146\" class=\"local\">'Complicated hernia'</a> above.)</p><p>Historically, groin hernias were repaired once detected, under the assumption that complications from unrepaired hernias were common and could increase operative morbidity. Randomized trials comparing watchful waiting with surgical repair of inguinal hernias, however, demonstrated that delaying surgical repair in asymptomatic patients was safe, as acute complications rarely occurred. However, for about half of patients, surgical repair was required eventually because symptoms gradually increased over time.</p><p>The largest trial (the WW trial) randomly assigned 720 men with an uncomplicated inguinal hernia to watchful waiting or open surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The patients, who were men mostly between the ages of 40 and 65, were asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, and the hernias remained easily reducible within six weeks of the initial screening. The following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At two years, similar numbers of patients in each group reported pain sufficient to limit activities (5.1 with watchful waiting versus 2.1 percent with surgery). Although 23 and 31 percent of patients in the watchful waiting group required surgery at two and four years, respectively, only two patients required urgent surgery due to acute complications, at a rate of 0.0018 events per patient-year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After an additional seven years of follow-up, a total of 68 percent of men in the watchful waiting group had surgery, most commonly for pain (54 percent). Men older than 65 years were more likely to require surgery than younger men (79 versus 62 percent). However, only one additional patient required urgent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>A subsequent trial of 160 men also found no differences in either the rate of hernia complications or pain scores between the surgery and watchful waiting groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, at six and twelve months, patients in the surgery group reported improvement in their general health, whereas patients in the watchful waiting group reported a decline. At 15 months, 26 percent of men in the watchful waiting group required surgery, including three urgent operations. </p><p>We suggest that patients with inguinal hernias that are managed with watchful waiting be counseled that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the risks of hernia complications (eg, incarceration, strangulation, or bowel obstruction) are low (&lt;1 percent), patients should seek immediate medical attention if their hernia becomes incarcerated, or if other signs and symptoms of complications become present. (See <a href=\"#H387852146\" class=\"local\">'Complicated hernia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-quarter of patients who initially opt for watchful waiting will eventually require surgical repair within four to five years due to increasing symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who opt for watchful waiting should seek prompt surgical evaluation if they experience discomfort with certain physical activities. Additionally, patients who routinely avoid certain activities out of concern for hernia-related pain should also seek surgical evaluation, particularly if the activities they avoid are beneficial to their overall health (eg, cardiovascular or aerobic exercises).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2839569884\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS TO SURGICAL REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inguinal or femoral hernia repair can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality in almost all patients, including those who are older <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have medical comorbidities (eg, advanced liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]); most patients enjoy a rapid recovery to presurgical health shortly after surgery. Thus, there is no contraindication to urgent repair of complicated hernias. However, pregnant women should not have elective repair of an inguinal or femoral hernia until at least four weeks after delivery. </p><p>For patients who cannot tolerate general anesthesia, inguinal or femoral hernias can be repaired under local anesthesia using one of the open techniques. For patients with an active groin infection or systemic sepsis, mesh placement is contraindicated, but groin hernias can be repaired using non-mesh techniques when necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wound infection following repair of abdominal wall hernia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498461824\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of inguinal hernias during pregnancy is low and estimated to be 1:2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Elective repair of a groin hernia during pregnancy is generally contraindicated. Expectant management during the peripartum period has been associated with few serious hernia-related complications. In one study, seven women with groin hernias were managed nonoperatively, and each had their hernias repaired after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although combined cesarean delivery and hernia repair have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>], elective hernia repair should generally be deferred for at least four weeks postpartum to allow the lax abdominal wall to return to its baseline. </p><p>Urgent hernia repair during pregnancy may be required if the patient develops severe discomfort or one of the complications, such as acute incarceration, strangulation, or bowel obstruction. In one study, such complications were rare and only accounted for &lt;5 percent of intestinal obstructions observed during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1405881718\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING A SURGICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While all surgeons perform open groin hernia repairs, some also perform laparoscopic repairs. In general, surgeons should choose the approach with which they are most comfortable and most experienced. For surgeons who are equally facile with both repairs, the choice of a surgical approach depends upon hernia and patient characteristics. The process described below and outlined in the accompanying algorithm reflects the author&rsquo;s preference and should not be regarded as the only approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107556\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107556 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H579416172\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients precluded from laparoscopic repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While open repair of an inguinal or femoral hernia is feasible in almost all patients, laparoscopic repair cannot be safely performed in certain patients due to patient or technical reasons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1483892862\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with prior surgery involving the preperitoneal space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic repair, especially with the totally extraperitoneal (TEP) technique, requires the development and maintenance of the preperitoneal space. Adhesions formed after previous surgery, incision, or mesh placement could render that space inaccessible. </p><p>Thus, we perform an open hernia repair for patients who have had one or more previous surgeries involving the preperitoneal space (eg, prostatectomy, hysterectomy, cesarean section, or laparotomy via lower midline incision). Although laparoscopic surgery is feasible in such patients (especially with the transabdominal preperitoneal patch [TAPP] technique), it is technically challenging, requires a longer operative time, and is associated more complications than open surgery in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345988931\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with complicated hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We repair all incarcerated or strangulated groin hernias with an open approach to minimize the risk of bowel injury. A laparoscopic approach is theoretically possible but difficult to perform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. </p><p>Furthermore, in cases where bowel perforation has occurred due to bowel ischemia or necrosis, the placement of mesh is contraindicated, thereby precluding a laparoscopic repair. Open repair can be performed with or without mesh, and therefore is the preferred treatment for complicated hernias in which the risk of active infection or contamination (from perforation) is high. (See <a href=\"#H3175286276\" class=\"local\">'Open techniques'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wound infection following repair of abdominal wall hernia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We also prefer to repair large scrotal hernias (&gt;3 cm) with an open approach because of the technical difficulty associated with managing and reducing a large hernia sac laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2589950024\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with ascites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with ascites, we prefer an open approach to laparoscopic approaches. In particular, the laparoscopic TAPP approach (which is transperitoneal) should be avoided. Prior to surgery, ascites should be minimized as much as possible with medical treatment. At the time of surgery, the hernia sac should be left intact to avoid complications such as persistent leakage of ascitic fluid.

Thus, patients who cannot tolerate general anesthesia for medical reasons should undergo open repair under local or regional anesthesia.

Some surgeons prefer to repair a primary, unilateral inguinal hernia with an open technique, while others prefer a laparoscopic approach. (See <a href=\"#H2714765031\" class=\"local\">'Open tension-free mesh repairs'</a> below.) </p><p>Open and laparoscopic approaches have been directly compared most often in inguinal hernia repairs. In general, laparoscopic repair has been associated with less postoperative pain and quicker recovery, but longer operative time and higher recurrence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/21,27-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27-39</a>]. Laparoscopic repair could also result in serious complications (eg, massive pelvic bleeding) that would rarely occur during open repairs. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest trial randomly assigned 1983 men with inguinal hernias to receive open or laparoscopic mesh repair at 1 of 14 United States Veterans Affairs Medical Centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Patients treated laparoscopically had less pain on the day of surgery and at two weeks, and returned to work one day earlier. However, they suffered more postoperative complications (39 versus 33.4 percent), life-threatening complications (1.1 versus 0.1 percent), and hernia recurrences (10.1 versus 4.9 percent at two years). In subgroup analysis, the difference in recurrence rate was significant for primary (10.1 versus 4 percent), but not recurrent hernias (10 versus 14 percent). This trial has been criticized for higher than average rates of recurrences in both groups due to surgeon inexperience, as well as for a patient population that is older (average age 58) and less healthy (only 34 percent were American Society of Anesthesiologists class I) than the average patient who needs inguinal hernia repair. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent trial randomly assigned 389 patients with a primary unilateral inguinal hernia to receive either open Lichtenstein repair under local anesthesia or laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair under general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Fewer patients in the laparoscopic group reported having persistent groin pain at one year (21 versus 33 percent). However, this difference may not be clinically relevant, as most patients reported mild pain (described as &ldquo;can be easily ignored&rdquo; on the questionnaire); only a few patients in each group (2 percent in the laparoscopic versus 3 percent in open group) reported severe pain. In addition, fewer patients in the laparoscopic group reported having groin pain that limited their ability to perform physical exercise (3 versus 8 percent). The recurrence rates at one year were similarly low in both groups (1 percent laparoscopic versus 2 percent open).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Swedish prospective cohort study of over 20,000 patients undergoing elective unilateral groin hernia repair between 2012 and 2015 showed that groin pain interfering with daily activities persisted at one year after surgery in 15.2 percent of patients, higher than previously estimated. The risk of chronic pain was lower with TEP than with open anterior mesh (Lichtenstein) repair (adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96), but at the price of a higher risk of recurrence requiring reoperation (adjusted odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.52-2.98) at 2.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3702035378\"><span class=\"h5\">Femoral hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer to repair a femoral hernia laparoscopically because of its ease of access. Anterior femoral hernia repairs require a breach of the inguinal canal to gain access to the femoral hernia posteriorly; posterior repairs have direct access to the femoral hernia without going through the inguinal canal.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-herniorrhaphy groin pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of complications of inguinal and femoral hernia repair&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who develop strangulation or bowel obstruction from an inguinal or femoral hernia should undergo urgent surgical repair. Patients with an acutely incarcerated inguinal hernia but without signs of strangulation or obstruction also require surgery, typically urgently. However, for those who wish to delay surgery, nonsurgical hernia reduction can be attempted, and, if successful, elective hernia repair can be performed at a later time. (See <a href=\"#H387852146\" class=\"local\">'Complicated hernia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an uncomplicated inguinal or femoral hernia may undergo surgical repair or be managed with watchful waiting depending upon the hernia type, severity of symptoms, and the preference of the patient, as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with newly diagnosed femoral hernia, we recommend elective repair, rather than watchful waiting, regardless of symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In patients with long-standing femoral hernias (&gt;3 months), surgery is preferred but observation is a reasonable option. (See <a href=\"#H1522671966\" class=\"local\">'Femoral hernia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with moderate or severe symptoms attributable to an inguinal hernia, we recommend elective repair rather than watchful waiting (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3366855915\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic hernia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who have an inguinal hernia but minimal or no symptoms, who wish to avoid surgery, can be managed with watchful waiting provided that they are appropriately counseled to seek prompt medical attention should the hernia become acutely incarcerated. Trusses are associated with negative consequences and should not be used to manage symptoms related to inguinal hernias. (See <a href=\"#H1170131796\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic hernia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The surgical approach to groin hernia repair should be the one that the surgeon is most comfortable with and most experienced in performing. For surgeons who are equally facile with both open and laparoscopic repairs, the choice of a surgical approach depends upon hernia and patient characteristics as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107556\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107556 \">algorithm 1</a>): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We prefer an open approach for patients with prior surgery involving the preperitoneal space (including laparoscopic groin hernia repair, prostatectomy, hysterectomy, cesarean section, and laparotomy via lower midline incision), complicated inguinal hernias (infected, incarcerated, strangulated, large scrotal), ascites, or intolerance of general anesthesia. Laparoscopic repair is relatively contraindicated in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H579416172\" class=\"local\">'Patients precluded from laparoscopic repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A primary, unilateral inguinal hernia can be repaired open or laparoscopically based upon surgeon and patient preferences. (See <a href=\"#H682635529\" class=\"local\">'Inguinal hernia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We prefer to repair a femoral hernia laparoscopically. (See <a href=\"#H3702035378\" class=\"local\">'Femoral hernia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We prefer to repair bilateral inguinal or femoral hernias laparoscopically. (See <a href=\"#H1746763040\" class=\"local\">'Bilateral hernias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We prefer to repair a recurrent groin hernia with a laparoscopic approach if the initial repair was open, but with an open approach if the initial repair was laparoscopic. (See <a href=\"#H1604226323\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent hernia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with uncomplicated inguinal and femoral hernias, we recommend performing a tension-free repair, which typically requires the use of mesh, rather than a repair that produces tension (ie, most nonmesh primary tissue approximation repairs except Shouldice) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Nonmesh repair techniques may be required for patients with active groin infection or contamination (eg, as a result of bowel perforation from a strangulated hernia), or when the use of a mesh is cost-prohibitive. (See <a href=\"#H744352\" class=\"local\">'Surgical techniques'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing elective inguinal or femoral hernia repair requiring mesh placement, we suggest using preoperative prophylactic antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1855762523\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prefer to perform open groin hernia repair under local anesthesia, especially in patients with comorbidities (eg, advanced liver disease). Most laparoscopic repairs require general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H3648445086\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthesia'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rosenberg J, Bisgaard T, Kehlet H, et al.
