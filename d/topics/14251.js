Autologous HCT recipients who have received or will receive immunosuppressive therapies increasing the risk for bacterial infections may also be given antibacterial prophylaxis.

The optimal duration of prophylaxis against <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and other encapsulated bacteria is not clear. We continue it for as long as the patient is receiving active immunosuppressive therapy (ie, treatment for GVHD), whereas some centers continue it for a longer period beyond cessation of active immunosuppressive therapy. Antibiotics with activity against encapsulated bacteria include penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>, but rates of resistance to these agents vary in different geographic regions.

The typical duration of PCP prophylaxis is six months in allogeneic HCT recipients but is longer in those requiring treatment for GVHD.

TMP-SMX also has activity against <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, <em>Nocardia</em> spp, <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>, and various respiratory and enteric pathogens.

The following measures should be used for room ventilation when protective isolation is indicated: &ge;12 air exchanges per hour, high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, directed airflow (so that air intake occurs at one side of the room and air exhaust occurs at the opposite side), positive air pressure differential between the patient's room and the hallway, well-sealed rooms, continuous pressure monitoring, and self-closing doors to maintain constant pressure differentials. The use of laminar airflow remains controversial because its possible benefit remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]; laminar airflow is not recommended for newly constructed patient rooms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Construction or renovation</strong> &ndash; If construction or renovation occurs, intensified mold control measures should be put into place to minimize fungal spore counts in patient rooms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cleaning</strong> &ndash; HCT units should be cleaned at least daily with special attention to dust control.

At a minimum, standard precautions should be used. Standard precautions include hand hygiene and appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, surgical masks or eye and face protection, and gowns) during procedures that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions, or cause soiling of clothing. We use gloves and masks during respiratory virus outbreaks and during respiratory virus season in an attempt to further reduce the risk of transmission of respiratory viruses from health care workers and visitors to HCT recipients. Some centers use gloves and masks year round.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most studies have failed to establish a clear benefit for masks in protecting either other patients or health care workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. However, two studies did show a reduction in respiratory virus infections among HCT recipients when masks were worn by all individuals who had direct contact with the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-infections-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When an HCT recipient is suspected of having or proven to have an infection requiring additional precautions (eg, airborne, droplet, or contact precautions), they should be implemented as indicated.

Hand hygiene involves the use of alcohol-based hand rubs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> handwashing with soap and water. In the absence of visible soiling of hands or contact with spore-forming organisms (eg, <em>Clostridium difficile</em>), the preferred method of hand hygiene is with an alcohol-based hand rub because of its superior microbicidal activity, reduced drying of the skin, and convenience. When hands are visibly dirty or when the patient has infection with a spore-forming organism, they should be washed thoroughly using soap and water.

(See <a href=\"#H1170632609\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of excessive immunosuppression and myelosuppression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for allogeneic HCT recipients who have received myeloablative conditioning regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Levofloxacin</a> (500 mg orally once daily) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (500 mg orally twice daily) have been studied most extensively, and levofloxacin is favored in patients with increased risk for oral mucositis-related <em>Streptococcus viridans</em> infection. Reduced-intensity and nonmyeloablative conditioning allogeneic HCT is generally associated with a short period of neutropenia and, therefore, there is typically no need for antibiotic prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis with a fluoroquinolone should be considered for autologous HCT patients transplanted for hematologic malignancies using conditioning regimens that cause significant mucosal injury or in patients who have received or will receive immunosuppressive therapies increasing the risk for bacterial infections. The decision of whether to give antibacterial prophylaxis to autologous HCT recipients should be made on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H855870674\" class=\"local\">'Before engraftment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylaxis-of-infection-during-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia-in-high-risk-adults#H875811271\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylaxis of infection during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in high-risk adults&quot;, section on 'Antibacterial prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For HCT recipients with chronic GVHD, we suggest antibacterial prophylaxis with an agent active against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We continue it for as long as the patient is receiving active immunosuppressive therapy (ie, treatment for GVHD). The choice of antibacterial drug should be based upon local resistance patterns. In areas with a low rate of resistance to penicillin, we favor penicillin. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'After engraftment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For allogeneic HCT recipients, we recommend that prophylaxis against <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (formerly <em>P. carinii</em>) pneumonia (PCP) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) be started after engraftment and continued for as long as immunosuppressive therapy is given (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Pneumocystis prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We also recommend PCP prophylaxis for selected autologous HCT recipients, including those with underlying hematologic malignancies such as lymphoma, myeloma, or leukemia, those receiving myeloablative conditioning regimens, those with graft manipulations (eg, CD34 selection), and those who have recently received a purine analog (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cladribine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cladribine</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).
