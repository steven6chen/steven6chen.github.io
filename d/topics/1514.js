Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm improves symptoms and decreases the risk of embolization if atrial flutter recurrence does not occur.

In addition, the long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm may decrease the risk of stroke. Rhythm control with either radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drug therapy is necessary; in most cases, RF catheter ablation is preferred because of the high rate of success and low rate of complications. Exceptions include individuals identified as having reversible triggers such as pneumonia, hyperthyroidism, and other acute medical problems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy'</a>.). </p><p>Atrial flutter is characterized by rapid, regular atrial depolarizations at a characteristic rate of approximately 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. In the absence of rate slowing drugs or atrioventricular (AV) nodal disease, every other depolarization passes through the AV node, and the ventricular rate is usually around 150 beats per minute. Unlike AF, attempts to slow this rate are often unsuccessful or require high doses of rate slowing drugs; thus, the maintenance of sinus rhythm is desirable in most patients to control symptoms. In addition, episodes will often be recurrent unless a reversible cause is present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-atrial-and-atrioventricular-nodal-supraventricular-arrhythmias#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Atrial and atrioventricular nodal (supraventricular) arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial flutter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The discussion in this topic pertains primarily to patients with typical atrial flutter. The pathogenesis of typical atrial flutter makes it highly amendable to curative therapy with radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation, though atypical flutters may also be cured with RF ablation. Typical (also called isthmus-dependent) atrial flutter utilizes a large macroreentrant pathway in the right atrium, with the left atrium following passively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic features of atrial flutter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The negative deflection of the flutter (F) wave in lead II coincides in time with the impulse activating the low right atrial tissue between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve. Activation then travels anteriorly through the region of the low septum, and superiorly and anteriorly up the medial surface of the right atrium, returning along the lateral wall of the right atrium back to the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>].</p><p>The cavotricuspid isthmus between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus (IVC-TA isthmus) is an obligatory route for typical flutter, and, as such, is the best anatomic target for ablation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69946%7ECARD%2F60090\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef69946 graphicRef60090 \">waveform 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/2-5,7-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5,7-15</a>]. </p><p>From a practical point of view, we approach management of these patients in a manner similar to patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RF CATHETER ABLATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with typical atrial flutter in whom a decision is made to maintain sinus rhythm, radiofrequency catheter ablation is usually preferred to pharmacologic therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The femoral approach is generally used and, under fluoroscopic guidance or using a three-dimensional mapping system, an ablation catheter is placed at the CTI where a large ventricular and small atrial electrogram are recorded. RF energy is applied, and the catheter is slowly withdrawn to create a line of ablation from the annulus to the inferior vena cava. </p><p>The goal is to create a complete ablation line with the absence of electrical conduction across the CTI both medially to laterally and laterally to medially. This is the best marker for long-term success (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69946%7ECARD%2F60090\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef69946 graphicRef60090 \">waveform 1A-B</a>). If the patient presents in typical atrial flutter, CTI block should still be assessed with differential pacing on both sides of the ablation line after termination of atrial flutter, since frequently there can still be conduction across the CTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. An infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> during pacing may help to assess the completeness of isthmus block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> may also be given to assess for block across the line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Another method for ablation is the maximum voltage technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Coronary sinus (CS) ostial pacing is completed and the largest amplitude atrial signal in the CTI is ablated as a point lesion. The next largest signal is then targeted, and the process is repeated until block is seen across the isthmus. </p><p>Electroanatomic mapping is used in many cases for identifying the appropriate target area for ablation; it is a nonfluoroscopic three-dimensional mapping system. This system permits reconstruction of cardiac anatomy without the use of fluoroscopy. A study of 50 patients with atrial flutter compared isthmus ablation using conventional fluoroscopy for catheter positioning to positioning with electromagnetic mapping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The success rate for complete isthmus blockade after 20 RF pulses or 25 minutes of fluoroscopy time was greater with electromagnetic mapping (96 versus 67 percent). Electromagnetic mapping significantly reduced the overall fluoroscopic time (4 versus 22 minutes) and the fluoroscopic time needed for isthmus mapping (0.2 versus 17.7 minutes). </p><p>Ablation guided by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) can also be used, and may be helpful to assess for pouches and ridges in the CTI during difficult cases or repeat procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, in most cases, ICE is not of significant benefit for typical atrial flutter because the relevant anatomical structure in the right atrium can be readily identified without ICE during ablation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial success rate for RF catheter ablation of typical atrial flutter has ranged from 65 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. A meta-analysis of a 21 studies examining atrial flutter success rate suggested a single procedure success of 92 percent and multiple procedure success rate of 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent flutter or AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 7 and 44 percent of patients who undergo flutter ablation have recurrent atrial arrhythmia, though the recurrent arrhythmia is usually AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Thus, some patients should undergoing surveillance for recurrent atrial flutter or AF. Our approach to surveillance for recurrent arrhythmia is as follows. For patients who were initially symptomatic and who did not develop a tachycardia mediated cardiomyopathy, we perform testing to document recurrent arrhythmia only for symptoms. If the patient was initially asymptomatic, we perform periodic examinations (every 12 months) at which time we obtain an electrocardiogram or event recording. For those patients who developed tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy, standard heart failure therapy is still indicated with beta blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker unless otherwise contraindicated. Follow-up assessment of left ventricular function by imaging techniques such as echocardiography is warranted; we obtain a repeat echocardiogram three to six months after initiation of therapy. </p><p>The rate of recurrent AF appears to depend upon the presence or absence of AF before the procedure. In a study of 100 patients, 29 of whom had documented AF before the procedure, AF occurred in 36.4 percent of those with complete follow-up after a mean of almost 15 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, in another study of approximately 100 patients without pre-existent AF, new onset AF developed in only 12.9 percent during a mean follow-up of 19 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Most patients (92 percent) who develop AF after flutter ablation do so within six months. The risk may be as low as 10 percent (mean follow-up of 20 months) in those with no prior AF and a left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The likely reasons for the difference in the rates of recurrence likely has to do with differing populations being studied (eg, symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients) and the intensity of follow-up. &#160;</p><p>In a study of 363 patients who underwent RF ablation for typical atrial flutter, 82 percent developed drug refractory AF during a follow-up period of 39 <span class=\"nowrap\">(+/-</span> 11) months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Elimination of atrial flutter may delay, but does not prevent AF and the two may share common triggers. Therefore, patients may derive a better long-term benefit from additional anatomical ablative treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pharmacological therapy of AF. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Patients with atrial fibrillation'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Improvement in left ventricular function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent atrial flutter can result in a tachycardia-mediated left ventricular cardiomyopathy, similar to what has been seen with AF and other arrhythmias. On the other hand, reversal of the arrhythmia can result in improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction and, in 6 of 11 patients in one report, restoration of normal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Other benefits include a reduced frequency of hospitalizations, emergency department visits, need for cardioversion, and the need for antiarrhythmic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13092020\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RF catheter ablation of atrial flutter is significantly safer than that for atrial fibrillation, in part because the left atrium is not entered and because the procedure is generally shorter due to the fact that ablation in a very limited area that is not adjacent to vulnerable structures such as the esophagus and pulmonary veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The patients were assigned to conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy or catheter ablation as a first line treatment. After a mean follow-up of 21 months, the following significant benefits were noted in the patients undergoing ablation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More were in sinus rhythm (80 versus 36 percent with drugs; P&lt;0.01).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer required rehospitalization (22 versus 63 percent).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer developed AF (29 versus 53 percent).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sense of well-being and function during daily life activities improved with ablation but did not change with drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13091019\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with atrial flutter, pharmacologic therapy is not chosen for the long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm. The success rate at one year has been estimated at only 20 to 30 percent, with the risk of recurrence being highest in the patient with an enlarged right atrium who is in heart failure. Good prognostic signs for maintaining sinus rhythm are normal atrial size, recent onset, little or no heart failure, and an underlying reversible disorder such as hyperthyroidism, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism. For patients in whom an attempt will be made to maintain sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drug therapy, we use the following drugs (with suggested starting doses): <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a> 400 mg twice daily; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> 50 to 100 mg twice daily with an atrioventricular nodal agent; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> 80 mg twice daily; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a> 500 microgram twice daily; or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>. Our reviewers have differing preferences as to the order in which these are tried.</p><p>The drugs that are most likely to maintain sinus rhythm are the same as those used for rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83173\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef83173 \">algorithm 1</a>). They act by suppressing triggering beats and arrhythmias and affecting atrial electrophysiologic properties. In a meta-analysis that included 36 patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> was 50 percent effective in the maintenance of sinus rhythm over variable follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Flecainide can also slow down the atrial flutter rate; thus, atrioventricular (AV) nodal agents should always be used in conjunction to prevent one-to-one atrial flutter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations#H523850628\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation: Recommendations&quot;, section on 'Selecting an antiarrhythmic drug'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>, a class III antiarrhythmic drug available for use in the United States, may be more effective than other agents for maintaining sinus rhythm. In the SAFIRE-D trial, which included 48 patients with atrial flutter, the probability of maintaining sinus rhythm at one year with dofetilide at a dose of 125, 250, or 500 &micro;g twice daily was 0.49, 0.38, and 0.8 versus 0.59 for placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dronedarone</a> has been studied for the use of atrial flutter, though the major studies all included patients with AF also. In a trial of 2327 patients with AF or atrial flutter who were randomly assigned to either dronedarone 400 mg twice daily or placebo, dronedarone reduced the chances of recurrent AF or flutter by 25 percent and prolonged the time to first recurrence from 498 to 737 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In those with atrial flutter who had a recurrence, the mean heart rate was reduced by six <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min,</span> reflecting its rate control properties also. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with atrial flutter also have episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF). For many of these patients who have chosen ablation, we recommend atrial fibrillation (with or without atrial flutter ablation) ablation rather than atrial flutter ablation alone. The electrophysiologic substrates of AF and atrial flutter are different, and the addition of atrial flutter ablation to AF ablation adds very little risk. However, in some cases, we believe it is reasonable to perform atrial flutter ablation alone, particularly if atrial flutter is the predominant rhythm and if the rate in flutter is difficult and causing most symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimal approach to ablation in patients with both atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation was evaluated in the single-blind APPROVAL trial, which randomly assigned 360 patients to ablation of AF (with or without atrial flutter ablation) or ablation of flutter alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Among patients in the first group, 124 received AF ablation only and 58 had both ablation procedures. At nearly 22 months of follow-up, patients assigned to the group that received AF ablation (with or without atrial flutter ablation) had a higher rate of primary end point of freedom from arrhythmia off antiarrhythmic drug therapy during follow-up (64 versus 19 percent). This outcome was similar for the two subpopulations in the first group (AF ablation with or without atrial flutter ablation). Patients in group one had significant improvement in scores on most quality-of-life measures, whereas those in group two did not. </p><p>The finding in APPROVAL of similar outcomes between patients who received both AF and atrial flutter ablation and those who received AF ablation alone was noted in an earlier study of 108 patients with both AF and typical atrial flutter who were randomly assigned to either a dual ablative procedure (pulmonary vein isolation [PVI] and CTI ablation, 49 patients) or PVI alone (59 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>These findings suggest that pulmonary vein triggers appear to initiate atrial flutter as well as AF. This conclusion is consistent with evidence that atrial flutter commonly starts after a transitional rhythm of variable duration, usually AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

However, similar issues apply to patients with atrial flutter (and atrial fibrillation) in whom antiarrhythmic drug therapy is to be started. Any therapy that causes conversion of atrial flutter (or fibrillation) to sinus rhythm leads to a measurable increase in the short-term risk of embolization unless proper anticoagulation is in place.

For low-risk patients, it may be reasonable to proceed with ablation without a TEE.

However, there are no studies that directly address this issue. We use the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend oral anticoagulation for all patients for at least one month after atrial flutter ablation if they were in atrial flutter at the start of the ablation. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with evidence of recurrent atrial flutter after atrial flutter ablation or a history of atrial fibrillation we continue anticoagulation indefinitely in most patients or at least six months at which time re-evaluation of the need for long-term anticoagulation can occur. It may be reasonable to anticoagulate the rare patient with a history of AF and a CHADS2 score of &le;1 for only one month.</p><p/><p>This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Unlike atrial fibrillation, the alternative strategy of rate control is usually unsuccessful. (See <a href=\"#H351873061\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with typical atrial flutter in whom a rhythm control strategy is desired, we recommend radiofrequency catheter ablation rather than a pharmacologic approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'RF catheter ablation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3663665\" class=\"local\">'RF ablation versus pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with both atrial flutter and fibrillation, we recommend radiofrequency catheter ablation of the atrial fibrillation rather than ablation of atrial flutter alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In most cases, we also perform ablation of atrial flutter during the same procedure, as there is little additional risk. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Patients with atrial fibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><br/>For those patients in whom atrial flutter is the predominant rhythm, atrial flutter ablation alone is a reasonable strategy. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulation around the time of radiofrequency catheter ablation or pharmacologic cardioversion is handled in a manner similar to that for patients with atrial flutter or fibrillation scheduled to undergo cardioversion. Most patients will require effective anticoagulation both before and after the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H13091376\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2764944760\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would like to thank Dr. Jie Cheng, who contributed as an author to prior versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wells JL Jr, MacLean WA, James TN, Waldo AL.
