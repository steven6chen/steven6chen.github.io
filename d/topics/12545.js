In the United States alone, up to 40 million people run regularly, with more than 10 million running at least 100 days a year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although running is an effective way to achieve many health benefits, it is associated with a high risk of injury; yearly, up to half of runners report an injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although some injuries are traumatic, most are due to overuse.</p><p>Given the popularity of running and the high rate of associated overuse injuries amenable to nonsurgical management, the primary care physician is likely to manage many injured runners and should be familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of common problems. The risk factors, diagnosis, management, and prevention of common lower extremity injuries associated with running are reviewed here. Detailed discussions of some specific injuries are found separately, including those listed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-sprain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle sprain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patellofemoral-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patellofemoral pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iliotibial-band-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iliotibial band syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hamstring-muscle-and-tendon-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hamstring muscle and tendon injuries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-metatarsal-shaft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the metatarsal shaft&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-tarsal-foot-navicular\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the tarsal (foot) navicular&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plantar-fasciitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Plantar fasciitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24287083\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of lower extremity injuries in runners ranges from 19.4 to 79.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The knee is the most commonly injured body part. The most common diagnoses include: patellofemoral pain, medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints), Achilles tendinopathy, iliotibial band syndrome, plantar fasciitis, and stress fractures of the metatarsals and tibia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. According to a 2009 survey of more than 11,000 year-round runners, more than 10 percent experienced hip <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low back pain in the previous 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among marathon runners, men report more hamstring and calf problems, whereas women report more hip complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Running is a common cause of injury among military personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>One retrospective survey of 2886 runners reported an overall injury rate of 46 percent, but found a higher incidence of soft tissue injuries to the calf, Achilles tendon, and hamstring among masters runners (&gt;40 years), who comprised 34 percent of the participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Injured runners were more likely to be male and to run six days per week and more than 30 miles each week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24287090\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the popularity of running and the prevalence of related injuries, few studies have successfully identified the individual factors most responsible, suggesting that many running injuries are multifactorial. A history of prior injury is one of the few variables that has consistently been shown to increase the risk of incurring a subsequent running injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/2,4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,11</a>]. Therefore, every injured runner seeking medical attention should be questioned about prior injuries, including treatments. Incomplete rehabilitation and failure to address potential risk factors associated with a prior injury increases the likelihood of recurrence. Greater mileage is another factor that is consistently associated with increased injury risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Obesity is associated with an increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Multiple risk factors are likely to contribute to running injuries. These can be stratified into intrinsic risk factors (eg, anatomic and other individual variables, including gender and BMI) and extrinsic risk factors (eg, training variables and equipment).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24287097\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrinsic risk factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24287105\"><span class=\"h3\">Anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Running injuries have been attributed to a number of anatomic variables, but the literature does not support many of these commonly held beliefs. A prime example is patellofemoral pain, a common cause of knee pain in runners. Lower extremity alignment that results in a greater Q angle at the knee (common in women) has often been cited as a cause of patellofemoral pain, but the large majority of studies refute this assertion.</p><p>Foot type is another purported risk factor, but most studies of runners have not found consistent relationships between foot structure and specific injuries. One group studying collegiate cross country runners failed to identify any association between structural variations and the likelihood of developing exercise-related leg pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. One notable exception is cavus foot (high arch), which is associated with myriad injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>]. Specific injuries implicated in one or more studies include tibial stress fractures, patellofemoral pain, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-tibia-and-fibula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the tibia and fibula&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patellofemoral-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patellofemoral pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plantar-fasciitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Plantar fasciitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some researchers have proposed that limb asymmetry (ie, leg length discrepancy) may increase injury risk, including stress fracture, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], but not all studies support this conclusion. These conflicting results suggest that anatomy alone is not sufficient to explain the high risk of injury among runners. Many experienced sports medicine clinicians believe that the important issue is whether the difference in leg length affects gait, rather than whether some measurement threshold is reached.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24287112\"><span class=\"h3\">Gender and age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gender and age may play a role in some running injuries, but the literature is conflicting in this regard:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study of 844 male and female runners following a training program in preparation for a 10 km race reported an increased risk of injury among women age 50 or older and a lower risk among those 30 or younger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study of 532 novice runners participating in a 13-week training program noted that higher BMI was a risk factor for male but not female runners (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05-1.26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Conversely, navicular drop was associated with injury in females but not males (HR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.97).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A longitudinal study of former high school cross country runners over a 15 year period reported that girls had significantly higher injury rates than boys (16.7 versus 10.9 injuries per 1000 athletic exposures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>Studies consistently report an association between female gender and stress fracture risk, particularly among females with lower bone density, menstrual disturbances, and dietary deficiencies, as seen in the female athlete triad. The risk factors for stress fracture are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-fractures#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress fractures&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>While not consistently identified as a risk factor for running injury, age has been associated with a number of injuries in several observational studies. In contrast to the prospective study described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], a retrospective study of more than 2000 runners found that age <strong>under</strong> 34 was associated with an increased risk for patellofemoral pain in both men and women and an increased risk for iliotibial band syndrome, patellar tendinopathy, and tibial stress syndrome among men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These findings may reflect that master runners (&gt;40 years) are primarily those with low injury rates, while runners who sustain multiple injuries are more likely to give up the sport.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24287119\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrinsic risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have not consistently supported many traditional beliefs about the association between anatomic variations and injury risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This has led many researchers to focus both on the effects of extrinsic factors on running injury and on the combination of intrinsic and extrinsic variables.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24287126\"><span class=\"h3\">Training variables</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measures to reduce running injuries often include modifying training variables, such as mileage and intensity. A systematic review concluded that reducing the distance, frequency, and duration of running may be effective in preventing soft tissue injuries in runners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In male runners, excessive mileage is associated with higher injury rates. Multiple observational studies report that training volumes of 65 km (40 miles) or more per week increase the risk of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/2,3,10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,10,12</a>]. While most sports medicine practitioners believe excessive mileage also affects female runners, well designed clinical studies have not been performed. It is unclear if more experienced runners are less susceptible.</p><p>Abrupt changes in training regimens can contribute to running injuries. Studies of military recruits report that sudden increases in training volume or changes in the type of training (eg, adding hill running) increase injury rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although many sports medicine physicians advocate the 10 percent rule (ie, increase training volume by no more than 10 percent per week), a randomized trial of this approach in 532 novice runners reported no reduction in injuries (20.8 versus 20.3 percent with standard training) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Nevertheless, common sense would suggest that gradual increases in training volume are less likely to cause injury than sudden increases.</p><p>Some types of training may be protective. As an example, one research group found that regular interval training is protective against knee injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Running surface probably affects injury rates. Running on concrete is associated with increased risk, while running on a treadmill reduces the stresses placed on the tibia and may thereby reduce the risk of tibial stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24287134\"><span class=\"h3\">Stretching and warm-ups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is hard to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of stretching for reducing the risk of running injuries due to the large number of variables involved. These variables include a runner's baseline flexibility, the timing of stretching (pre-exercise, post-exercise, or not in conjunction with exercise), and the method of stretching (eg, dynamic, static, or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation). Despite a dearth of convincing evidence, many sports medicine physicians, running coaches, and runners believe that stretching is beneficial. However, further research is needed to determine which runners benefit and what methods to use.</p><p>Multiple studies question the benefit of stretching, long a piece of injury prevention advice given to runners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. A systematic review of randomized trials that assessed multiple interventions designed to prevent running injuries included six studies involving 5130 runners that looked at stretching exercises and concluded that stretching regimens do not protect against soft tissue injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The stretching regimens included in these studies varied in the muscle groups targeted, the timing of the intervention (eg, before or after training), whether a warm-up was also performed, and other factors. Another review that included both randomized trials and cohort studies investigating the effect of stretching on injury reduction during sports also concluded that stretching was not associated with a reduction in total injuries (OR 0.93; CI 0.78-1.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Stretching may have other benefits. As an example, in a study of 900 military recruits, those who stretched regularly experienced lower rates of low back and soft tissue pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Stretching may also play a useful role in the management of other injuries, such as plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plantar-fasciitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Plantar fasciitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is insufficient high-quality research in runners to determine whether warming up reduces injury rates. One randomized trial involving 421 runners found that an educational intervention regarding warm-up, cool-down, and stretching did not significantly reduce the risk of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Nevertheless, many clinicians advocate a dynamic warm-up or light jogging before engaging in strenuous running and we concur with this approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H895396035\"><span class=\"h3\">Running shoes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24287141\"><span class=\"h4\">Running shoe design and orthotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Debate continues about the role running shoes and orthotics may play in reducing the risk of injury. Based on limited evidence and clinical experience, we suggest using the running shoe that feels most comfortable, fits properly, and is well suited to the shape of the runner's foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/23,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,33,34</a>].</p><p>There are three basic types of running shoes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoes for runners with a low foot arch (over-pronators) that are designed to minimize foot motion and maintain the foot in a neutral position</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoes for runners with a neutral foot shape</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoes with extensive cushioning for runners with a cavus foot (over-supinators)</p><p/><p>Many clinicians and runners believe that selecting the shoe best suited to the runner's foot type prevents injury; however, this concept is not well supported by the literature and further study is needed. Studies of recruits in the United States Marine Corps and Air Force undergoing basic training found that assigning shoes to recruits based on foot type did not significantly reduce injury rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In addition, a systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the prescription of running shoes based upon foot type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], while the results of a subsequent trial suggest that the level of cushioning may not affect injury rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this trial, 247 recreational runners were randomly assigned to wear running shoes that differed only in midsole hardness for five months and to report their running volume and all running-related injuries. No significant difference was noted in injury rates between the two groups. </p><p>However, it remains possible that particular shoe types reduce the risk of injury in particular subpopulations of runners (eg, runners with cavus feet or pronated feet). One crossover randomized trial found that some popular, neutral-cushioned running shoes reduced plantar pressures in the cavus foot, theoretically reducing injury risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A prospective observational study of 372 recreational runners reported a reduction in injury rates among runners with foot pronation who were given motion control shoes; no comparable reduction was seen among runners with neutral or supinated feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Thus, control of pronation may reduce injury in this subpopulation of runners, but further study is needed. </p><p>Regardless of shoe type, several studies of the shock absorption properties of running shoes have shown that new shoes lose up to half their cushioning after 250 to 500 running miles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Therefore, most sports medicine practitioners counsel runners to change their running shoes every 350 to 500 miles. </p><p>Orthotics reduce the risk of some injuries. A randomized controlled trial of 400 military officer trainees found a significant reduction in lower extremity overuse injuries in the trainees given customized orthotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and other studies performed primarily in military recruits have found they reduce the risk of lower extremity stress fractures. Other reports have found that orthotics reduce the pain associated with patellofemoral pain and cavus foot, both common issues in runners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. The role of orthotics in reducing the risk of stress fractures is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-fractures#H61\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress fractures&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1437797257\"><span class=\"h4\">Shoe drop</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important design feature of running shoes is the &quot;drop&quot; of the shoe, which is the change in height from heel to forefoot. Depending upon a person&rsquo;s running gait mechanics and training volume, different drops may predispose or conversely help to prevent injury, according to some researchers. In one trial, 553 recreational runners were randomly assigned to use identical running shoes that differed only in drop (0, 6, or 10 mm) and followed for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Although the overall injury rate did not differ by group, regular runners using low drop shoes (0 or 6 mm) sustained injuries at a significantly higher rate than regular runners using high drop shoes (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.07-2.62). This finding is consistent with our clinical experience, and suggests that many recreational runners benefit from the reduced impact associated with a larger drop, although additional study is needed to confirm this finding.</p><p>Overall, we suggest caution when runners, particularly those who run regularly (eg, several times per week), are considering a change in running shoe design. If a particular shoe design fits well and there is no history of injury, it seems prudent to continue with a shoe of similar design. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1364868347\"><span class=\"h4\">Running barefoot or with minimalist shoes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although running barefoot or with &quot;minimalist&quot; shoes (eg, Vibram FiveFingers) is gaining popularity, few controlled studies of these approaches to running have been performed, and it remains unclear whether such shoes have negative or positive effects upon performance or injury rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. A review by a noted authority concludes that little is known about barefoot running, and there is much work to be done to determine whether a barefoot style can be used to treat or prevent injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The potential benefits of barefoot running or the use of minimalist shoes may be due to the changes in gait that are required when using such an approach. These include a shorter stride length and a midfoot or forefoot strike, which is thought to reduce impact compared with the rearfoot strike used by many runners wearing traditional, cushioned running shoes.</p><p>Given the limited studies available, the indications and guidelines for transitioning to a barefoot style or minimalist running shoes are largely anecdotal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. One of the few randomized trials of minimalist running shoes found that greater body mass and higher mileage appear to increase the risk of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In this trial, 61 trained runners with a rearfoot strike were randomly assigned to minimalist or standard running shoes, and then gradually increased the time spent running in the designated shoes over 26 weeks. Of the 27 injuries sustained, 16 occurred in runners using minimalist shoes and 11 in runners using conventional running shoes. Injury risk was increased among runners with increased body mass using minimalist shoes (HR 2.00; 95% CI 1.10-3.66 for runners with a body mass of 85.7 kg). </p><p>Based on available evidence and our clinical experience, we suggest that those making the transition to barefoot running or running in minimalist shoes do so gradually, starting with relatively low mileage, and increasing their weekly training by no more than 1.7 km (1 mile) per week. In addition, available evidence supports running no more than 35 km (22 miles) total per week in minimalist shoes or barefoot, as additional mileage may increase the risk of injury. Furthermore, we suggest that runners over 85 kg (187 lbs) not use minimalist shoes, and even runners over 75 kg (165 lbs) may sustain fewer injuries by using conventional running shoes. Runners who develop lower extremity pain during or following the transition to minimalist shoes are likely better off training solely in conventional running shoes. </p><p>A few studies, mostly observational and involving small numbers of runners, suggest that some injuries (eg, stress fractures of the foot) occur more often in those using minimalist shoes, particularly if the transition to such footwear is not made gradually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-56</a>]. However, other observational studies report no increase in injuries overall among younger and fitter runners who use minimalist shoes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Multiple studies report that inadequate vitamin D, calcium, and calorie intake increases the risk of stress fracture in female military recruits and runners. In addition, a prospective study of 86 female runners found that low-fat intake increased the risk of sustaining a low extremity injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

A position paper on nutrition and performance authored jointly by Dietitians of Canada, the American College of Sports Medicine, and the American Dietetic Association makes the following recommendations for athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consume adequate calories. Insufficient calories can lead to reduced muscle mass and bone density, cessation of menses, and delayed recovery, and can increase fatigue and the risk of injury and illness. In general, fewer than 1800 to 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcals/day</span> is inadequate for an exercising individual, although many female runners restrict calories to this level. Several tools are available to estimate calorie needs, including the Dietary Reference Intakes and the Dietary Guidelines from the United States Department of Agriculture (available <a href=\"https://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/interactiveDRI/&amp;token=wEsKVFvqlKzpT+qOtddW/1LNGrzw/PnRXlNbZ+h3ada8cX+Ym4JG7C+1mE3mb6Aa8VshTCSiOSctQfmDrK9EcA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16321\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">here</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consume adequate carbohydrates. Runners need approximately 6 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">gram/kg</span> body weight of carbohydrates daily. Carbohydrates are critical for maintaining blood glucose during exercise and replenishing muscle glycogen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-carbohydrates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary carbohydrates&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consume adequate protein. Endurance athletes need 1.2 to 1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> body weight of protein daily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consume adequate healthy fats. Healthy fats are a source of energy and provide essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins, and should comprise 20 to 35 percent of total calorie intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-fat\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary fat&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay hydrated.

Runners should drink before, during, and after exercise. An easy rule of thumb is to weigh yourself before and after running, and drink 16 to 24 ounces (450 to 675 mL) of fluid for every pound (0.5 kg) lost during exercise. For long or intense exercise (eg, marathon), it is also important to replace electrolytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-associated-hyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-associated hyponatremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The timing of nutrient intake is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. A snack high in carbohydrate, moderate in protein, and low in fat and fiber is generally well-tolerated prior to exercise, whereas a snack higher in fat and fiber may cause gastrointestinal cramping or other distress. During exercise that lasts more than one hour, the athlete needs fluids and small amounts of carbohydrate, such as that found in sports drinks. The runner should be encouraged to replenish glycogen stores by consuming carbohydrate, 1.0 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of body weight, within 30 minutes of exercise, and to continue &quot;refueling&quot; every two hours for four to six hours. These goals can be met with relatively small amounts of food.</p><p>Some researchers suggest adding protein to post-training snacks to aid muscle recovery; this is likely most beneficial to the runner who does not take in adequate carbohydrate following exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Regardless of the specific approach, it is helpful for runners to become familiar with the concepts of &quot;grams&quot; and to learn how to apply this to their preferred foods.</p><p>Although an adequate, well-rounded diet provides the majority of vitamins and minerals needed by athletes, special mention should be made of iron. Iron requirements are greater in endurance runners than in non-endurance athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Iron is lost through sweat, the gastrointestinal tract, and menstruation. Thus, iron depletion is particularly common among premenopausal female runners. Any runner complaining of fatigue and decreased performance, especially females, should have a serum ferritin measured. If low, iron levels can be increased through diet and supplementation, but dietary replacement appears to be more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Although muscle adapts to regular exercise, some exercise-induced muscle damage occurs, mediated in part by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As antioxidants reduce ROS, some athletes take high doses of the antioxidants (eg, vitamins C and E) hoping to attenuate muscle damage. However, there is little evidence to support this practice, and there is some evidence that interfering with ROS signals may impair muscle performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

Many running clinics are seeing an increase in metatarsal stress fractures in individuals new to this approach. Barefoot running and running in minimalist shoes is discussed in greater detail above.

Discrepancies may exist between legs or between muscle groups of the same leg (eg, quadriceps disproportionately stronger than hamstrings). One way to organize each element (eg, observation, strength testing) of the physical examination is to begin with proximal structures (eg, spine and pelvis) and work distally. Careful observation of the patient's walking and running gaits helps to confirm that the anatomic problems identified during a stationary examination affect biomechanical performance. </p><p>Begin your assessment by asking the injured runner to stand in front of you, noting their posture and lower extremity alignment. Observe the legs from hip-to-foot looking for symmetry. Note the structure of the knee, especially genu varum (which may be associated with iliotibial band syndrome or medial meniscal pathology) or valgus (often seen in women with patellofemoral pain). Note the position of the patella and any apparent muscular asymmetry. Ask the patient to stand on one foot and then the other, watching for balance, control, and posture. Does the unsupported hip sag (ie, a positive Trendelenburg test)? A positive Trendelenburg test suggests weakness of the gluteus medius, a common finding in runners with hip and knee pain. Make note of foot structure and position. Does the runner have a normal, high, or flat arch? Ask the patient to walk and to squat. Watch for a limp, stiffness of one limb, and a tendency to shift weight off one limb.</p><p>Screen for tenderness and altered mobility of the spine, pelvis (including sacroiliac joints), hips, knees, ankles, and feet before turning your attention to the area of complaint. Be sure to assess muscle strength and neurovascular status throughout the lower extremity. Weakness of the hip musculature (particularly hip abductors) is common among novice runners, frequently contributing to lower extremity pain, especially patellofemoral pain.

The mainstay of treatment for the vast majority of running injuries is &quot;relative rest,&quot; which means stopping running, or at a minimum significantly reducing mileage, while the injury heals. Depending upon the injury, most runners can maintain reasonable conditioning by performing non-impact exercises in a pool or on a bike, or by using other equipment (eg, rowing machine).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7409762\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC INJURIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2791000\"><span class=\"h2\">Hip injuries</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2791008\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview and approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hip injuries are less common in runners than injuries to the lower extremity and they can be difficult to diagnose. Nevertheless, during jogging, the hip joint is subjected to loads up to eight times body weight and both acute and chronic injuries can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In runners, the differential diagnosis of hip pain includes gluteus medius tendinopathy, piriformis syndrome, stress fracture of the femoral neck, labral tear, and, less often, radicular pain from the lumbar spine. Better understanding of the functional anatomy of the hip suggests a correlation between hip muscle weakness and injury to the low back or lower extremity in athletes, including runners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2791015\"><span class=\"h3\">Gluteus medius weakness and tendinopathy and piriformis syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gluteus medius originates along the external surface of the ilium and runs distally and laterally to its attachment on the greater trochanter of the femur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53747\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53747 \">figure 1</a>). The gluteus medius abducts the hip and assists with pelvic stability during running. Weakness of the muscle typically causes pain with hip abduction and rotation. Pain generally increases when the muscle is stretched and there may be focal tenderness at the muscle's insertion, just medial and superior to the greater trochanter. Difficulty maintaining a level pelvis while standing on one leg (positive Trendelenburg sign) may be noted.</p><p>The piriformis muscle is a small but important external rotator of the hip that crosses the sciatic nerve and is believed by some to cause sciatica-type pain when it compresses the nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].

Piriformis syndrome in the runner may be associated with foot overpronation, weakness of the gluteal muscles and other hip abductors, and tightness of the hip adductors.</p><p>The mainstay of treatment for both gluteus medius tendinopathy and piriformis syndrome is physical therapy and correction of biomechanical abnormalities. Orthotics and massage therapy may be useful; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be used for analgesia.

It is thought to be largely avascular. Although the labrum's function is not fully understood, it is thought to provide stability and decrease the stress placed on the hip joint. Therefore, a significant tear in the labrum can increase stress on the hip joint, decrease stability, and ultimately lead to damage of the articular cartilage.</p><p>Labral tears are reported in sports that require frequent hip rotation, such as soccer and hockey, and in runners, especially female runners. Runners with a labral tear typically complain of pain in the anterior hip or groin.

Other hip injuries that may produce such mechanical symptoms include iliopsoas tendinopathy.</p><p>Labral tears are complex and often frustrating to treat. Physical therapy has mixed results. Arthroscopic surgery is often helpful, but the recovery can be prolonged.

Most such runners are diagnosed with patellofemoral pain (PFP). Despite the prevalence of this diagnosis, no consensus exists about its etiology or the factors most responsible for causing pain. Overuse and malalignment are commonly cited causative factors. In addition, runners (especially females) with PFP often have decreased strength in hip abduction, external rotation, and extension compared to healthy controls. Patients with PFP typically complain of anterior knee pain that worsens with squatting, running, prolonged sitting, or when ascending or descending steps. Pain is often poorly localized &quot;under&quot; or &quot;around&quot; the patella. Details about the diagnosis and management of PFP are provided separately.

Runners often complain of such lateral knee pain while running, but pain may persist after training, especially with activity that requires repetitive flexion and extension of the knee, such as ascending or descending stairs or standing from a seated position. The diagnosis of ITBS is clinical; no imaging is typically needed. A detailed discussion is provided separately.

The predominant symptom of PF is pain in the plantar region of the foot that increases when initiating push-off while walking or running. The hallmark for diagnosis is focal point tenderness.

Some clinicians advocate using a heel pad or orthotic in runners to counteract this effect.</p><p>Patients with Achilles tendinopathy typically complain of pain or stiffness 2 to 6 cm above the posterior calcaneus. The pain is frequently described as burning, increases with activity, and is relieved by rest. Runners with the condition often have recently increased their training intensity or have been training rigorously for a long time.

However, some runners may present with vague lateral forefoot pain. This presentation is likely due to runners shifting their body weight to the lateral foot during the foot-strike phase of running to reduce the load on the great toe. It remains unclear whether running is a cause of hallux rigidus or aggravates symptoms elicited by other factors. Shoes with a toe box that is too small or pointed may contribute.</p><p>Hallux valgus (ie, bunion) deformity is defined as a lateral deviation of the hallux (great toe) on the first metatarsal. The etiology of hallux valgus is multifactorial and likely involves abnormal mechanics and anatomy. Patients generally complain of a deformed and painful great toe.

The runner with sesamoiditis typically complains of pain at the area of the MTP joint with weightbearing that is exacerbated by walking, and even more so by running. Exquisite tenderness of the sesamoids is present, and is exacerbated by dorsiflexion of the great toe. Imaging is required to differentiate between sesamoiditis and a stress fracture.</p><p>Both sesamoiditis and sesamoid stress fractures are notoriously difficult to treat and may require a short period of immobilization followed by prolonged rest from running. Runners can use alternative, nonweightbearing forms of exercise to maintain fitness. Treatment with custom orthotics, soft pads cut to relieve pressure on the sesamoids, and in severe cases glucocorticoid injections may be helpful, but there is little evidence to guide treatment.

This approach involves decreasing pressure on the metatarsal heads by using a metatarsal support or bar or padded shoe insert. Strength exercises for the intrinsic foot muscles are often part of conservative treatment.

Runners with TTS complain of numbness or burning pain, usually along the plantar surface of the foot, although complaints may be localized to the medial plantar surface of the heel, mimicking plantar fasciitis. TTS typically worsens with running or at night. Findings are almost always sensory; muscle weakness is uncommon. A positive Tinel sign may be present. As in carpal tunnel syndrome, a positive sign occurs when symptoms are elicited by tapping over the path of the nerve. TTS is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Tarsal tunnel syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26387930\"><span class=\"h3\">Toenail injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Athletes in many sports sustain toenail injuries from repetitive trauma to the nail or nail bed. In runners, this condition is commonly called &quot;jogger's toenail&quot;, and it most frequently affects the great toe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107143\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107143 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. The nail may turn black (due to subungual bleeding) or may fall off, especially after a long distance run such as a marathon. The differential diagnosis for these injuries includes fungal infection and subungual melanoma. The management of acute subungual hematoma, fungal infection of the nail (onychomycosis), and melanoma are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subungual-hematoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subungual hematoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onychomycosis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onychomycosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;, section on 'Subungual'</a>.)</p><p>In the author's experience, toenail injuries in runners are most often due to poorly fitting shoes. Thus, injuries can be prevented by using properly fitted running shoes. Such shoes provide sufficient space in the toe-box and are sized to accommodate the longest toe. The midfoot portion of the shoe should fit properly and be sufficiently snug to prevent the toes from slipping forward and striking against the end of the toe box.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3307724482\"><span class=\"h3\">Friction blisters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Friction blisters are caused by continual rubbing or pressure on the skin, and are common among runners. They affect runners of all levels of experience, from novices to professionals, and all distances, from sprinters to ultramarathon competitors. In a study of 204 amateur runners over the age of 18, blisters were self-reported as one of the three most frequent injuries (along with sprains and abrasions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Blisters develop most often on the toes, ball of the foot, and heel.</p><p>Runners and clinicians have used various interventions to prevent blisters, with varying results reported. In our clinical experience, the following interventions are helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear properly fitting running shoes. (See <a href=\"#H24287141\" class=\"local\">'Running shoe design and orthotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear properly fitting socks made from materials that reduce friction and wick moisture from the skin. Make sure the portion of the sock between the shoe and the skin is wrinkle-free.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At areas known to be susceptible to blisters (&quot;hot spots&quot;) in particular runners, apply a viscous lubricant or a protective bandage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For lubricants, the author has found SkinLube and Blisterblock to be useful products. We have found Vaseline to be less effective. For protective bandages, we have found Blisterderm and Moleskin to be helpful.</p><p/><p>Several randomized trials of paper tape for blister prevention were performed during RaceThePlanet ultramarathons (250 <span class=\"nowrap\">km/155</span> mile race) in 2010 to 2011, and again in 2014. During the first trial, all 136 runner participants developed blisters during the race, and reported that paper tape was not protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. In a subsequent trial involving 128 race participants, the authors reported that paper tape reduced blisters by 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. In an observational study of ultra-distance runners, no prophylactic measures, including taping, application of talcum powder and antiperspirants, and different types of socks, reduced blister rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. In this study, the only factor associated with a reduction in blisters was prior ultra-distance race experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. A study from 1990 reported that acrylic fiber socks were associated with fewer and smaller blisters, but a 1993 follow-up study clarified that acrylic socks were only superior when they were knitted in such a way as to provide &quot;anatomical padding&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/114,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,115</a>].</p><p>If a friction blister has formed, it should not be unroofed in most cases. However, large, fluid-filled blisters in problematic locations may be drained in sterile fashion, and covered with a clean bandage. Runners generally do not need to wait until a blister has completely healed before resuming running, but it makes sense to perform alternative exercises (eg, cycling, swimming) that do not aggravate the affected area for a few days while the blister is allowed to heal. Proper technique for draining a friction blister is described separately.
