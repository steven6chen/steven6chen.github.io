Elevated ICP may complicate trauma, central nervous system (CNS) tumors, hydrocephalus, hepatic encephalopathy, and impaired CNS venous outflow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69683 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Successful management of patients with elevated ICP requires prompt recognition, the judicious use of invasive monitoring, and therapy directed at both reducing ICP and reversing its underlying cause.</p><p>The evaluation and management of adult patients with elevated ICP will be reviewed here. Elevated intracranial pressure in children and specific causes and complications of elevated ICP (eg, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury) are discussed separately.

ICP is normally lower in children than adults, and may be subatmospheric in newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Homeostatic mechanisms stabilize ICP, with occasional transient elevations associated with physiologic events, including sneezing, coughing, or Valsalva maneuvers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracranial components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, the intracranial compartment is protected by the skull, a rigid structure with a fixed internal volume of 1400 to 1700 mL. Under physiologic conditions, the intracranial contents include (by volume) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain parenchyma &mdash; 80 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid &mdash; 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood &mdash; 10 percent</p><p/><p>Pathologic structures, including mass lesions, abscesses, and hematomas also may be present within the intracranial compartment. Since the overall volume of the cranial vault cannot change, an increase in the volume of one component, or the presence of pathologic components, necessitates the displacement of other structures, an increase in ICP, or both. Thus, ICP is a function of the volume and compliance of each component of the intracranial compartment, an interrelationship known as the Monro-Kellie doctrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The volume of brain parenchyma is relatively constant in adults, although it can be altered by mass lesions or in the setting of cerebral edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65853\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65853 \">figure 1</a>). The volumes of CSF and blood in the intracranial space vary to a greater degree. Abnormal increases in the volume of any component may lead to elevations in ICP.</p><p>CSF is produced by the choroid plexus and elsewhere in the central nervous system (CNS) at a rate of approximately 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/h</span> (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. CSF is normally resorbed via the arachnoid granulations into the venous system. Problems with CSF regulation generally result from impaired outflow caused by ventricular obstruction or venous congestion; the latter can occur in patients with sagittal (or other) venous sinus thrombosis. Much less frequently, CSF production can become pathologically increased; this may be seen in the setting of choroid plexus papilloma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebrospinal fluid: Physiology and utility of an examination in disease states&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) determines the volume of blood in the intracranial space. CBF increases with hypercapnia and hypoxia. Other determinants of CBF are discussed below. Autoregulation of CBF may be impaired in the setting of neurologic injury, and may result in rapid and severe brain swelling, especially in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>In summary, the major causes of increased intracranial pressure include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracranial mass lesions (eg, tumor, hematoma)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral edema (such as in acute hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, large cerebral infarction, severe traumatic brain injury)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production, eg, choroid plexus papilloma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased CSF absorption, eg, arachnoid granulation adhesions after bacterial meningitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive hydrocephalus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstruction of venous outflow, eg, venous sinus thrombosis, jugular vein compression, neck surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracranial compliance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interrelationship between changes in the volume of intracranial contents and changes in ICP defines the compliance characteristics of the intracranial compartment. Intracranial compliance can be modeled mathematically (as in other physiologic and mechanical systems) as the change in volume over the change in pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">(dV/dP)</span>.</p><p>The compliance relationship is nonlinear, and compliance decreases as the combined volume of the intracranial contents increases. Initially, compensatory mechanisms allow volume to increase with minimal elevation in ICP. These mechanisms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Displacement of CSF into the thecal sac</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease in the volume of the cerebral venous blood via venoconstriction and extracranial drainage</p><p/><p>However, when these compensatory mechanisms have been exhausted, significant increases in pressure develop with small increases in volume, leading to abnormally elevated ICP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54602\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54602 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Thus, the magnitude of the change in volume of an individual structure determines its effect on ICP. In addition, the rate of change in the volume of the intracranial contents influences ICP. Changes that occur slowly produce less of an effect than those that are rapid. This can be recognized clinically in some patients who present with large meningiomas and minimally elevated or normal ICP. Conversely, other patients may experience symptomatic elevations in ICP from small hematomas that develop acutely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebral blood flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following a significant increase in ICP, brain injury can result from brainstem compression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF). CBF is a function of the pressure drop across the cerebral circulation divided by the cerebrovascular resistance, as predicted by Ohm's law [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;CBF = (CAP - JVP) &divide; CVR</p></div></div><p>where CAP is carotid arterial pressure, JVP is jugular venous pressure, and CVR is cerebrovascular resistance.</p><p>Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is a clinical surrogate for the adequacy of cerebral perfusion. CPP is defined as mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus ICP.</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;CPP = MAP - ICP</p></div></div><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Autoregulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBF is normally maintained at a relatively constant level by cerebrovascular autoregulation of CVR over a wide range of CPP (50 to 100 mmHg) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57676\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57676 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, autoregulation of CVR can become dysfunctional in certain pathologic states, most notably stroke or trauma. In this setting, the brain becomes exquisitely sensitive to even minor changes in CPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Another important consideration is that the set-point of autoregulation is also changed in patients with chronic hypertension. With mild to moderate elevations in blood pressure, the initial response is arterial and arteriolar vasoconstriction. This autoregulatory process both maintains tissue perfusion at a relatively constant level and prevents the increase in pressure from being transmitted to the smaller, more distal vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As a result, acute reductions in blood pressure, even if the final value remains within the normal range, can produce ischemic symptoms in patients with chronic hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57676\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57676 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cerebral perfusion pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions associated with elevated ICP, including mass lesions and hydrocephalus, can be associated with a reduction in CPP. This can result in devastating focal or global ischemia. On the other hand, excessive elevation of CPP can lead to hypertensive encephalopathy and cerebral edema due to the eventual breakdown of autoregulation, particularly if the CPP is &gt;120 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/11,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,15</a>]. A higher level of CPP is tolerated in patients with chronic hypertension because the autoregulatory curve has shifted to the right (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57676\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57676 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>].

These manifestations can be further divided into generalized responses to elevated ICP and herniation syndromes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Global symptoms of elevated ICP include headache, which is probably mediated via the pain fibers of cranial nerve (CN) V in the dura and blood vessels, depressed global consciousness due to either the local effect of mass lesions or pressure on the midbrain reticular formation, and vomiting.</p><p>Signs include CN VI palsies, papilledema secondary to impaired axonal transport and congestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50378\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50378 \">picture 1</a>), spontaneous periorbital bruising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and a triad of bradycardia, respiratory depression, and hypertension (Cushing's triad, sometimes called Cushing's reflex or Cushing's response) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While the mechanism of Cushing's triad remains controversial, many believe that it relates to brainstem compression. The presence of this response is an ominous finding that requires urgent intervention.</p><p>Focal symptoms of elevated ICP may be caused by local effects in patients with mass lesions or by herniation syndromes. Herniation results when pressure gradients develop between two regions of the cranial vault. The most common anatomical locations affected by herniation syndromes include subfalcine, central transtentorial, uncal transtentorial, upward cerebellar, cerebellar <span class=\"nowrap\">tonsillar/foramen</span> magnum, and transcalvarial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76974\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76974 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;, section on 'Neurologic examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;, section on 'Coma syndromes'</a>.)</p><p>One notable false localizing syndrome seen following neurologic injury, referred to as Kernohan's notch phenomenon, consists of the combination of contralateral pupillary dilatation and ipsilateral weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Because the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms is limited, the findings described above may be inconstant or unreliable in any given case. Use of radiologic studies may support the diagnosis; however, the most reliable method of diagnosing elevated ICP is to measure it directly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ICP MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Empiric therapy for presumed elevated ICP is unsatisfactory because CPP cannot be monitored reliably without measurement of ICP. Furthermore, most therapies directed at lowering ICP are effective for limited and variable periods of time. In addition, these treatments may have serious side effects. Therefore, while initial steps to control ICP may, by necessity, be performed without the benefit of ICP monitoring, an important early goal in management of the patient with presumed elevated ICP is placement of an ICP monitoring device.</p><p>The purpose of monitoring ICP is to improve the clinician's ability to maintain adequate CPP and oxygenation. The only way to reliably determine CPP (defined as the difference between MAP and ICP) is to continuously monitor both ICP and blood pressure (BP). In general, these patients are managed in intensive care units (ICUs) with an ICP monitor and arterial line. The combination of ICP monitoring and concomitant management of CPP may improve patient outcomes, particularly in patients with closed head trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. The specific therapeutic targets for CPP in patients with traumatic brain injury are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute severe traumatic brain injury&quot;, section on 'Cerebral perfusion pressure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of elevated ICP generally is based on clinical findings, and corroborated by imaging studies and the patient's medical history. Closed head injury is one of the most frequent and best-studied indications for ICP monitoring. Much of the current practice of ICP monitoring has been derived from clinical experience with closed head trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Indications for ICP monitoring in this indication is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute severe traumatic brain injury&quot;, section on 'Intracranial pressure'</a>.)</p><p>Since ICP monitoring is associated with a small risk of serious complications, including CNS infection and intracranial hemorrhage, it is reasonable to try to limit its use to patients most at risk of elevated ICP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In general, invasive monitoring of ICP is indicated in patients who are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected to be at risk for elevated ICP</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;8) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosed with a process that merits aggressive medical care</p><p/><p>Although CT scans may suggest elevated ICP based on the presence of mass lesions, midline shift, or effacement of the basilar cisterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67017\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67017 \">image 1</a>), patients without these findings on initial CT may have elevated ICP. This was demonstrated in a prospective study of 753 patients treated at four major head injury research centers in the United States, which found patients whose initial CT scan did not show a mass lesion, midline shift, or abnormal cisterns had a 10 to 15 percent chance of developing elevated ICP during their hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Other studies have shown that up to one-third of patients with initially normal scans developed CT scan abnormalities within the first few days after closed head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Together, these findings demonstrate that ICP can be elevated even in the setting of a normal initial CT, demonstrating the importance of invasive monitoring in high-risk patients and the role of follow-up imaging in patients who develop clinical evidence of increased ICP during hospitalization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of monitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four main anatomical sites used in the clinical measurement of ICP: intraventricular, intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and epidural (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78630\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78630 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Noninvasive and metabolic monitoring of ICP has also been studied, but the clinical value of these methods is unclear at present. Each technique requires a unique monitoring system, and has associated advantages and disadvantages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraventricular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraventricular monitors are considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; of ICP monitoring catheters. They are surgically placed into the ventricular system and affixed to a drainage bag and pressure transducer with a three-way stopcock. Intraventricular monitoring has the advantage of accuracy, simplicity of measurement, and the unique characteristic of allowing for treatment of some causes of elevated ICP via drainage of CSF.</p><p>The primary disadvantage is infection, which may occur in up to 20 percent of patients. This risk increases the longer a device is in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Prophylactic catheter changes did not appear to reduce the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections of cerebrospinal fluid shunts and other devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A further disadvantage of intraventricular systems includes a small (approximately 2 percent) risk of hemorrhage during placement; this risk is greater in coagulopathic patients. In addition, it may be technically difficult to place an intraventricular drain into a small ventricle, particularly in the setting of trauma and cerebral edema complicated by ventricular compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraparenchymal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraparenchymal devices consist of a thin cable with an electronic or fiberoptic transducer at the tip. The most widely used device is the fiberoptic Camino system. These monitors can be inserted directly into the brain parenchyma via a small hole drilled in the skull. Advantages include ease of placement, and a lower risk of infection and hemorrhage (&lt;1 percent) than with intraventricular devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>Disadvantages include the inability to drain CSF for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes and the potential to lose accuracy (or &quot;drift&quot;) over several days, since the transducer cannot be recalibrated following initial placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition, there is a greater risk of mechanical failure due to the complex design of these monitors. The reliability of intraparenchymal devices has been debated. One group found only a small (1 mmHg) drift in a group of 163 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]; however, a second report found that readings varied by &gt;3 mmHg in more than half of the 50 patients studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Subarachnoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subarachnoid bolts are fluid-coupled systems within a hollow screw that can be placed through the skull adjacent to the dura. The dura is then punctured, which allows the CSF to communicate with the fluid column and transducer. The most commonly used subarachnoid monitor is the Richmond (or Becker) bolt; other types include the Philly bolt, the Leeds screw, and the Landy screw. These devices have low risk of infection and hemorrhage, but often clog with debris and are unreliable; therefore, they are rarely used. Additionally, they are believed to be less accurate than ventricular ICP devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Epidural</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidural monitors contain optical transducers that rest against the dura after passing through the skull. They often are inaccurate, as the dura damps the pressure transmitted to the epidural space, and thus are of limited clinical utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/30,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,39</a>]. They are used in the management of coagulopathic patients with hepatic encephalopathy complicated by cerebral edema.

The effect of hyperventilation on ICP is short-lived (1 to 24 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/113-115\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-115</a>]. Following therapeutic hyperventilation, the patient's respiratory rate should be tapered back to normal over several hours to avoid a rebound effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p>Therapeutic hyperventilation should be considered as an urgent intervention when elevated ICP complicates cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, and tumor. Hyperventilation should not be used on a chronic basis, regardless of the cause of increased ICP.</p><p>Hyperventilation should be minimized in patients with traumatic brain injury or acute stroke. In these settings, vasoconstriction may cause a critical decrease in local cerebral perfusion and worsen neurologic injury, particularly in the first 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/24,113,115,117-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,113,115,117-120</a>]. Thus, the need for hyperventilation should be carefully considered, and prophylactic hyperventilation in the absence of elevated ICP should be avoided.

In general, the use of barbiturates is a &quot;last-ditch&quot; effort, as several studies show that their ability to lower ICP does not appear to affect outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/112,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">112,128</a>].</p><p>Barbiturate therapy can be complicated by hypotension, possibly requiring vasopressor support. The use of barbiturates is also associated with a loss of the neurologic examination, requiring accurate ICP, hemodynamic, and often EEG monitoring to guide therapy. In this setting, thiopental has been reported to produce hypokalemia with induction and rebound hyperkalemia on drug cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic hypothermia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First reported as a treatment for brain injury in the 1950s, induced or therapeutic hypothermia has remained a controversial issue in the debate concerning the management of elevated ICP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/112,130,131\" class=\"abstract_t\">112,130,131</a>].

There is a growing body of literature supporting the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy in certain clinical situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/137-146\" class=\"abstract_t\">137-146</a>].

This results from the combined effects of atmospheric pressure with the negative pressure of the LP or ventriculostomy. It has also been described as a delayed complication three to five months after decompressive craniectomy for cerebral infarction in the absence of LP or ventriculostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. Marked decompression of the skin and dura over the skull defect accompanies and may precede neurologic signs of herniation. Standard treatments to lower ICP can hasten herniation.
