Following recovery from one episode, the estimated rate of recurrence over two years is greater than 40 percent; after two episodes, the risk of recurrence within five years is approximately 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-general-principles-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the general principles and prognosis for the initial treatment of depression. Choosing a therapy for the initial treatment of depression and the general evidence of efficacy of standard therapies are discussed separately, as are the evidence for therapies that are not typically used, and the evidence for standard therapies that are used for initially treating depression in primary care patients and in patients with general medical illnesses.

During this period, a patient diary that records problems with mood, sleep, appetite, energy, and cognition, as well as social and occupational activities, may help patients to accept treatment. Framing medication or psychotherapy as a trial (rather than a long-term commitment) may also be useful. In addition, patients may accept treatment more readily through understanding that depression is a brain disease rather than a character defect or sign of weakness, and that as an illness, depression is analogous to other diseases such as asthma that affects the lungs or diabetes that affects the pancreas.</p><p>However, patients with more severe depression (eg, PHQ score &ge;15) should be informed that delaying treatment may delay recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-general-principles-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of three studies (two observational studies and one randomized trial, total n = 486 patients with unipolar depression) found that remission was more likely in patients with a shorter duration of untreated illness, compared to patients with a longer duration (risk ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-general-principles-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The clinical features that distinguish severe depression from mild to moderate depression are discussed separately.

Therapeutic response, adverse effects, and adherence should be assessed, with particular attention given to symptoms of suicidal ideation and behavior, psychosis, agitation, and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-general-principles-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Following remission, the frequency of assessments can be tapered.

Adherence may be further enhanced by facilitating telephone access or secure messaging to the clinician for patient questions about side effects. (See <a href=\"#H221256\" class=\"local\">'Adherence to antidepressants'</a> below.)</p><p>At each visit, we suggest that clinicians provide measurement based care, which is the systematic, quantitative assessment of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-general-principles-and-prognosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Tolerability of treatment, adherence, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life can also be measured. Among the standardized instruments that are available to ascertain response to pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, the PHQ-9 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 1</a>) is the most widely used and studied. A decrease &ge;50 percent during treatment is typically regarded as a meaningful response to treatment, and a score &lt;5 indicates euthymia or remission. Measurement based care is consistent with multiple practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-general-principles-and-prognosis/abstract/12,13,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,22</a>].</p><p>The PHQ-9 and measurement based care are discussed separately.

Peer support or befriending has been used to treat symptoms that range in severity from subthreshold to depressive syndromes of minor and major depression. Evidence supporting the effectiveness of peer support or befriending includes a meta-analysis of nine randomized trials (1380 depressed patients) that compared the intervention with usual care or no treatment, and found a significant but clinically modest effect that favored befriending; heterogeneity across studies was moderate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-general-principles-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

One option when selecting a medication is to provide a list of possibilities and allow patients to make the final choice. In addition, patients are more likely to adhere to treatment if they choose the drug formulation (eg, tablets, transdermal patches, and liquid), frequency of doses, and timing of administration. Many patients prefer simpler regimens with fewer drugs that are prescribed less often per day. Multiple reviews of different illnesses indicate that adherence is superior with medications administered once per day compared with more frequent doses. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss with patients their expectations of benefits and adverse effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Elicit and emphasize benefits that are important to the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Negative expectations about the effects of medications can diminish therapeutic efficacy and amplify unwanted side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss plans for dose titrations and how the clinician will monitor the use and benefit of medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide simple and clear written instructions for taking prescribed medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggest pill boxes to organize daily doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggest the use of cues (eg, smart phone alarms, a written record, or pairing pill taking with another regular activity such as eating breakfast) as a reminder to take medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask about the patient&rsquo;s ability to follow the regimen and address barriers to adherence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Praise desirable behavior and results.</p><p/><p>Adherence is typically monitored through patient interviews, and less often by interviewing family members and reviewing medical records (some electronic health records enable clinicians to monitor prescription refills) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-general-principles-and-prognosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Clinicians should ask patients about adherence behavior and attitudes in a nonjudgmental manner. Patients may be more likely to discuss concerns or problems with adherence if clinicians initially ask open-ended questions (eg, &ldquo;How are you taking your medications?&rdquo;), normalize poor adherence (eg, &ldquo;Nearly everybody has trouble taking their medications&rdquo;), and explain that information about adherence is important in treatment decisions (eg, switching treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-general-principles-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The last step is to explicitly ask about missed doses. For patients who acknowledge poor adherence, follow-up questions should explore the reasons (eg, &ldquo;What gets in the way of taking your medications?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Did you feel better when you stopped the medicines?&rdquo;). Clinicians may ascribe noncompliance to incorrect reasons. </p><p>Regularly-scheduled office visits, especially upon medication initiation, may improve medication continuation and allows clinicians to monitor patients and adjust doses for side effects (see <a href=\"#H221226\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-general-principles-and-prognosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The frequency of monitoring adherence depends upon the patient&rsquo;s clinical status and presumed level of adherence. A lack of response to treatment, noticeable change in symptoms, or missed appointments should prompt an assessment. In addition, well-known patients who are thought to be fully compliant are generally assessed every one to three months. Relatively new patients who regularly adhere to treatment are monitored monthly. Patients whose adherence is problematic or who are not responding to treatment are monitored weekly. </p><p>Motivational interviewing is used to enhance adherence in many illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-and-initial-treatment-general-principles-and-prognosis/abstract/31,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,38</a>]. The basic aim of motivational interviewing is to help patients acknowledge that adherence with pharmacotherapy is problematic, make a commitment to change their behavior, and take action to change. The general approach is to initially ask questions and to give advice later. Other elements include expressing empathy (eg, &ldquo;I know this is hard&rdquo;), focusing upon collaboration (Let&rsquo;s work together on this&rdquo;), and avoiding arguments.</p><p>Treatment
