In the United States, endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the female reproductive system. Fortunately, most women are diagnosed at an early stage (before the cancer has spread outside the uterus), when the disease can usually be cured with surgery alone. Endometrial cancer can occur in a woman of any age, although it is much more common after menopause.</p><p>This article discusses the risk factors, symptoms, and diagnosis of the most common type of endometrial cancer, called endometrioid endometrial cancer. A separate article discusses the treatment of the endometrioid type of endometrial cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-cancer-treatment-after-surgery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Endometrial cancer treatment after surgery (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about endometrial cancer is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THE UTERUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To understand how endometrial cancer develops, it is helpful to understand the structure of the uterus. The uterus is a pear-shaped organ located between the bladder and the rectum. The cervix connects the uterus to the vagina. The inside of the uterus has two layers. The thin inner layer is called the endometrium. The thick outer layer is composed of muscle and is called the myometrium (myo = muscle) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In women who menstruate, the endometrium thickens every month in preparation for pregnancy. If the woman does not become pregnant, the endometrial lining is shed during the menstrual period. After menopause, when menstrual periods stop, the endometrial lining normally stops growing and shedding. In women who have endometrial cancer, the uterine lining develops abnormal cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOMETRIAL CANCER SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common sign of endometrial cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a woman who is still having menstrual periods, abnormal bleeding is defined as bleeding between menstrual periods or heavy menstrual bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Abnormal uterine bleeding (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a postmenopausal woman, <strong>any vaginal bleeding</strong> is considered abnormal, even if it is only one drop of blood. This is especially true in women who are not taking postmenopausal hormone therapy.</p><p/><p>Women who take postmenopausal hormone therapy often have some vaginal bleeding in the first few months of treatment. However, if you are taking postmenopausal hormone therapy and you have bleeding, you should check with your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOMETRIAL CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse might recommend testing for endometrial cancer if you have abnormal bleeding. The most commonly used tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test that is done in the office, called endometrial biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test that is done as a day surgery, called hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilation-and-curettage-d-and-c-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Dilation and curettage (D and C) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>These tests take a sample of tissue from the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium. A doctor will examine the tissue with a microscope to see if there are signs of cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once endometrial cancer is diagnosed, the next step is to determine its stage. Staging is a system used to describe the spread of a cancer. Endometrial cancer's stage is based on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How deeply the cancer has invaded the muscle wall of the uterus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether there are signs that the cancer has spread to other organs on a physical exam, MRI of the abdomen and pelvis, chest X-ray, or other imaging tests</p><p/><p>Endometrial cancer stages range from stage I (cancer has not invaded beyond the lining of the uterus) to stage IV (the cancer has spread to distant organs, such as the liver). In general, lower stage cancers are less aggressive and require less treatment than do higher stage cancers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is usually done to determine how deeply the cancer has invaded the muscle wall of the uterus. At the same time, the cancer can be treated by removing the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. Surgery is done in an operating room with general anesthesia, and most women stay in the hospital for several days after the surgery.</p><p>Surgery can be done by laparoscopy (through small skin incisions in the abdomen and using a camera), if this type of surgery is possible, or through a larger skin incision in the abdomen. This is called a laparotomy. The choice between laparotomy and laparoscopy depends on your situation and you and your surgeon's preferences.</p><p>During the surgery, the following procedures are performed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The organs are examined within the pelvis and abdomen for signs of cancer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The uterus and ovaries are removed (called total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). This procedure is described in detail in a separate article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Abdominal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid from the abdomen and any abnormal tissue in the pelvis or abdomen are evaluated to determine whether the cancer has spread outside of the uterus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lymph nodes surrounding the uterus are examined. One of the first places that endometrial cancer spreads to is the lymph nodes. Swelling of the legs (lymphedema) affects approximately 5 to 40 percent of women with endometrial cancer following removal of lymph nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">If surgery is not possible</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If surgery is too risky, such as in elderly women and women with serious medical problems, radiation therapy alone may be recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS THAT GUIDE TREATMENT OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of endometrial cancer depends on how likely it is that the cancer will come back after treatment. This risk is based on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stage of the cancer, which is based on what is found during surgery (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Tumor staging'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How aggressive the tumor appears (called the tumor grade) when the tissue is examined under a microscope. High-grade tumors are usually faster growing and more likely to spread than low-grade tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What type of cells make up the tumor (called cell histology). Some cell types have a higher risk of coming back after treatment.</p><p/><p>Depending on these characteristics, the cancer is said to have a low, intermediate, or high risk of coming back after surgery. These designations are used to decide which treatments, if any, are needed after surgery to decrease the risk of the cancer coming back.</p><p>Endometrial cancer treatment is discussed in a separate article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-cancer-treatment-after-surgery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Endometrial cancer treatment after surgery (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2064983208\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOMETRIAL CANCER AND RISK OF OTHER CANCERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some individuals with endometrial cancer are at risk for having Lynch syndrome, a genetic disorder that predisposes towards various types of cancers, including endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer. Patients who are diagnosed with endometrial cancer should discuss with their clinician about whether they should be tested for Lynch syndrome. Patients whose tumors display certain high-risk microscopic features, as well as those who developed endometrial cancer prior to age 50 years, and those with a concerning personal or family history of cancer should be referred for genetic counseling and testing for Lynch syndrome. Patients who are found to have Lynch syndrome are screened for Lynch-associated cancers on a routine basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY AND ENDOMETRIAL CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although cancer is more common in postmenopausal women, it can develop in younger women. A woman with endometrial cancer who would like to have a child in the future should discuss treatment options with her doctor.
