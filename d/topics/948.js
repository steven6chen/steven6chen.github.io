These abnormal blood vessels can also be called &quot;angioectasias,&quot; &quot;arteriovenous malformations,&quot; or &quot;AVMs.&quot;</p><p>The gastrointestinal tract, or &quot;GI tract,&quot; includes all the organs in the body that digest food (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). In angiodysplasia of the GI tract, blood vessels along the GI tract become abnormal. This condition can lead to problems. When blood vessels are abnormal, they can bleed very easily and people can have bleeding in their GI tract. The medical term for bleeding in the GI tract is a &quot;GI bleed.&quot;</p><p>Angiodysplasia of the GI tract happens most often in older adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18170778\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of angiodysplasia of the GI tract?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend on whether the abnormal blood vessels bleed or not.</p><p>If the abnormal blood vessels do not bleed, people do not have any symptoms. They find out they have the condition after their doctor does tests for another reason.</p><p>If the abnormal blood vessels bleed, people might or might not realize they have a GI bleed. When a GI bleed causes symptoms, it can cause bloody or tar-colored bowel movements. But some people with a GI bleed have no symptoms and don't see any blood. People might not see any blood when the bleeding happens very slowly over time.</p><p>A GI bleed sometimes leads to a condition called &quot;anemia,&quot; which is when the body has too few red blood cells. Anemia can make people feel tired or weak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18170793\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for angiodysplasia of the GI tract?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can do different tests to check for angiodysplasia of the GI tract. The test you have depends on which part of the GI tract your doctor wants to check. The different tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An upper endoscopy &ndash; This procedure lets the doctor look at the lining of your esophagus (the tube from the mouth to the stomach), stomach, and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). During this test, the doctor puts a thin tube with a camera and light on the end into your mouth and down your esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A colonoscopy &ndash; This procedure lets the doctor look at the inside of the large intestine (colon). During this test, the doctor puts a thin tube with a camera and light on the end into your anus and up your rectum and colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A capsule endoscopy &ndash; This test uses a small camera about the size of a pill. You swallow the camera, and it sends pictures of your small intestine to a recording device that you wear on a belt for 8 hours. After the test, the camera leaves your body in a bowel movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan &ndash; A CT scan is an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18170808\"><span class=\"h1\">How is angiodysplasia of the GI tract treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on whether the abnormal blood vessels are bleeding, and if you have anemia.</p><p>In most cases, people only need treatment if the abnormal blood vessels are bleeding or they have anemia. People who do not have bleeding or anemia usually don't need any treatment.</p><p>When treatment is needed, it usually involves a procedure to stop the bleeding. Your doctor can do this procedure during your colonoscopy or upper endoscopy.</p><p>If this procedure doesn't stop the bleeding, your doctor will talk with you about other possible treatments to stop the bleeding. These might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called &quot;angiography&quot; to block the bleeding blood vessel</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called &quot;enteroscopy&quot; &ndash; This is like an upper endoscopy, but the doctor puts the tube further into the small intestine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Most people do not need surgery. But people with a lot of bleeding might need surgery to remove part of their intestine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines &ndash; Certain medicines might help stop the bleeding. But these medicines don't always work and they can have harmful side effects.</p><p/><p>People with anemia or bleeding might also need treatment with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extra iron, which usually comes in pills</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood transfusions &ndash; During a blood transfusion, you will get blood that has been donated by someone else. The donated blood goes into your vein.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18170823\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gi-bleed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: GI bleed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloody-stools-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bloody stools (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-stool-rectal-bleeding-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Blood in the stool (rectal bleeding) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloody-stools-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bloody stools in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
