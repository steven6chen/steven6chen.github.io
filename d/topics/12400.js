Crude rates of disability are rising around the globe with over 700 million years lived with disability (YLDs) in 2010 compared with 583 million in 1990; however, after adjusting for population growth rates of YLDs per 100,000, people have remained largely constant over time, but rise steadily with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. While there is considerable heterogeneity across countries in the dominant causes of disability, in general, the global disease burden has shifted from communicable to noncommunicable diseases, with many countries experiencing increases in age-related conditions and YLDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The most common contributors to YLDs in 2010 included low back pain, major depressive disorder, iron deficiency anemia, neck pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anxiety disorders, migraine, diabetes, and falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The primary purpose of rehabilitation is to enable people to function at the highest possible level despite physical impairment. While rehabilitation may be provided to all age groups, the fastest growing population of persons requiring rehabilitation services is adults over 65 years of age.</p><p>This topic will discuss assessing patients for rehabilitation services and indications for rehabilitation.

ADLs include bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, eating, and continence. IADLs include cooking, cleaning, shopping, transportation, finances, and medication management.</p><p>Disability has a tremendous impact on the quality of life of individuals and their caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Disability also impacts health care utilization; increasing the number of ADL disabilities from zero to six results in a sevenfold increase in health care costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Multiple chronic conditions are associated with increasing levels of disability, and the proportion of older adults in the United States reporting multiple chronic conditions is increasing over time, with 17.4 percent reporting four or more chronic conditions in 2008 compared with 11.7 percent in 1998, although, the proportion reporting an ADL or IADL disability has remained stable at approximately 25 percent over this period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In younger populations, disability frequently arises suddenly from a catastrophic illness or accident. In older persons with limited functional reserve, lesser stressors such as a fall, infection, or hospitalization may precipitate disability. In a prospective cohort study of previously nondisabled community dwelling adults newly admitted to a nursing facility after a hospitalization, only one-third were able to return home at or above their previous level of function, while 46 percent returned home with new disability and 27 percent remained in the nursing home with disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Older adults also frequently present with subacute onset of disability and no clear precipitating event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Disability resulting from multiple chronic conditions is dynamic, with patients' abilities and needs changing over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Observational studies suggest that while many disability episodes are brief, lasting one to two months, these events identify individuals who are at risk for recurrent or progressive decline in function and require evaluation and intervention to prevent disability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disability assessment and determination in the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The World Health Organization's International Classification of Function, Disability, and Health (ICF) model describes disability as arising from the interaction between physical impairments resulting from health conditions and contextual factors that impact the person's ability to adapt to those impairments, such as social support and environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Models for the development of disability are discussed separately.

In patients with multiple health conditions, it is frequently impossible (and unnecessary) to identify a primary cause or trigger for the disability. Rather, identifying all contributing conditions, impairments, and contextual factors and addressing these factors with appropriate interventions is the most effective means of reducing functional dependence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4720482\"><span class=\"h2\">Characterize the disability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to clearly describe the disability, including its onset, time course, and impact on patient and caregivers. In addition, attention should be paid to soliciting the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms to help identify the affected organ systems or musculoskeletal components and potential underlying conditions, eg:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sudden loss of function with an acute hip fracture versus insidious loss of function with osteoarthritis of the hip</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compensatory strategies in use by the patient and caregiver to help guide choices in treatment interventions, eg:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Physical (eg, use of assistive device),</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Environmental (eg, moving bedroom downstairs), and</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Social (eg, Meals on Wheels, family support)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4720488\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify impairments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial history and physical should focus on identifying the organ systems involved in causing the functional decline or disability (eg, musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary).

The role of physical and occupational therapists is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of geriatric rehabilitation: Program components and settings for rehabilitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Social work and nursing frequently are helpful for addressing contextual issues and providing patient self-management training or caregiver support. Nutrition and pharmacy professionals are critical when relevant impairments are identified. When available, geriatric evaluation and management clinics can provide such interdisciplinary care for older adults with disability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-geriatric-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive geriatric assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4720530\"><span class=\"h1\">REHABILITATION FOR SPECIFIC CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Types of rehabilitation for several conditions that commonly causing late-life disability are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F107589\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107589 \">table 7</a>), which includes the frequency, care duration, and settings in which that care is provided.</p><p>Rehabilitation in the older population is made more challenging by the common need to provide rehabilitation care across multiple settings. As an example, for patients with hip fractures or strokes, rehabilitation may start while the patient is in the acute hospital and then transition to intensive inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing facility, home health, and outpatient care over the course of the patient's recovery. Transitions across multiple locations increase the risk of multiple problems, including errors in medication orders, discontinuity in rehabilitation interventions, patient confusion, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530614396\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4720536\"><span class=\"h3\">Stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A stroke can affect functionality across diverse organ systems (eg, speech, vision, strength, coordination, balance), and multidisciplinary rehabilitation is the norm. Stroke rehabilitation may involve a wide spectrum of rehabilitation providers and care settings, ranging from the neurologic intensive care unit to outpatient clinics and the patient's home. Meta-analyses show benefit from early intensive rehabilitation, particularly in an organized, coordinated setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Stroke rehabilitation may encompass a wide array of interventions, ranging from exercise to cognitive retraining to learning compensatory strategies.</p><p>Methods for stroke rehabilitation are advancing rapidly, facilitated in part by new technology, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which provides information on the neurologic effects of rehabilitation and the effectiveness of novel methods to enhance delivery of exercise-related interventions. For example, a systematic review of randomized trials evaluated a variety of interventions for improving upper limb function after stroke and found some evidence for the effectiveness of constraint-induced movement therapy, mental practice, mirror therapy, and a high dose of repetitive task practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, the review identified insufficient high-quality studies to allow comparison of specific kinds of interventions.</p><p>Evidence-based guidelines from the American Heart Association and the Veterans Health Affairs address early stroke-related care and decision-making for rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Stroke outcomes are affected by the underlying health conditions that caused the stroke (eg, hypertension, atrial fibrillation) and by comorbidity related to the stroke (eg, dysphagia causing malnutrition). Patients with significant physical or functional impairment should receive intensive rehabilitation if they are able to tolerate three hours per day of therapy. For patients who are unable to tolerate intensive rehabilitation, the best location for providing rehabilitation is determined individually and depends on the extent of their functional impairment and available social support.</p><p>Additional guidance includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early patient assessment should be carried out using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale and should also include assessment of risk factors for recurrent stroke (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation) and stroke-related complications (eg, deep vein thrombosis [DVT], cognitive dysfunction, dysphagia and malnutrition, mobility impairment).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient and caregiver should be involved in decisions in all phases of the rehabilitation process, in turn improving participation in the rehabilitation processes and outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rehabilitation therapy should be initiated as soon as possible, starting in the acute care setting, including early mobilization in the intensive care unit, as tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The selection of the post-acute setting for rehabilitative care is critical. It should be based on the patient's degree of dependency in activities of daily living (ADLs) (eg, patients with minimal functional impairment may be managed at home with home health or outpatient follow-up, patients with greater degrees of functional impairment benefit from inpatient rehabilitation), ability to tolerate intensive rehabilitation (eg, patients must be able to tolerate at least three hours per day of therapy to qualify for intensive inpatient rehabilitation and other patients are best managed in a skilled nursing facility), and ability to participate in rehabilitation and overall prognosis (eg, patients whose condition limits participation in rehabilitation or who have a poor prognosis for recovery may be best cared for at home or in a skilled nursing facility with medical follow-up).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-acute rehabilitation should be in a coordinated multidisciplinary inpatient setting or with an organized team approach in the home health or outpatient setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rehabilitation should be continued until the patient reaches a plateau, but the optimal setting for care may change depending on the patient's response to rehabilitation and neurologic recovery.</p><p/><p>Evidence-based reviews pertaining to diverse aspects of stroke rehabilitation have been developed by the <a href=\"http://www.ebrsr.com/evidence-review&amp;token=6aXo3x7zFy8UVopqAlr6rdmDg5c+ZDWSDpOHIVn/4L7MMzbhI8ZttPRdCd5Eqqu1&amp;TOPIC_ID=16853\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Canadian Partnership for Stroke Recovery</a>.</p><p>Tele-rehabilitation is a promising modality to deliver rehabilitation to patients with residual impairment despite standard rehabilitation or for patients who lack access to standard rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

Comprehensive rehabilitation and a multidisciplinary team are needed to address problems with weakness, mobility, self-care, and potential complex physiologic effects of the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The presence of comorbid conditions would determine the aggressiveness of the therapies and their optimal delivery site, considering the impact of comorbidity on the patient's probable functional outcomes and ability to tolerate intensive therapy or cooperate with the therapists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538087507\"><span class=\"h4\">Parkinsonism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to an acute injury, Parkinsonism is slowly progressive and response to PT is modest and short-lived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Improvement in physical function largely relates to treating concomitant deconditioning <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> use of compensatory strategies; evidence on the effectiveness of speech therapy for Parkinsonism is of insufficient quality to make definitive recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Typically, rehabilitation for Parkinsonism is provided by a single discipline and focused on a particular problem, with interventions targeted towards compensatory strategies and actions that the patient will be able to continue at home that may help avert deconditioning (eg, home exercise programs).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3152001554\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide variety of musculoskeletal conditions are treated with rehabilitation services. Typical treatment is by a single discipline and as outpatient, but this may vary depending on comorbid conditions and patient residence (eg, institutional residence, homebound). The number of visits provided varies according to the nature of the condition (eg, severity) and other comorbid conditions (eg, cognitive impairment).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4720548\"><span class=\"h3\">Hip fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific guidelines are lacking for hip fracture rehabilitation. Evidence shows that early and frequent PT helps improve outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], yet prolonged PT may be required to reach maximal functional outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Post-fracture rehabilitation is provided across the continuum of care, starting in the acute hospital. After discharge from acute care, hip fracture rehabilitation commonly is provided in skilled nursing facilities and inpatient rehabilitation facilities, but there is little evidence to show greater benefit from one inpatient location or the other, after accounting for length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Some evidence suggests that home rehabilitation, compared with inpatient rehabilitation, may have greater benefit. The choice of location largely depends on local availability and comorbid conditions. Patients who have multiple comorbid conditions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who cannot participate in intensive rehabilitation are best served in a skilled nursing facility, while patients who can tolerate intensive rehabilitation may do well in an inpatient rehabilitation facility or at home with a combination of home health followed by outpatient rehabilitation.</p><p>Hip fractures predominantly affect mobility, but the impaired mobility affects self-care activities that require mobility and lower extremity flexibility, such as dressing, toilet transfers, and use of the <span class=\"nowrap\">tub/shower</span>. While the predominant discipline involved in hip fracture rehabilitation is PT, OT also is involved, albeit for a shorter period of time. In a systematic review, there was a suggestion that multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation for older patients improved short-term outcomes compared with usual care, but results were not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Hip fractures in older adults are commonly associated with other common geriatric problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive impairment impacts recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Loss of functional reserve is thought to explain the observation that older adults experience more complications (eg, delirium) and recover more slowly from an injury or illness than younger persons. Frailty is the manifestation of decreased functional reserve that is observed clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In older persons with limited functional reserve, lesser stressors may precipitate disability or there may be subacute onset with no clear precipitating event. Disability resulting from multiple chronic conditions is dynamic, with patients' abilities and needs changing over time. (See <a href=\"#H456683377\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology of disability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic approach to assessing late-life disability focuses on identifying all contributing conditions, impairments, and contextual factors and addressing these factors with appropriate interventions. In this assessment, the clinician(s) should describe the disability, including its onset, time course, and impact on patient and caregivers; identify associated symptoms; and identify contextual factors that may impact the impairment. (See <a href=\"#H4720476\" class=\"local\">'Approach to assessing late-life disability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A practical management plan, developed with the patient and family, identifies strategies to enhance functional abilities and decrease functional demands. Maximizing capacity (functional ability) may include initiating or discontinuing medication, nutritional and exercise intervention, and providing prosthetics (eg, hearing aid). Decreasing demands may involve assistive devices (eg, walkers), environmental modification (eg, improved lighting), increasing human help, and adaptive training. Implementing a plan to reduce late-life disability requires coordination among multiple professionals, the patient, and caregivers.

The most appropriate rehabilitation strategies need to be based on the specific conditions that are believed to be causing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exacerbating specific functional impairments, the acuity of the various conditions, and the patient's response to prior efforts at rehabilitation.
