A minority of patients with this disorder may survive untreated for many years. However, in more patients, MCL assumes a more virulent character, akin to that of an aggressive NHL variant.</p><p>The initial treatment of MCL will be discussed here. Clinical and pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately, as is the treatment of relapsed or refractory MCL.

Clinicians must always be alert to their potential presence, and be prepared to deal with them urgently and effectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Oncologic emergencies'</a>.)</p><p>Emergencies that are more common in patients with MCL include hyperleukocytosis and intestinal obstruction or intussusception: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is common in MCL, occasionally presenting with multiple intestinal polyposis and intestinal obstruction or intussusception.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis in hematologic malignancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While most patients with MCL who do not begin therapy will die of their disease within a few years, a small proportion, increasingly better defined, may remain stable for years. These occasional patients with low tumor burden (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>), low-risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 2</a>) disease may have an indolent course, managed by observation, splenectomy, or treatment with alkylating agents analogous to the treatment of patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of limited stage (I/II) follicular lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While we know that a small proportion of these patients will progress slowly, it is very difficult to identify these patients at the time of diagnosis. As an example, a retrospective analysis of 97 patients with asymptomatic MCL treated at a single institution found that approximately one-third of patients were observed for more than three months before initiating therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Treatment was postponed for more than one year in 14 patients and more than five years in three patients. This suggests that some patients with MCL may have an indolent course; however, on multivariate analysis, clinical characteristics including age, stage, World Health Organization performance status, extranodal status, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level were not able to predict which patients would progress slowly. Clinicians differ in their management of patients expected to have a more indolent course. While some advocate watch and wait, others feel this is the group that might benefit from aggressive therapies. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> below.)</p><p>Pathologic features may provide some insight into which patients will be more likely to progress. Expression of Ki-67 (a measure of proliferative activity), SOX11 (a transcription factor), and TP53 (a tumor suppressor) may have prognostic value in MCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/6-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-12</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ki-67:</strong> A correlative study evaluated the prognostic value of Ki-67 in 508 patients treated on prospective trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A Ki-67 index &lt;30 percent was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), independent of the Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI) score. Five-year OS for those with a Ki-67 &lt;10 percent, 10 to 30 percent, and &gt;30 percent were estimated to be 73, 75, and 41 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>SOX11:</strong> Overexpression of SOX11 has been associated with a more aggressive clinical course. Up to 20 percent of MCL develops from antigen-experienced SOX11-negative B cells. This variant typically involves the peripheral blood, bone marrow, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> often spleen (while sparing lymph nodes), and this &quot;leukemic&quot; variant is often clinically indolent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TP53:</strong> High levels of TP53 expression predicted inferior OS and shorter time to treatment failure (TTF) in multivariate analysis of 365 patients treated on prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Compared with tumors with low TP53 expression and adjusting for MIPI score and Ki-67 index, hazard ratios for OS and TTF were 2.1 and 2.0, respectively, in patients with high TP53 expression.</p><p/><p>These research observations have not yet been validated in routine clinical practice.</p><p>In our clinical experience, those with more indolent tumors comprise a small percentage of patients with MCL and typically present with lymphocytosis, a few enlarged lymph nodes, splenomegaly, SOX11 negativity, and a Ki-67 index &lt;30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>].</p><p>Despite this, the long-term outlook for most patients with MCL is unfavorable with median OS times with treatment of 8 to 10 years. There is no evidence that currently available treatment programs are curative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, patients with advanced or symptomatic disease are treated with combination chemotherapy to decrease tumor bulk and alleviate symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pretreatment evaluation both determines the bulk of disease and provides information about the individual's comorbidities that are likely to have an impact on treatment options. In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform the following pretreatment studies in patients with MCL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and uric acid.

Bone marrow biopsy may be omitted in patients with normal peripheral blood counts (ie, no cytopenias) and for those not undergoing active therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform a lumbar puncture on patients with the MCL blastic variant or those with central nervous system symptoms. When performed, cerebrospinal fluid should be sent for both cytology and flow cytometry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Integrated whole body positron emission tomography with computed tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span> is the preferred pretreatment imaging study. MCL is considered a typically FDG-avid tumor such that involved areas should show activity on PET scan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Routine imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy are performed for patients with gastrointestinal symptoms or findings on physical examination suggestive of gastrointestinal involvement. We limit endoscopy in asymptomatic patients to those clinical situations in which identification of involvement would change management (eg, stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> disease).

A baseline evaluation may not be necessary for those under the age of 65 who lack cardiac risk factors.

While occasional patients with low stage, low-risk disease may have an indolent course that can be observed initially, combination chemotherapy plus immunotherapy (ie, chemoimmunotherapy) remains the main treatment modality. Surgery is usually not employed, but may be of value in patients with MCL involving the gastrointestinal tract presenting with bowel obstruction or uncontrollable bleeding, usually from extensive colonic polyposis. Likewise, radiation therapy is usually reserved for palliation. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may be considered for patients with relapsed or refractory disease, ideally in the context of a clinical trial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-mantle-cell-lymphoma#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is a diversity of clinical practice and ambiguity surrounding the preferred treatment approach for patients with MCL. Whenever possible, young, otherwise healthy patients with advanced, symptomatic MCL should be referred to a center offering a <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/&amp;token=YbJELcAW9G3aZfZrjTwglubdGkNLI6vF+UUqouKTYUezNDuyrLCVJ8CPUNOYDvHP&amp;TOPIC_ID=4719\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">clinical trial</a>. </p><p>Outside of a clinical trial, treatment options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conventional chemoimmunotherapy (eg, BR, R-CHOP) alone or followed by maintenance </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> &ndash; This approach is appropriate for patients who are not candidates for autologous HCT. Although it is not curative, a majority of patients will attain a complete response. Maintenance rituximab appears to prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and may improve overall survival (OS) in patients treated with R-CHOP, but not those treated with BR. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Conventional chemoimmunotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H247521657\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conventional chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous HCT and maintenance </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> &ndash; This is our preferred treatment for patients who are eligible for HCT. The addition of HCT improves PFS and may improve OS. Non-randomized studies suggest that this approach is as effective and less toxic than more intensive chemoimmunotherapy (R-Hyper-CVAD). The benefit of HCT appears to be greatest among those in first complete remission (CR) after no more than two chemotherapy regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The incorporation of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> (eg, R-CHOP plus R-DHAP) prior to HCT improves PFS, but not OS. (See <a href=\"#H1967069\" class=\"local\">'Autologous transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intensive chemoimmunotherapy (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">R-Hyper-CVAD/</strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a><strong>/MTX)</span> alone</strong> &ndash; Non-randomized, single-center trials suggest improved survival in young adults (&lt;60 years) treated with <span class=\"nowrap\">R-Hyper-CVAD/cytarabine/MTX</span> when compared with those treated with conventional chemotherapy alone. However, studies in cooperative group settings have <strong>not</strong> confirmed these benefits and have demonstrated significant toxicity with this regimen. Importantly, the toxicity excludes its use in older adults (ie, &gt;65 years) and limits its use in individuals between the ages of 60 and 65 years. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Hyper-CVAD/cytarabine/MTX'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conventional chemoimmunotherapy plus involved-field radiation therapy</strong> &ndash; Patients with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> disease may achieve prolonged PFS and local control following abbreviated chemoimmunotherapy (eg, three cycles) plus involved-field radiation therapy. In a registry analysis, the administration of radiation therapy to 43 patients (3.6 percent of total patients with all stages) with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> disease resulted in an estimated OS at three years of 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>These approaches have never been directly compared in a randomized trial. While some prospective, non-randomized trials have suggested longer median OS rates with a more aggressive treatment approach (either <span class=\"nowrap\">R-Hyper-CVAD/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>/MTX</span> or HCT), these are also associated with a higher incidence of treatment-related toxicities. The uncertainty surrounding the benefits of more aggressive therapy was highlighted by a single-institution retrospective analysis of 111 patients with newly diagnosed MCL, 70 percent of whom were treated with conventional chemotherapy (R-CHOP-like or CHOP-like regimens) without HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Median OS was seven years. The three- and five-year OS rates of 86 and 66 percent respectively, were similar to those seen in prospective studies of <span class=\"nowrap\">R-Hyper-CVAD/cytarabine/MTX</span>.</p><p>The evidence supporting these various approaches is described in the following sections. In addition, we offer guidance on the selection of therapy for different patient populations based upon our interpretation of the literature and experience. (See <a href=\"#H4668248\" class=\"local\">'Our treatment approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Role for rituximab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The monoclonal CD20 antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> is known to be beneficial in the initial treatment of several types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including MCL. Initial comparisons with historical controls suggested that rituximab may play a role in the treatment of MCL, while prospective randomized trials have had mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/16,18-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-25</a>].</p><p>A 2007 meta-analysis of the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> plus chemotherapy for patients with indolent NHL or MCL found that patients treated with rituximab plus chemotherapy had superior OS, response, and disease control than patients treated with chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/14,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,26</a>]. However, only three small studies were available for MCL in this study. A subsequent retrospective analysis of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) and Medicare databases of 638 older adults with MCL who received initial chemotherapy with (64 percent) or without rituximab reported that the addition of rituximab was associated with superior median survival (37 versus 27 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. On multivariate analysis, the addition of rituximab was associated with lower rates of both all-cause (hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 95% CI 0.41-0.82) and cancer-specific mortality (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.84) at two years.</p><p>For patients with MCL, we recommend the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to combination chemotherapy rather than chemotherapy alone. This is primarily due to the low risk of toxicity related to the addition of rituximab and a possible but uncertain benefit in OS. Rituximab can be incorporated into either conventional chemotherapy regimens or aggressive treatment programs.</p><p>The role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in maintenance therapy of MCL is discussed below.

We use conventional chemoimmunotherapy for induction in most patients with MCL. Patients who attain an at least partial response following conventional chemoimmunotherapy are considered for consolidation with autologous HCT. However, a CIMBTR database analysis suggests that the best outcome is in first CR after no more than two regimens. Those who are not candidates for HCT may be candidates for maintenance rituximab; however, the efficacy of maintenance rituximab may differ depending upon the induction regimen used.

In contrast, autologous HCT has not demonstrated a benefit in patients initially treated with more intensive chemoimmunotherapy, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">R-Hyper-CVAD/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].
