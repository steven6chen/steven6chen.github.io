A spatula and a separate endocervical brush provide a specimen with more endocervical cells than when only a spatula is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is also slightly better for detecting any grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) than the single broom device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cotton tipped swabs should be avoided because they collect fewer endocervical cells and do not detect CIN as well as other devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. A meta-analysis of 36 randomized trials and six observational studies in women undergoing conventional Pap smears found that the most commonly used spatula (Ayre spatula) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72092\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72092 \">figure 1</a>) collected fewer endocervical cells than spatulas with extended tips (eg, Aylesbury), but both spatula types yielded similar diagnostic results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Sample collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To obtain cells from the cervix:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use the spatula to circumferentially scrape the ectocervix (for liquid-based samples, use a plastic rather than a wooden spatula; wood or plastic is fine for conventional smears) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The slide is then rapidly fixed to avoid air-drying; the usual fixatives are either ethyl ether plus 95 percent ethyl alcohol or 95 percent ethyl alcohol alone. If spray fixatives are used, the spray should be held at least 10 inches away from the slide to prevent disruption of cells by the propellant.</p><p>For liquid-based thin layer cytology, the collecting device is placed into a liquid fixative solution and vigorously swirled or rotated ten times in the solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58546\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58546 \">figure 3</a>). When the liquid is processed by the cytology laboratory, loose cells are trapped onto a filter and then plated in a monolayer onto a glass slide.</p><p>For both methods, cells are obtained from the external surface of the cervix (ectocervix) and the cervical canal (endocervix) to evaluate the transformation zone (squamocolumnar junction), the area at greatest risk for neoplasia.</p><p>An advantage of some liquid-based systems is the ability to use a single specimen for cytology and testing for HPV. With conventional smears, a separate HPV test specimen has to be obtained.

The cobas HPV test differs in that it specifically identifies types 16 and 18 and pools results for 12 other types, and is the only HPV test specifically approved for primary screening rather than for co-testing. Separate tests provide genotyping of types 16 and 18 (or a combined type <span class=\"nowrap\">18/45</span> result) and can be performed as follow-up (or reflex) testing for specimens with a positive high-risk pooled result, but are not used for initial screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H853915922\"><span class=\"h3\">Cervical testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specimens for HPV testing can be collected from the endocervix using a cervical spatula or cervical brush, which is then placed in HPV test transport medium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. With some liquid-based cytology sampling systems, the same specimen can be used for HPV testing and cytology. </p><p>In resource-limited settings, self-collection of an HPV sample by the patient is being used. Women can collect samples from the vagina using a tampon, Dacron or cotton swab, cytobrush, or cervicovaginal lavage.

This testing method may have utility if HPV testing alone (without cervical cytology) is used for cervical cancer screening. The efficacy of urine testing was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 14 studies including 1443 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Most studies used commercial polymerase chain reaction methods, and cervical testing results were used as the reference standard. For detection of high-risk HPV, the sensitivity was 77 percent and specificity was 88 percent. For detection of HPV 16 and 18, sensitivity was 73 percent and specificity was 98 percent. Sensitivity was statistically significantly higher when urine samples were collected as first void compared with random or midstream. Such a test may have potential in large research studies or as an alternative test where routine cervico-vaginal exams are not economically feasible or less likely to be performed due to cultural barriers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional testing that may be performed during examination of the cervix includes:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomonas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is common practice to collect the cytology sample before testing for cervical infection, if indicated.

Liquid-based cytology systems allow testing for cytology, HPV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomonas from a single specimen.

This may be the case if the <strong>uterus is sharply anteverted or retroverted</strong>. In addition, the <strong>vaginal fornices may be obliterated</strong> in women with vaginal atrophy due to menopause or other conditions (eg, prior pelvic radiation, vaginal graft-versus-host disease), and the cervix may not protrude in the usual fashion. In such cases, the clinician should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a bimanual examination to palpate the cervix and identify its location.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improve visualization using patient position. In dorsal lithotomy, the following modifications can be used: (1) Ensure that the patient&rsquo;s legs are sufficiently abducted. The patient may need to move toward the examiner. Care should be taken if the patient has knee or hip mobility issues. (2) Elevate the sacrum by placing an object (bedpan, folded up sheet or towel) under the patient&rsquo;s hips.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirm that the patient has a cervix (some women who have undergone a total hysterectomy do not give an accurate surgical history).</p><p/><p>In women with obliteration of the vaginal fornices, palpation often allows the examiner to differentiate the firm cervical tissue from the surrounding vaginal walls. In addition, with adequate visualization, the external cervical os can usually be identified. </p><p>In women with <strong>cervical stenosis</strong>, it may be difficult to obtain an endocervical sample, thus resulting in an insufficient result. When it is difficult to insert the sampling device into the endocervix, one of the following techniques may facilitate collection of an endocervical sample:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform Pap testing during menses. Menstrual blood often slightly dilates the cervix. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Menses or other genital tract bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grasp the anterior or posterior lip of the cervix with a single-tooth tenaculum. Applying gentle traction will stabilize the cervix and may provide enough counter-tension to insert a sampling device into the external cervical os.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer a para- or intracervical block, and use small mechanical dilators to dilate the cervix.</p><p/><p>Follow-up in women with a Pap test with absence of endocervical <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/transformation</span> zone component is discussed separately.

The interpretation of cytologic smears is subject to considerable inter-observer variability, particularly in the case of non-diagnostic squamous and glandular atypias (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS] and atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In some settings, cytotechnologists <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> automated slide interpretation devices perform initial review of the cytology slides to identify a subgroup of slides for subsequent evaluation by a cytopathologist. This subgroup consists of slides with specific abnormal characteristics.</p><p>One example of an automated slide interpretation system is the ThinPrep Imaging System, which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for primary screening of slides. This system uses programmed algorithms to review each slide for areas of most concern. If abnormalities are found, the whole slide is reviewed by a cytopathologist. In one study, use of this device increased detection of high grade squamous lesions (HSIL) by 38 percent and low grade squamous lesions (LSIL) by 46 percent compared with manual screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In another study, use of the imager resulted in fewer unsatisfactory slides than with conventional cytology (1.8 versus 3.1 percent) and better detection of HSIL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although promising, the clinical effectiveness of automated systems and their role in cervical cancer screening have not been definitively established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In the United States, quality assurance regulations require that laboratories rescreen 10 percent of randomly selected cervical cytology smears that were originally interpreted as negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

We suggest performing rather than deferring the test, unless the blood cannot be cleaned from the cervix. Cleaning the cervix with a large cotton swab will remove obscuring blood and appears to have a minimal or no effect on sample cellularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>If there is obscuring blood, conventional Pap smears are more likely to be unsatisfactory for interpretation than liquid-based methods because liquid-based techniques filter out red blood cells.

The rate of unsatisfactory smears was 23 percent during cycle days 0 to 3 versus 2 percent for the remainder of the cycle.</p><p>For liquid-based Pap tests, timing during the menstrual cycle does not appear to have a clinically significant effect on cytologic results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. This was illustrated by a large study in which 5060 women with initial cytology showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low grade squamous lesions (LSIL) had over 20,000 liquid-based Pap tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The phase of the menstrual cycle did not have a significant effect on the rate of unsatisfactory specimens. Although the detection of LSIL or more severe abnormalities was slightly higher in the mid- versus early or late cycle (mid-cycle: 20 percent, early and late cycle: 18 percent), this difference is unlikely to be clinically significant.</p><p>HPV testing results are not affected by bleeding, although some data suggest that detection of high risk varies with the phase of the menstrual cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Interval between Pap tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Pap test may need to be repeated after a brief interval if the sample is unsatisfactory or at the time of colposcopy. A short interval between Pap tests (15 to 30 days) does not appear to affect sensitivity for detection of cervical neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>The concern about a short interval between Pap tests is based on the hypothesis that previous scraping for cytology will remove the most superficial layer of cervical cells, where a potential abnormality is most likely to occur. It will then take a period of time (generally estimated as up to two months) for the superficial cells to regenerate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Thus, if sampling is performed too soon, the underlying cells may be sampled and appear normal, yielding a false negative test.</p><p>The most informative study of the optimum interval between Pap smears evaluated liquid-based Pap tests and HPV testing results in 5055 women with initial Pap tests that showed either ASCUS or LSIL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Sensitivity of repeat specimens was assessed by comparing cytology with histology in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or carcinoma. The interval from initial to repeat Pap test in these women was 8 to 184 days. Adequacy of the sample did not appear to be affected, since cellularity of the sample and HPV viral load did not vary with Pap intervals. In addition, Pap test interval (15 to 120 days) did not significantly affect the finding of abnormal cytology. In fact, the likelihood of a Pap result of LSIL was higher after a shorter versus a longer interval (&le;30 days [30 percent] versus &gt;120 days [20 percent]); this likely represents regression of LSIL with time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Gel lubricants and other contaminants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contaminants, such as gel lubricant, vaginal discharge, semen, spermicide, or intravaginal medications, have been thought to affect cervical sampling. On a conventional smear, the concern is that these may make the smear thick and difficult to read.</p><p>If large amounts of vaginal contaminants are present, the discharge can be removed gently with a large cotton swab without interfering with cytology results. Routine removal of a small amount of discharge or other contaminants is unnecessary.</p><p>Gel lubricant on the speculum or on an examiner's hand before a Pap test is performed is commonly thought to interfere with the results of cervical cytology. Some lubricants, particularly those that include carbomers or carbopol polymers may interfere with sample interpretation. Clinicians should check with their cytology laboratory for approved lubricants. </p><p>In general, studies have not shown an adverse impact of lubricants on cervical cytology interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. This was well illustrated by two large studies (n = 3460 and n = 8534) in which the speculum used to access the cervix was lubricated with either a water-soluble gel or water prior to performing a conventional Pap smear; type of lubricant was randomized by clinic or by month in which the test was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Rates of unsatisfactory smears were similar for both groups (gel: 1.1 and 1.4 percent; water: 1.5 and 1.3 percent). One of these studies also evaluated whether the cytologic diagnosis varied with use of gel; there were no differences in the detection rates of each type of cervical abnormality with use of gel.</p><p>These studies used conventional Pap smears, and it is not certain whether their results can be generalized to liquid-based cytology. However, it is plausible that thin layer cytology is less likely than conventional smears to be affected by gel contaminants, since contaminants are filtered out of the sample during processing. While more study is needed to confirm that gel lubricants do not interfere with liquid-based Pap tests, the existing data suggest no effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>As discussed above, testing for Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis cervical infection is often performed concurrently with cervical cytology. Many clinicians avoid use of gel lubricants prior to testing for these bacteria, since some lubricants are bacteriostatic (eg, those containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate). However, one of the studies described above also evaluated DNA probe testing in 5535 women in whom gel or water was used to lubricate the speculum prior to testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. No significant differences were found between groups in the detection rate of chlamydia (1.5 percent in both groups); the gonorrhea infection rate was too low to analyze. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no data regarding the effect of discharge, semen, or intravaginal medications on cervical cytology interpretation. Studies of use of nonoxynol-9 spermicide have had conflicting results regarding cervical cytology changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. The spermicide nonoxynol-9 is not active against HPV, but detergents, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), do inactivate HPV, and a <span class=\"nowrap\">spermicide/SDS</span> combination could be useful in preventing HPV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal intercourse, douching, and tampon use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women are typically advised to refrain from vaginal activities (eg, douching, tampon use, sexual intercourse) during the 48 hours prior to a Pap test. Advising patients to avoid vaginal activities may be cumbersome to clinicians and make timely scheduling of Pap tests difficult for patients. There are few data that directly assess the effect of vaginal activities on the ability of cervical cytology to detect cervical neoplasia.</p><p>Vaginal intercourse and its effect on cervical cytology have not been studied. However, a study of HPV testing in which women performed self-sampling with synthetic polyester swabs or a tampon found no effect on HPV detection when vaginal intercourse occurred within 48 hours of sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This was a small study, and the data cannot be generalized to clinician-performed testing in women who have had recent vaginal intercourse prior to Pap testing. Although it is possible that HPV detected in cytology samples following recent sexual activity could be derived from the male partner, this should not alter the standard management algorithm. Further study is needed to evaluate the effect of vaginal intercourse on cervical cytology or HPV testing.</p><p>Douching did not affect sensitivity of HPV testing in a study of 132 women (sensitivity was 98 percent before douching; 96 percent after douching); results of the effect of douching on cytology results were not reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. More data are needed to address the effect of douching on cervical cytology and HPV testing.</p><p>There are no data regarding tampon use or barrier contraception and cervical cytology or HPV testing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194665263\"><span class=\"h2\">Postmenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postmenopausal women are more likely to have a cervical cytology specimen that has an absent endocervical or transformation zone component <span class=\"nowrap\">(ECC/TZ)</span>. This may be the result of hypoestrogenism. In such cases, we follow the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelines for an absent <span class=\"nowrap\">ECC/TZ</span> Pap test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F89353\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89353 \">algorithm 1</a>). If HPV testing was not done with the cytology, the preferred approach is to perform HPV testing.

In our practice, for postmenopausal women with absent <span class=\"nowrap\">ECC/TZ,</span> we do not routinely prescribe vaginal estrogen and repeat the Pap test after a short course of this therapy. The exceptions to this are women in whom the previous Pap test showed absent <span class=\"nowrap\">ECC/TZ</span> or atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, HPV-negative. In either of those cases we prescribe a six week course of vaginal estrogen and then repeat the Pap test.
