Early ischemia due to graft occlusion, the technical aspects of percutaneous coronary intervention to treat saphenous vein graft stenosis, and determinants of long-term outcome after CABG are discussed separately.

In more contemporary reports, revascularization rates have come from studies which compare SVG to arterial grafts, CABG to PCI, or graft disease to native vessel disease. For example, in the SYNTAX trial that compared CABG to PCI in patients with three-vessel or left main disease, the rate of repeat revascularization at three years was 11 percent in the CABG group (and 21 percent in the PCI group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Late recurrent angina can occur with the development of stenotic lesions in both saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) and arterial grafts. The need for repeat revascularization, and presumably the frequency of recurrent angina, is reduced with arterial grafts, since long-term patency is much higher compared to SVGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In a report that compared 2306 patients who underwent CABG with an internal thoracic artery (ITA) graft to the left anterior descending artery (alone or with one or more SVGs) to 3625 patients who received only SVGs, the 10-year rates of freedom from cardiac reoperation were 94.4 and 90.1 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Two studies performed before the routine use of arterial grafting found that SVG disease, as opposed to new native artery disease, was the cause of late recurrent angina in 54 and 80 percent of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In contrast, progression of native disease is most often the cause of late recurrent angina in patients who had received an ITA graft. This was illustrated in an analysis from the BARI trial of CABG versus PCI in patients with stable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. On repeat coronary angiography at five years, 82 patients who underwent CABG showed evidence of increased jeopardized myocardium; progression of disease in previously untreated vessels accounted for two-thirds of this increase in myocardium at risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703118136\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of late recurrent angina correlates with male sex, increasing age, and risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

These patients often have symptoms similar to those present before CABG. However, a different presentation (including differing characteristics of pain or symptoms of exercise intolerance or dyspnea instead of pain) may occur, and clinicians should have a relatively low threshold for considering recurrent myocardial ischemia in a patient with prior CABG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia#H358110146\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angina pectoris: Chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>While a physical examination directed at the cardiovascular system should be performed in any patient with a suspicion of recurrent angina, it cannot confirm the diagnosis of recurrent angina. Alternative causes of chest pain, such as chest wall tenderness or a herpes zoster rash can be found. A broader discussion of use of the physical examination in adults with chest pain is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2201616\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late recurrent angina after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is diagnosed when a patient with symptoms consistent with angina is found to have evidence of myocardial ischemia on stress testing with imaging, significant obstructive coronary artery lesions on coronary arteriography, or evidence of an acute coronary syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Acute coronary syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Although the history may be strongly suspicious for recurrent angina, we recommend confirming the suspicion with diagnostic testing. As these patients have a high pretest probability of obstructive coronary artery disease, a positive test will likely confirm the diagnosis. Such testing will also provide prognostic information, which should be used to help formulate a reasonable management strategy. </p><p>We recommend obtaining a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in all patients as soon as recurrent angina is suspected; it should be compared to prior ECGs. New findings of ST-segment or T wave changes representing ischemia, Q waves, bundle branch block, or arrhythmias should raise the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-st-and-t-wave-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: ST and T wave changes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;</a>.) ACS should be suspected in patients with symptoms of myocardial ischemia and one or more of these ECG abnormalities. For patients with possible ACS, including unstable angina, we recommend urgent coronary arteriography, as they may require urgent revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H703120015\" class=\"local\">'Indications for revascularization'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who have a stable presentation, including a stable ECG, we recommend stress testing with imaging (either nuclear or echocardiographic). Such testing can accurately detect graft stenosis, even in patients with atypical symptoms, and can effectively localize the stenosis in some cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease#H184270461\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Our approach to diagnostic stress testing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization#H793760126\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of stress testing after coronary revascularization&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of symptomatic patients'</a>.)</p><p>Similar to patients without prior revascularization, any patient whose stress test results suggest a large area of myocardium at risk, or other high risk features, should be considered for diagnostic coronary angiography. The rationale for this recommendation is that the presence of a high grade lesion in a bypass graft(s) or in an unbypassed vessel(s), particularly the left anterior descending artery, supplying a large area of myocardium may be an indication for revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Indications for revascularization&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It should be confirmed that patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) are receiving appropriate secondary prevention therapies, including the prescription of antiplatelet and statin therapy, routine exercise (and referral to cardiac rehabilitation programs in some patients), glycemic and blood pressure control, and smoking cessation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients in whom repeat revascularization is not felt to be necessary, many can have their symptoms controlled with use of these preventative strategies as well as with the use of antianginal medication. In general, we suggest starting with an antianginal regimen that was previously effective for the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Overview of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following discussion will present the indications for revascularization and outcomes with either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or repeat CABG. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703120015\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with prior CABG, revascularization with either CABG or PCI is indicated to either improve survival or symptoms, similar to the broad population of patients with coronary artery disease. The following discussion applies to patients with new lesions in either native vessels or bypass grafts, unless otherwise specified.</p><p>We suggest repeat revascularization for the following groups of stable patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those for whom revascularization is likely to improve survival. Similar to patients who have not previously undergone CABG, this benefit is likely limited to patients with obstruction of blood flow to the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) territory and demonstrable extensive anterior ischemia on noninvasive testing or significant disease in multiple other vessels. This may occur in patients in whom the LAD was never bypassed or in whom there is a significant stenosis of an arterial or venous graft. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of significant proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disease&quot;, section on 'Indications for revascularization'</a>.) <br/><br/>The lack of benefit of revascularization in patients without significant proximal LAD obstruction was demonstrated in an observational study of over 4600 patients with prior CABG who had a patent left internal thoracic artery (LITA) bypass graft to the LAD but significant disease in another territory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There was no significant difference in mortality during 20-year follow-up between those who continued with medical therapy and those who received either CABG or PCI. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with bothersome angina after a trial of medical therapy. Revascularization may be undertaken if there is a reasonable likelihood of procedural success and the patient understands the possibility of recurrent angina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with stable angina but certain anatomic configurations in the previously bypassed graft(s). In general, we prefer elective stenting even for stable patients who have vein graft stenosis &gt;70 percent due to the increased risk for progression to occlusion over time and the poor outcomes for intervention after total occlusion. <br/><br/>Patients with patulous saphenous vein grafts containing large amounts of particulate debris may need to be considered for reoperation CABG if the combination of rheolytic thrombectomy, aspiration thrombectomy, and distal protection is unlikely to lead to a good outcome. Other patients with early, recurrent in-stent restenosis in bypassed grafts may elect to have repeat bypass surgery after evaluation by a cardiac surgeon and an interventional cardiologist.</p><p/><p>Similar to the broad group of patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), most patients with an ACS after CABG should be referred for diagnostic coronary arteriography with a view toward early revascularization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-angiography-and-revascularization-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-acute-myocardial-infarction#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary angiography and revascularization for unstable angina or non-ST elevation acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Recurrent ischemia'</a>.) Patients with an unstable presentation after CABG are at increased risk for significant coronary events, including death or myocardial infarction, compared to those without prior CABG. In an analysis of the PURSUIT trial (glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitor versus placebo), patients with prior CABG had significantly higher 30-day mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

For these patients with significant LAD stenosis, we prefer CABG with a LITA graft to the LAD to PCI. If repeat CABG cannot be performed, for example, due to a high risk of reoperation, PCI of the LAD is a reasonable option.</p><p>There is no high quality evidence that can be used to support a choice of CABG or PCI in patients for whom either procedure is reasonable and technically feasible. Early comparative studies are not particularly helpful, as balloon angioplasty was performed without stenting in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. </p><p>More studies suggest comparable long-term mortality between PCI and CABG, but the potential for bias in the choice of procedure limits our ability to draw strong conclusions from these studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of 2191 patients with prior CABG who underwent multivessel revascularization between 1995 and 2000 evaluated outcomes in the 1487 who had repeat CABG and the 704 who underwent PCI (77 percent with at least one stent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The most important factors involved in the choice of repeat CABG were more diseased or occluded grafts, absence of a prior myocardial infarction (MI), lower left ventricular ejection fraction, longer interval from first CABG (15 versus 6 years), more total occlusions in native coronary arteries, and the absence of a patent thoracic artery graft. There was no difference in 30-day mortality with CABG compared to PCI (2.8 versus 1.7 percent, respectively). At five years, unadjusted cumulative survival was similar with CABG and PCI (79.5 versus 75.3 percent). After adjustment, PCI was associated with a nonsignificant increase in mortality risk (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% CI 0.94-2.28). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The AWESOME trial randomly assigned 454 patients with angina refractory to medical therapy and one of five high risk features including prior CABG to either CABG or PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Among the 142 patients with refractory post-CABG ischemia (a high risk feature), there was no significant difference in the three-year survival rates (73 and 76 percent, respectively). Interpretation of these results is limited by the small number of patients and the fact that stents were used in only 54 percent of PCIs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Repeat CABG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients for whom repeat CABG is being considered need to be informed of the higher perioperative mortality and morbidity with a second procedure. Multiple observational studies have shown an approximate three- to fourfold increase in the risk of death with repeat CABG, with rates of 4.8 and 1.8 found in a 2009 report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/8,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21-23</a>]. For patients who undergo repeat CABG, the principles guiding the choice of arterial or venous graft are similar to initial CABG. If the LAD territory is being revascularized, placement of an arterial conduit is preferred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure#H41023269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Causes and rates of graft failure&quot;, section on 'Summary'</a>.)</p><p>Given the increased early mortality with repeat CABG, it has been proposed that there may be an advantage to minimally invasive CABG in this setting, particularly in patients with a patent left internal thoracic artery graft in whom the occluded vessels are inaccessible to PCI. Data are limited on this issue.

PCI of the bypassed native artery has been preferred to PCI of a bypass graft (when technically feasible) because of the higher risk of distal embolization during bypass graft PCI than during native-vessel PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, the use of embolic protection devices has significantly lowered the risk of bypass graft intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].

Some of these are thought to represent a technical complication of the operation, such as a reaction to suturing. These lesions can be treated by PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/28,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30-32</a>]. The efficacy of this approach was illustrated in a review of 174 patients with 202 lesions: Anastomotic (distal) lesions were mostly treated with balloon angioplasty, while ostial lesions were more frequently treated with stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-recurrent-angina-pectoris-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The procedural success was 97 percent, there were no cases of MI, in-hospital mortality was 0.6 percent, and the rate of urgent CABG was 0.6 percent. At one year, mortality was 4.4 percent, MI occurred in 2.9 percent, and target vessel revascularization was performed in 7.4 percent.

It may be caused by both graft disease and by progression of atherosclerosis in non-bypassed vessels. Late recurrence can be manifested as either stable or an acute coronary syndrome. These patients often have symptoms similar to those present before CABG. (See <a href=\"#H532659732\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>We make the following recommendations for management of patients with recurrent angina after CABG (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For stable patients in whom there is a suspicion of late recurrent angina, we recommend diagnostic testing using stress testing with imaging. Such testing allows confirmation of the diagnosis and provides prognostic information that may be useful for management. Patients for whom this testing is not diagnostic may need to proceed to coronary angiography. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent angina with an unstable presentation is associated with significantly worse outcome compared with patients without prior CABG. For these patients, diagnostic testing with urgent coronary angiography is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H2201616\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients should have optimal management of their cardiovascular disease, including the use of antiplatelet therapy, statin, routine exercise (and referral to cardiac rehabilitation programs in some patients), glycemic and blood pressure control, and smoking cessation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an acute coronary syndrome, we recommend urgent revascularization of the culprit lesion or lesions as opposed to a conservative approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H703120015\" class=\"local\">'Indications for revascularization'</a> above.) <br/><br/>In patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), we recommend percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), if technically feasible, instead of CABG (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If PCI is performed, we prefer to revascularize only the culprit lesion at the time of the initial procedure. (See <a href=\"#H370156746\" class=\"local\">'Unstable patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a stable presentation, the management strategy will depend on the findings of diagnostic testing (see <a href=\"#H703120015\" class=\"local\">'Indications for revascularization'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with obstruction of blood flow to the proximal left anterior descending artery and demonstrable extensive anterior ischemia or significant disease in other vessels, we recommend revascularization rather than medical therapy to improve survival (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with obstructive disease but without extensive anterior ischemia, we suggest medical therapy rather than initial revascularization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
