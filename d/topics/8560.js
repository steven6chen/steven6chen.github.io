The location of the displaced urethral meatus may range anywhere within the glans, the shaft of penis, the scrotum, or perineum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58046\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58046 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The management and outcome of hypospadias will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and evaluation of hypospadias are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypospadias-pathogenesis-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypospadias: Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176543921\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical correction for hypospadias is an elective procedure. The clinician's role is to provide information regarding the balance of potential benefits and complications to the family. For infants with mild defects (forme fruste or incomplete or partial presence of hypospadias) with a normally functional penis in respect to voiding and future sexual function, surgical correction is not warranted. However, correction may be entertained for cosmetic reasons based on family preference, as some families may want to correct any asymmetric foreskin defect for religious (circumcision) or social reasons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2789612752\"><span class=\"h2\">Urologic referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for urologic referral is based on the severity of the hypospadias and family preference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113912 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Urologic referral and correction are reserved for those patients in whom there is a potential functional issue including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant deflection of the urinary stream</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to urinate from a standing position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erectile dysfunction due to penile curvature leading to intercourse difficulties</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fertility issues due to sperm deposition difficulties</p><p/><p>Urologic referral is <strong>not</strong> needed for patients with mild defects and if surgical reconstructions is not requested by the family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This includes patients with forme fruste of hypospadias (incomplete or partial presence of hypospadias) and patients with standard distal hypospadias (eg, urethral opening at the proximal glans, coronal margin, or just below the coronal margin) and without penile curvature. This conservative approach was supported by a report of 56 adult men with uncorrected hypospadias including 44 with a mild form who were satisfied with the appearance of their penis, voided in a standing position, and were not infertile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3557801893\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance of circumcision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal circumcision should be avoided in patients with hypospadias where the foreskin is asymmetric with abnormal development on the ventral aspect of the penis. This anatomical configuration is not conducive to a safe neonatal circumcision using a Plastibell or Gomco device due to the inability to properly place either device over the glans and have sufficient foreskin to complete the circumcision. In addition, for standard and severe forms of hypospadias, the foreskin needs to be preserved and reserved for use during the hypospadias reconstruction to prevent fistula formation, and in severe cases, to reconstruct the new urethra. As a result, circumcision, should it be desired by the family, is delayed until a freehand circumcision can be safely performed in the operating room.</p><p>However, if unanticipated hypospadias (megameatus intact prepuce) is found at the time of neonatal circumcision due to an intact normal foreskin, it appears that the circumcision does not affect future successful reconstruction and can be completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypospadias-pathogenesis-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H4021400979\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypospadias: Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Other uncommon variants'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H817236658\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H963777620\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, surgery is indicated for patients with hypospadias who are at-risk for voiding or sexual dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113912 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2789612752\" class=\"local\">'Urologic referral'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3593572115\"><span class=\"h2\">Goal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of surgical correction is to create a penis with normal function and appearance with a urethral opening as close as possible to the ventral tip of the penis. Surgical correction should result in a properly directed urinary stream and a straightened penis upon erection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In most cases, the corrected penis will be similar in appearance to a circumcised normal penis; however, the foreskin may be preserved in cases of standard hypospadias with a distal urethral opening and without curvature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H407733292\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General consensus within the pediatric urology community, including our own practice, is to perform surgery between six months and one year of age in full-term, healthy infants. This timing, which is consistent with recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), allows ample time for completion of a two-stage procedure in patients with severe hypospadias prior to the beginning of gender identification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In general, six months is the minimum time needed between procedures to ensure complete wound healing following the initial surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2198347119\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous techniques to repair hypospadias are available and used based upon the severity of the defect. All of the interventions are performed under general anesthesia and, in most cases, as a same-day (ambulatory) procedure without an overnight admission to the hospital. The time of surgery varies from one to three hours and depends upon the severity of the hypospadias deformity.</p><p>The operations used to correct hypospadias include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary tubularization &ndash; Tubularized urethroplasty, with or without incision of the urethral plate (tubularized incised plate [TIP]), is commonly used for glandular and penile shaft hypospadias repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This procedure consists of making a new urethra by rolling a ventral strip of penile shaft skin that would have formed the urethra if development had not been arrested (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69788\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69788 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onlay island flap &ndash; For more severe hypospadias, an onlay island flap is used in which the urethra is created by transferring a vascular strip of inner foreskin onto the ventral skin (urethral plate) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82255\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82255 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The skin is sewn to the urethral plate in an onlay fashion, hence the name of the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-stage hypospadias repair &ndash; For the most extreme or severe forms of hypospadias, including cases with significant penile curvature, a two-stage approach is used to straighten the penis and create a new urethral opening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In the first operation, which should be performed at six months of age, the curved penis is corrected by the insertion of dorsal midline plication sutures in the nerve-free zone at the 12 o'clock position, which straightens the penis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76582%7EPEDS%2F55604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76582 graphicRef55604 \">figure 3A-B</a>). This technique allows preservation of sexual function as it does not affect penile innervation. In addition, excess dorsal foreskin is transferred to the ventral side of the penis, as this tissue is required for the second stage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypospadias-pathogenesis-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypospadias: Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The second operation is performed at least six months later, after healing is complete from the first procedure. In this stage, the urethra is reconstructed using the transferred dorsal skin that is now on the ventral aspect of the penis in a manner similar to the primary tubularization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penile curvature (chordee) &ndash; Correction of penile curvature is a critical step in successful hypospadias surgery. Based on anatomical studies of the human fetal penis, a simpler approach is advocated that entails placement of dorsal midline plication sutures in the nerve-free zone at 12 o'clock (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64744\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64744 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. This allows for preservation of sexual function without manipulation of the penile innervation.</p><p/><p>In any of the procedures, the addition of a complete covering layer over the newly constructed urethra is recommended, as this reduces the risk of developing a urethral fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2206438936\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2578541457\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of surgical procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For standard hypospadias, the procedure of choice is primary tubularization, and when necessary, incision of the urethral plate.</p><p>There is no consensus on what is the best surgical approach in correcting severe hypospadias, and the choice is primarily based on the clinician's personal experience and preference. Major impediments in establishing best surgical clinical practice include the lack of a clear-cut definition of severe hypospadias and penile curvature, defined outcome measures, and the effect of potential concomitant conditions (eg, disorders of sex development [DSD]) on outcome. In addition, rates of secondary surgery remain high regardless of the surgical technique used, especially for patients with more severe hypospadias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Further studies are needed to establish consistency within the pediatric urology community for accurate diagnosis and definition of severe hypospadias, identification of potential confounding factors, measurable and clinically significant outcome measures, and appropriate timing of follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3369705988\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents should also understand the potential of anesthetic risks. Animal evidence and retrospective human studies have raised concern that general anesthesia may impair brain development in infants and young children. However, there is growing evidence that a short, single exposure to anesthesia in otherwise healthy children is unlikely to cause cognitive or behavioral abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurotoxic effects of anesthetics on the developing brain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3459354171\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed previously, these procedures are usually performed in an ambulatory setting, and patients are discharged on the same day of surgery. In our practice, we suggest that families who have traveled a long distance spend the night in a local hotel, so that, if questions or problems arise, they can be addressed in an expeditious manner, thereby minimizing parental anxiety.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H591366414\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative care performed by the family involves the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bladder catheter care</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with mild forms of hypospadias, a catheter may not be used or may be left in for 24 to 48 hours and fall out when the dressing comes off at home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with more complicated hypospadias repairs, a catheter (stent or urinary diversion tube) will be left in the bladder to drain urine for 5 to 10 days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76945 \">figure 5</a>). In most patients who are not yet toilet trained, double-diaper technique is used with the catheter extending through the inner diaper and draining directly into the outer diaper (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113910\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113910 \">picture 2</a>). In older children, the catheter is connected to a leg bag. The catheter is removed during a follow-up appointment 5 to 10 days after surgery. For patients who live far away, the catheter can be removed by an urologist or pediatrician in the community, and in some cases, a family member can be taught how to remove the catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bladder spasms</strong> &ndash; Bladder spasms can occur in patients with a catheter. During an episode of spasm, the child typically will arch his back and bring his knees up to his chest, and squirts of urine may be noted through or around the tube. Although spasms are not harmful, they are uncomfortable. In these patients, anticholinergic medications can be used to relieve bladder spasms until the night before the tube is removed. Typically, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxybutynin</a> at a dose of 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> given three times per day. Side effects of anticholinergics include a dry mouth and flushing of the face.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prophylactic antibiotic</strong> &ndash; A prophylactic antibiotic is generally given until a few days after catheter removal. We typically use the same antibiotic regimen used for prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Single daily prophylactic doses of commonly used antimicrobial agents include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX or TMP alone) &minus; Dosing is based on TMP at 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Nitrofurantoin</a> &minus; 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Amoxicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a>, and cephalosporins are not generally recommended because of the increased likelihood of resistant organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, these agents are used in infants below two months of age, because sulfonamides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">trimethoprim</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitrofurantoin</a> are associated with serious adverse effects (eg, hyperbilirubinemia) in this age group and should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The following are single daily prophylactic doses for these agents:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Cephalexin</a> &minus; 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Ampicillin</a> &minus; 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Amoxicillin</a> &minus; 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pain control</strong> &ndash; During the surgical procedure, most children will have a caudal or penile nerve block in addition to general anesthesia. The analgesic effects of the nerve block will disappear in approximately six to eight hours after the procedure, at which time children will begin to experience discomfort <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To prevent pain and discomfort, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> or a combination of acetaminophen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">codeine</a> is administered approximately three to four hours after surgery, even if the child appears comfortable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Acetaminophen</a> &ndash; 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose given every six hours as needed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Acetaminophen</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a> &ndash; Dosing is based on hydrocodone 0.1 to 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose given every six hours as needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The surgical pain typically lasts 48 to 72 hours. Once the catheter is removed or if the catheter is not used, patients may have pain on voiding for one or two days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dressings</strong> &ndash; Patients usually go home with the original dressing consisting of a clear plastic cover over gauze pads that are taped over the penis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113911\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113911 \">picture 3</a>). The dressing is typically removed two to three days after surgery, which can be done by soaking the child in the bath. The dressing may become soiled from old blood from the procedure, urine, and, rarely, from a bowel movement. If this occurs in the first few days after surgery, the dressing is typically left in place, and we recommend cleaning with soapy warm water (wiping away from the child's penis towards the rectum). Once the dressing is removed, the penis may appear swollen, discolored, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bruised. There may also be a bloody discharge from the penis, which may result in blood spots on the dressing, diaper, or underpants. These findings are normal and will resolve with time. Twice-a-day bathing will help resolve the swelling and facilitate dissolving of the absorbable sutures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diapers</strong> &ndash; In infants that require a catheter after the repair, we use the double-diaper technique (ie, use of two diapers) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113910\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113910 \">picture 2</a>). The parents should be instructed on how to arrange the double diapers, with the inner diaper used to capture stool and the outer diaper for urine drainage from the catheter. The inner diaper has a small hole cut in it where the catheter can exit, and then urine drains into the outer diaper.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Powder or any other ointment should not be applied to the genital area. Once the dressing soaks off, lubricant (eg, KY jelly) can be applied to the outer diaper where the penis will touch the diaper to prevent the child's penis from sticking to the diaper.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diet</strong> &ndash; A normal diet can be resumed, and fluid intake should be encouraged. Some children may experience nausea or vomiting from general anesthesia, which resolves within one or two days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Activity</strong> &ndash; In toddlers and older children, strenuous physical activity and straddling toys (eg, bicycle riding) should be avoided for four weeks.</p><p/><p>The following findings require medical evaluation in the perioperative period through three weeks following surgery:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral temperature greater than 101&deg;F (38.3&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive bleeding (more than spotting or blood stains on the dressing)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme <span class=\"nowrap\">irritability/inconsolability</span> or pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing redness of the penis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change in urination pattern or urinary stream (eg, two urinary streams or thin stream)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty in urination</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H911122771\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following surgical reconstruction, the urinary stream should be observed. Initially, there may be some spraying of urine, which is normal. This should resolve over a few months as the swelling from the operation resolves. However, two urinary streams are suggestive of a urinary fistula, and a thin urinary stream is suggestive of a urethral stricture. If this occurs, the pediatric urology team should be notified. (See <a href=\"#H2206438936\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>After the catheter is removed, or in patients who did not require a catheter, follow-up appointments are scheduled six weeks after surgery, one year from surgery, after toilet training, and as an adolescent. At each visit, patients are assessed for signs and symptoms for urinary tract infection, fistula, diverticulum, urethral stricture, and cosmetic outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2206438936\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following complications may occur after hypospadias repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urethral fistula &ndash; The most common complication following hypospadias surgery is urethrocutaneous fistula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50774\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50774 \">picture 4</a>), which is characterized as two urinary streams because of the extra urethral opening. This complication is reported in approximately 4 to 20 percent of patients, depending on the severity of their hypospadias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Fistula correction requires a second operation that is performed six months after the initial procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urethral stricture &ndash; Urethral stricture is due to tightening of the reconstructed urethra within the glans, which is referred to as meatal stenosis. These children will have symptoms of straining or pushing on urination and a thin or fine urinary stream. Correction of a urethral stricture requires a second operation at least six months following the prior surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urethral diverticulum &ndash; Urethral diverticulum is due to outpouching of the reconstructed urethra. These children can have ballooning of the ventral aspect of the penis on urination and dribbling from retained urine after they void. Correction of a urethral stricture requires a second operation, ideally, at least six months following the prior surgery, unless recurrent infection requires more immediate intervention.</p><p/><p>In a population-based Australian study of 3186 males with hypospadias, the overall complication rate of fistula and strictures was 13 percent for the 1718 primary repairs performed between 2001 and 2010, with the highest rate of 33 percent in cases of proximal hypospadias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. One-half of the complications occurred after one year postrepair. In this cohort, patients with ectopic urethral meatus that were proximally located were at increased risk of reoperation, but there was no effect of the age at primary repair on the risk of reoperation.</p><p>An analysis using the database of the Faculty Practice Solutions Center for primary hypospadias repair in 2009 and 2010 performed at 47 centers showed that patients with distal hypospadias (ectopic urethra located at the proximal glans, coronal margin, or just below the coronal margin) had a 9 percent secondary surgery rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. After adjusting for confounding factors, a lower number of distal repairs performed per year for a given surgeon was associated with increasing risk for fistula, stricture, or diverticulum repair. Increasing patient age at the time of distal repair was also associated with an increased likelihood of secondary cystoscopy and procedures requiring urethral dilation or incision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3421500566\"><span class=\"h1\">HORMONAL THERAPY NOT BENEFICIAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, preoperative routine use of testosterone therapy has not been beneficial in patients with hypospadias to improve surgical outcome. Although published data are limited and of poor quality, the evidence also suggests that preoperative testosterone therapy is not beneficial and may increase complications. This was illustrated by a systematic review of the literature of retrospective observational studies, which reported that for patients with severe penoscrotal defects, there was a trend of increased complications with preoperative intramuscular testosterone compared with no hormonal therapy (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95% CI 0.96-2.91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In cases of microphallus, defined as penile length below the third percentile for age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66323 \">figure 6</a>), testosterone therapy may stimulate penile growth and is administered prior to hypospadias correction in collaboration with our pediatric endocrinology team. The recommended starting dose is 25 to 50 mg of testosterone propionate given intramuscularly once per week for three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>].

Clinical experience has also shown that surgical curvature correction is important to assure satisfactory sexual performance. Follow-up of infants who underwent hypospadias repair demonstrates that the reconstructed urethra grows appropriately, and subsequent surgery is seldom necessary.</p><p>In one follow-up study, boys who underwent hypospadias repair had similar self-perception to normal healthy controls regarding the appearance of their penis, gender role behavior, first sexual experiences, and sexual attitudes when surveyed between 7 and 17 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypospadias-management-and-outcome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>As a result, parents can be counseled that surgical correction generally results in an excellent outcome with a good cosmetic and functional repair, satisfactory genital self-perception, sexual performance, and fertility in the majority of patients with hypospadias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

The location of the displaced urethral meatus may range anywhere within the glans, the shaft of penis, the scrotum, or perineum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58046\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58046 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical correction is an elective procedure. Urologic referral and reconstruction is indicated for patients with hypospadias who are at-risk for voiding and sexual dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113912 \">table 1</a>). Urologic referral and potentially surgical correction is indicated for patients who are at-risk for the following (see <a href=\"#H2789612752\" class=\"local\">'Urologic referral'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Significant deflection of the urinary stream</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inability to urinate from a standing position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Erectile dysfunction due to penile curvature leading to intercourse difficulties</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fertility issues due to sperm deposition difficulties</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest no surgical correction for patients with forme fruste (incomplete or partial presence of hypospadias) that do not affect voiding or sexual function (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Examples would be a distally located ectopic urethral opening and a penis without significant curvature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69380\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69380 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107623\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107623 \">picture 6</a>). However, surgery is an option for some families who want to pursue reconstruction to improve cosmetic appearance for religious (circumcision) or social reasons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with asymmetric foreskin due to abnormal development on the ventral aspect of the penis, we recommend not to perform circumcision in the newborn period (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). In these male neonates, the use of a routine circumcision devices (Plastibell or Gomco device) is not safe and is associated with increased risk of complication. Circumcision, should it be desired by the family, is delayed until a freehand circumcision can be safely performed in the operating room later in life. (See <a href=\"#H3557801893\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of circumcision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of surgical correction is to create a penis with normal function and appearance with a urethral opening as close as possible to the ventral tip of the penis. Surgical correction should result in a properly directed urinary stream and a straightened penis upon erection. Hypospadias correction is performed between six months and one year of age in full-term, healthy infants. This timing allows for completion of a two-stage hypospadias repair (if necessary) by 18 months of age before the beginning of gender identification. (See <a href=\"#H817236658\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numerous techniques to repair hypospadias are available and used based upon the severity of the defect.

(See <a href=\"#H3421500566\" class=\"local\">'Hormonal therapy not beneficial'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because most of the cases are performed as ambulatory procedures, it is important to review postoperative care with the parents. This includes instructions on dressing care, pain control, double diapering, diet, activity, prophylactic antibiotics, findings that require clinical evaluation (eg, fever, excessive bleeding, urination difficulties, and intractable pain), and bladder catheter care. (See <a href=\"#H3459354171\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical complications include urethral fistula, stricture, and diverticulum.
