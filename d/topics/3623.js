AML has also been called acute myelogenous leukemia and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia.</p><p>AML is characterized by a clonal proliferation of myeloid precursors with a reduced capacity to differentiate into more mature cellular elements. As a result, there is an accumulation of leukemic blasts or immature forms in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and occasionally in other tissues, with a variable reduction in the production of normal red blood cells, platelets, and mature granulocytes. The increased production of malignant cells, along with a reduction in these mature elements, results in a variety of systemic consequences including anemia, bleeding, and an increased risk of infection.

This leukemia usually has myeloid markers, but can also co-express lymphoid markers such as CD19, PAX5, and cytoplasmic CD79. This should not be construed as evidence for a mixed phenotype. CD56 is expressed in a fraction of cases. Occasionally, the malignant cells in some of these patients appear cytogenetically normal or contain only a detectable -Y or del(9q) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods will demonstrate the cryptic <em>RUNX1-RUNX1T1</em> rearrangement.</p><p>The leukemia is associated with a more favorable prognosis. The presence of <em>c-KIT</em> mutations is an adverse prognostic feature in patients with t(8;21).

In typical cases, the bone marrow demonstrates abnormalities of the eosinophils in addition to the typical morphologic features of AML.

Although listed in the WHO classification, myeloid sarcoma is not a subtype of AML, but rather a unique clinical presentation of any subtype of AML. Myeloid sarcoma may present simultaneously with or precede bone marrow disease, and may be seen in relapse or as progression of a prior myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasm. Importantly, the management of patients with myeloid sarcoma without evidence of AML on bone marrow biopsy is similar to that for patients with overt AML. The pretreatment evaluation should include pathologic and genetic analyses to allow for classification into one of the other WHO subtypes.
