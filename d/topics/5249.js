This translates to a height that is below the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile.</p><p>The most common causes of short stature beyond the first year or two of life are familial (genetic) short stature and constitutional short stature (also known as constitutional delay of growth and puberty), which are normal nonpathologic variants of growth. These growth patterns often can be distinguished from one another, but some children have features of both (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature#H297546528\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;, section on 'Normal variants of growth'</a>). The goal of the evaluation of a child with short stature is to identify the subset of children with pathologic causes, such as Turner syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease or other underlying systemic disease, or hormonal abnormality. The evaluation also assesses the severity of the short stature and likely growth trajectory, to facilitate decisions about intervention, if appropriate. Some components of the evaluation can reasonably be performed in the primary care setting, including initial interpretation of the growth chart and growth potential (based on measured heights of the child's parents), calculation of height velocity (HV), initial laboratory screening for an underlying systemic or endocrine disease, if suspected based on symptoms. If HV is slow, then bone age determination should be performed if expert interpretation is available. Other components of the evaluation, including review of the bone age results and the detailed evaluation for causes of short stature, are typically performed by a pediatric endocrinologist, if available. </p><p>Referral patterns reveal substantial sex differences in the evaluation and treatment of short stature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Boys are referred for evaluation more often, at younger ages and for less severe height deficits as compared with girls. As an example, in one retrospective review of 288 children referred to a single center for assessment of short stature, the male:female ratio was 1.9:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At the time of referral, the height deficit was significantly greater for girls than boys (median height Z-score, -2.4 versus -1.9), and organic disease was more common among girls (40 versus 15 percent). Similarly, studies of growth hormone registries have shown preferential treatment of boys compared with girls with an approximate ratio of 2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>This apparent gender bias may be due to under-appreciation of growth problems in girls, leading to fewer evaluations of girls for short stature. Alternatively, it may be due to increased societal pressure for tall stature in boys, leading to increased referral and growth hormone treatment of boys without organic causes of short stature. These findings emphasize the need for accurate growth monitoring during the health care maintenance of all children to ensure appropriate referral and treatment.</p><p>This topic will review the diagnostic approach to children with short stature, beginning with a brief review of normal growth and development. The causes of short stature are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL GROWTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial measurements of growth are an important parameter in monitoring the health of children. In general, a normal pattern of growth suggests good health, while growth that is slower than normal raises the possibility of an underlying subacute or chronic illness, including an endocrinologic cause of growth failure. </p><p>Statural growth is a continuous but not linear process. There are three phases of postnatal growth (infantile, childhood, and pubertal), each of which has a distinctive pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The phases are similar for boys and girls, but the timing and pace of growth differ, particularly during puberty. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrauterine &ndash; Size at birth is determined more by maternal nutrition and intrauterine and placental factors than by genetic makeup. Not all the genes that affect growth may be expressed at birth. As a result, the correlation coefficient between birth length and adult height is only 0.25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infancy &ndash; During the first two years of life (infantile phase), linear growth initially is very rapid and gradually decelerates. Overall growth during this period is about 30 to 35 cm. The length (and weight) of premature infants must be corrected for gestational age, at least for the first year. However, growth is often accelerated during the second half of the first year in otherwise healthy children born early. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An infant's height curve often crosses percentile lines during the first 24 months of life as the growth moves away from the influences of the intrauterine environment and toward the child's genetic potential. As examples, infants born small because of placental or uterine constraint may move upwards across percentile curves (&quot;channeling up&quot;), whereas infants born large because of maternal-fetal overnutrition may cross downward across percentile curves (&quot;channeling down&quot;). After this adjustment period, the correlation between length at two years and adult height is 0.80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Childhood &ndash; The childhood phase is characterized by linear growth at a relatively constant velocity, with some slowing in later childhood. Most children grow at the following rates (representing the 10<sup>th</sup> to 90<sup>th</sup> percentiles):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age two to four years: 5.5 to 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> (2.2 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age four to six years: 5 to 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> (2 to 3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age six years to puberty: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> for boys (1.6 to 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>4.5 to 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> for girls (1.8 to 2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescence &ndash; The pubertal phase is characterized by a growth spurt of 8 to 14 cm per year due to the synergistic effects of increasing gonadal steroids and growth hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In girls, the pubertal growth spurt typically starts around age 10, but may start as early as age 8 for early maturing girls. In boys, the pubertal growth spurt typically starts around age 12, but may start as early as age 10 in early maturing boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p>The &quot;rule of fives&quot; incorporates these typical phases of growth and provides an estimate for normal height and height velocity in a given age group, as shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70382\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70382 \">figure 1</a>). Actual height and growth rate in a healthy child can vary substantially around these approximations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523440\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF GROWTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of a child suspected of having short stature is guided by answering the following questions. Although the causes and clinical presentation of short stature vary by age group, the same questions are relevant for children of any age:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How short is the child?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the child's height velocity (HV) impaired?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the child's likely adult height?</p><p/><p>The answers to these questions guide a focused history and physical examination, and in some cases laboratory evaluation, to determine the cause and appropriate management of the child with short stature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94743\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94743 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Is the child short?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate measurement of length or height is essential; inaccurate measurements or aberrant plotting is one of the more common causes of apparent growth failure. Length is measured lying down and should be used for infants and children up to 24 months of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67950%7EPEDS%2F80511\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67950 graphicRef80511 \">figure 2A-B</a>); height is measured standing and should be used for children two years and older (if possible) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56127\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56127 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63399%7EPEDS%2F77249\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63399 graphicRef77249 \">figure 4A-B</a>). The results should be plotted on the growth chart that is appropriate for the child's age and gender. Weight should also be measured to provide additional information about the child's nutritional status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Percentiles and Z-scores can be calculated using a calculator for recumbent length (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-who-infant-length-for-age-percentiles-less-than24-months\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), or standing height for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cdc-height-for-age-percentiles-for-boys-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) or for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cdc-height-for-age-percentiles-for-girls-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>). For the purposes of an endocrine evaluation, short stature is defined as a length or height more than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean (ie, a Z-score &lt;-2), which corresponds to a height that is &lt;2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Height above the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile (&gt;-2 SD) &ndash; These children generally do not require further specific evaluation unless there are additional reasons for concern, such as progressively decreasing height percentiles (implying growth failure), dysmorphic features, evidence of underlying systemic disease, or if they are growing well below their genetic potential (eg, they are children of very tall parents).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Height below the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile (&le;-2 SD) &ndash; These children have short stature and should undergo a more detailed evaluation, starting with evaluation of growth rate, as outlined in the following sections. The first steps of this evaluation usually can be performed in the primary care setting. Early referral to a specialist is appropriate, if the growth rate is very slow. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Height less than the 1<sup>st</sup> percentile (&le;-2.25 SD) &ndash; These children have extreme short stature and usually should be referred to an appropriate subspecialist for a detailed evaluation, where available. The first steps in the evaluation will be similar, but a higher index of suspicion for pathologic causes of growth failure is appropriate. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Is the child's height velocity impaired?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determination of the child's growth rate, or HV, is an essential component of the evaluation for short stature and can be considered a &quot;vital sign&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94743\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94743 \">algorithm 1</a>). This requires serial measurements of height, which should be measured along with weight at each well-child visit. Serial measurements help to determine whether the child's HV is within normal range and whether it progressively deviates from its previous growth channel (or percentile curve). The HV should be calculated (in <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year)</span> using accurate measurements of height and an interval between measurements of at least six months. </p><p>For children two years and older, <strong>growth failure is likely</strong> if: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The height-for-age curve has deviated downwards across two major height percentile curves (eg, from above the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile to below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Or, if the child is growing slower than the following rates: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age two to four years: HV less than 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> (&lt;2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age four to six years: HV less than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> (&lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age six years to puberty: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>HV less than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> for boys (&lt;1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>HV less than 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> for girls (&lt;1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p/><p>Short children with HV <strong>above</strong> these cut points usually have a nonpathologic cause of short stature, such as familial short stature or constitutional delay of growth. For these children, a basic evaluation for short stature usually is sufficient, consisting of a focused history, physical examination, adult height prediction, and bone age determination, as outlined in the following sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H64002967\" class=\"local\">'Prediction of adult height'</a> below and <a href=\"#H282452950\" class=\"local\">'Bone age determination'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>Short children with HV <strong>below</strong> these cut points are more likely to have a pathologic cause of short stature and warrant additional attention. In addition to the basic evaluation outlined above, laboratory screening for pathologic causes of growth failure is warranted. The clinician should be particularly alert for subtle symptoms of underlying systemic disease (eg, Crohn disease) and for evidence of Turner syndrome in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The detailed evaluation may be most appropriately performed by a pediatric endocrinologist, if available. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory and imaging studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Short children with HV <strong>substantially below</strong> these cut points are most likely to have a pathologic cause of short stature and should undergo a detailed evaluation for pathologic causes of growth failure by a pediatric subspecialist, if available. </p><p>Alternatively, for a more precise assessment, the child's HV can be plotted on an HV chart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96367%7EPEDS%2F96366\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96367 graphicRef96366 \">figure 5A-B</a>) to determine the HV percentile (or SD [Z-score]) for the child's age and gender (note that this is different from the height-for-age percentile). In general, HV between the 10<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> percentile should raise concern for possible growth failure, and an HV below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile warrants a thorough evaluation for growth failure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64002967\"><span class=\"h2\">Prediction of adult height</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adult height is determined by a combination of genetic potential and many other factors that influence somatic growth and biologic maturation. No method accurately predicts adult height, and there is wide variation in predicted adult height among the different methods. However, an estimate of adult height can be developed using information about heights in the biologic family, combined with information about the child's own growth and level of skeletal development. The results help to guide decisions about evaluation and treatment, and also provide some information about the possible causes of short stature in a particular patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114183513\"><span class=\"h3\">Is the child&rsquo;s growth within the range for the family?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The next step is to determine the height range expected for the child's biologic family and compare it with the child's growth trajectory. In most populations, a predicted adult height that is &lt;63 inches (160 cm) for men and &lt;59 inches (150 cm) for women is considered short stature, corresponding to more than 2 SD below the mean (&lt;2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile) for adults of the same population and gender. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Midparental height</strong> &ndash; An estimate of a child's genetic height potential can be obtained by calculation of the midparental height, which is based upon the heights of both parents and adjusted for the sex of the child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94743\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94743 \">algorithm 1</a>). This estimate is also known as the &quot;target height&quot;. Whenever possible, the parents' heights should be directly measured rather than self-reported. The calculation can be performed using a calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-prediction-of-childs-target-height-based-on-midparental-height\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 4</a>) or the following equation:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For girls, 13 cm (or 5 inches) is subtracted from the father's height and averaged with the mother's height.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For boys, 13 cm (or 5 inches) is added to the mother's height and averaged with the father's height.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For both girls and boys, 8.5 cm (3.3 inches) on either side of this calculated value (target height) represents the 3rd to 97th percentiles for anticipated adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In this calculation, the 13 cm (or 5 inches) represent the average difference in the average height of adult men and women. Thus, the child grows, on average, to the midparental height percentile. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Projected height</strong> &ndash; The projected height for a child older than two years is determined by extrapolating the child's growth along the current channel to the 18- to 20-year mark (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64811 \">figure 6</a>). If the child's bone age is delayed or advanced, then the projected height should be plotted based on the bone age rather than the chronologic age. (See <a href=\"#H282452950\" class=\"local\">'Bone age determination'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The child's projected height is then compared with the range calculated from the midparental (target) height.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child's projected height is within 8.5 cm (2 SD) of the midparental height, then the child's height is within the expected range for the family. This child probably has familial short stature, which is considered a variant of normal growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature#H297546569\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;, section on 'Familial short stature'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the projected height is more than 8.5 cm (2 SD) below the midparental height, then the child can be considered abnormally short for his or her family. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31798085\"><span class=\"h3\">Is there evidence of delayed or accelerated growth?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with severe short stature (height &lt;-2.25 SD) or growth failure should undergo a radiographic determination of bone age. This helps to determine whether the child's growth is delayed or accelerated compared with his or her chronological age. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282452950\"><span class=\"h4\">Bone age determination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone age (also known as skeletal age) is typically determined from a radiograph of the left hand and wrist, and requires expert interpretation. The methods used most commonly for determining skeletal age are the Greulich and Pyle Atlas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and the Tanner-Whitehouse (TW3) method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In general, TW3 is considered to be more accurate, based on studies in predominantly white European populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, bone ages obtained from these methods are less generalizable to children of non-white ethnicities; African American children tend to have advanced bone age, and Southeast Asian children tend to have delayed bone age, compared with their white peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>The bone age determination informs estimates of the child's growth potential and likely adult height, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed or advanced bone age is defined as a bone age that is 2 SD or more below or above the mean, respectively. This is approximately 20 percent below or above the chronological age. This translates to a difference between bone age and chronological age of approximately 12 months between 2 and 4 years of chronological age, 18 months between 4 and 12 years, and 24 months after age 12 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94179%7EPEDS%2F94180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94179 graphicRef94180 \">figure 7A-B</a>). If the bone age is delayed or advanced near or beyond these parameters, then the projected height should be recalculated based on the bone age rather than the chronologic age. This will provide a more accurate assessment of projected height. As an example, if an eight-year-old boy is 117 cm tall and has a bone age of 6.5 years, this corresponds to the 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile for chronological age, but to the 35<sup>th</sup> percentile for skeletal age, suggesting that the child may have constitutional delay of growth. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bone age can be used to predict the child's adult height. The technique developed by Bayley-Pinneau (BP) is most commonly used for children approximately six years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This technique employs a table to translate the child's bone age and chronological age to a decimal fraction of adult height (eg, 0.75). To predict adult height, the present height is divided by the fraction of adult height. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other methods use different algorithms to predict adult height from height measurements and bone age data, and include the Tanner-Whitehouse 3 (TW3), Roche-Wainer-Thissen (RWT), and Khamis-Roche (KR) methods. RWT and KR incorporate midparental height in addition to bone age, and TW3 uses a skeletal maturity score. Comparison of these methods reveals a wide range of adult height predictions. Overall, the TW3 method (or the previous version, TW2) either under-predicts or over-predicts adult height in about 30 percent of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], while the BP and RWT methods tend to over-predict adult height in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The BP method is most likely to identify a short child as a candidate for growth hormone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Methods that incorporate bone age are generally more accurate in predicting adult height than the simple midparental height method. However, there is a wide variation in height prediction, and the same method may yield significantly different adult height predictions at different ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p>The results of the bone age determination also provide important information about possible causes of the short stature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94743\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94743 \">algorithm 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significantly delayed bone age is consistent with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), which is considered a variant of normal growth. However, significantly delayed bone age is also seen in many types of pathologic growth failure, including nutritional deficiency, underlying systemic disease (such as inflammatory bowel disease), and growth hormone deficiency. The HV helps to distinguish between these categories: children with CDGP tend to have normal or low-normal HV until they reach bone age of 11 years in girls, or 13 years in boys. By contrast, children with underlying systemic or endocrine disease tend to have progressive decreases in HV. Children with significantly delayed bone age should undergo a focused history and physical examination to evaluate for symptoms and signs of systemic or endocrine disease (see <a href=\"#H64002974\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation for causes of short stature'</a> below). Their growth should also be carefully monitored. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A normal bone age is consistent with several diagnostic possibilities: in a child with short parents, a normal bone age supports the diagnosis of familial short stature. However, a normal bone age is also seen in younger girls with Turner syndrome. Moreover, bone age may be only mildly delayed in early or mild forms of some of the systemic diseases that cause growth failure. Therefore, a bone age that is within normal limits suggests that underlying genetic or systemic disease is unlikely, but not impossible. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced bone age is occasionally seen in older children and adolescents with short stature, especially precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism. These children usually experienced accelerated early growth but are at risk for early epiphysial closure, resulting in short stature as an adult, if not properly diagnosed and treated.

In otherwise healthy children, the yield of testing is extremely low. One study described the clinical evaluation of 235 children who were referred for short stature and had height &lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile, but normal growth rate and no symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this group of low-risk short children, nearly 99 percent were ultimately diagnosed with variants of normal growth (23 percent with familial short stature, 41 percent with constitutional delay of growth, and 36 percent with ISS). The cost per new diagnosis identified was more than $100,000, although most patients did not undergo all of the screening tests that have been recommended in consensus guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Because of the low diagnostic yield and high cost, we suggest performing laboratory testing only selectively in otherwise asymptomatic children, as outlined below. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <strong>basic evaluation</strong> consisting of a bone age determination is appropriate for children with short stature, normal growth rate (eg, height velocity [HV] at least 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> between four and six years of age, and at least 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> between six years and puberty), and no other symptoms. The bone age determination provides a more accurate assessment of adult height and clarifies the type of growth defect, as described above (see <a href=\"#H31798085\" class=\"local\">'Is there evidence of delayed or accelerated growth?'</a> above). Screening for celiac disease is also reasonable for children with gastrointestinal symptoms or first-degree relatives with celiac disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Broader testing</strong> may be warranted if the child is severely short (eg, height &le;-2.5 standard deviations [SD, 0.6<sup>th</sup> percentile]), has growth failure (eg, height-for-age curve crossing two major percentile lines, or HV &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> between four and six years of age, and &lt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> between six years and puberty), or if the history or physical examination raised suspicion for a specific systemic, endocrine, or genetic disorder. Decisions regarding the extent of testing should be made in conjunction with a pediatric subspecialist, but vary with the child's presenting symptoms and the clinical setting. We perform the following battery of tests to screen for several pathologic causes of short stature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94176\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94176 \">table 1</a>), as outlined in a consensus statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electrolytes, creatinine, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, albumin. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Celiac serologies (eg, tissue transglutaminase [tTG] immunoglobulin A [IgA] and total IgA) &ndash; Several guidelines recommend celiac screening for short stature, as well as for other indications.
