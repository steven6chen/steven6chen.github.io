Since this disorder is rare, each clinician is likely to encounter only one or a few cases during his or her career. The combination of lack of familiarity and the myriad of potential symptoms and signs often leads to misinterpretation of the clinical manifestations. Delay in both diagnosis and treatment are the rule.</p><p>Dural sinus thrombosis encompasses three basic syndromes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cavernous sinus thrombosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral sinus thrombosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis</p><p/><p>The manifestations of each syndrome are unique because the anatomy of the specific sites differs. Thus, the clinician must be familiar with the anatomy of the dural sinuses in order to understand the clinical manifestations of each entity. All three syndromes result in severe headaches, and headache is the usual complaint that brings the patient to the clinician. An exception to this rule is the older adult patient (over age 65 years) who more commonly presents with an alteration in mental status without antecedent headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SEPTIC CAVERNOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cavernous sinus is the most frequent dural sinus to become infected and thrombosed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65634 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cavernous sinuses are the most centrally located of the dural sinuses, positioned just lateral to the base of the sella turcica and to the sphenoid air sinuses. These irregularly shaped sinuses contain multiple trabeculae that act as sieves to trap bacteria, and this characteristic explains the higher risk of infection of the cavernous sinuses as compared with the other dural sinuses. The cavernous sinuses are connected by two intercavernous sinuses that pass anteriorly and posteriorly to the sella turcica and the pituitary gland.</p><p>A number of cranial nerves are located in fibrous sheaths along the lateral wall of each cavernous sinus: the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III), the trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV), and the ophthalmic (V<sub>1</sub>) and maxillary branches (V<sub>2</sub>) of the trigeminal nerve. The abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) is located more medially, near the internal carotid artery that also tracks through the cavernous sinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The cavernous sinuses receive blood from the facial veins and pterygoid plexus via the inferior and superior ophthalmic veins. Infections of the face including the nose, orbits, tonsils, and soft palate can spread to the cavernous sinus by this route.</p><p>Three sites of primary infection are the most likely to lead to septic cavernous sinus thrombosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial infections involving what has been termed the danger zone (medial third of the face [ie, the areas around the eyes and nose]) that drains into the ophthalmic veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55404\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55404 \">figure 2</a>). Nasal furuncles are the most common facial infection to produce this complication, particularly if the furuncle is squeezed or drained in the absence of antibiotic coverage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sphenoid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ethmoid sinus infections have increasingly been reported with cavernous sinus thrombosis. Infection can arise via the emissary veins or, in the case of sphenoid sinusitis, can spread by breaking through the lateral air sinus wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute sinusitis and rhinosinusitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ethmoid sinus infection can extend laterally to the orbit and subsequently spread to the cavernous sinus via the superior ophthalmic vein. Sphenoid sinus infection is particularly difficult to diagnose, and treatment is often delayed, providing time for the infection to spread to the cavernous sinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dental infection less commonly can result in this complication; infection spreads to the cavernous sinus via the pterygoid venous plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of odontogenic infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Otitis media and its related complication, mastoiditis, rarely result in cavernous sinus disease despite the frequency of these infections as a cause in the preantibiotic era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Mastoid infection can spread first to the lateral and sigmoid sinuses before reaching the cavernous sinuses via the inferior and superior petrosal sinuses. Infection can spread in a retrograde direction in this manner, depending upon the pressure gradients, because the dural sinuses contain no valves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early symptoms of cavernous sinus thrombosis are not specific, but the presence of cranial nerve signs (particularly lateral gaze palsy) on physical examination in a patient with headache should alert the clinician to the possibility of the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headache is the most common early symptom and generally precedes fever and periorbital edema by several days. Rarely, cavernous sinus infection can be a subacute or chronic process; in this case, headache can be present for several months prior to the onset of eye findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The character of the headache is generally sharp; the pain progressively increases in severity, interferes with sleep, and is not relieved by pain medications. The pain is generally localized to the dermatomes innervated by the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Thus, it is usually unilateral, involving the retroorbital and frontal areas with occasional radiation to the occipital region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The severe nature of the headache is the most common reason for patients to seek medical attention. Clinicians frequently misdiagnose the pain as migraine headache when the patient presents early in the course of the disorder, before the onset of neurological deficits.</p><p>Other symptoms that often accompany headache in this disorder include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye swelling that begins as a unilateral process but within 24 to 48 hours spreads via the intercavernous sinuses to produce swelling in the other eye</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diplopia, which occurs as oculomotor deficits develop</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alterations in mental status such as drowsiness, confusion, and coma can rapidly follow eye complaints. A depressed mental status occurs more commonly in older adult patients and in fatal cases.</p><p/><p>Less common complaints include photophobia, eye tearing, and ptosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When cavernous sinus septic thrombophlebitis is fully manifest, the physical findings are dramatic. Fever and the classic constellation of bilateral ptosis, proptosis, chemosis, and ocular muscle paralysis are present in the majority of such cases. However, the physical findings may be considerably subtler. A careful eye and neurologic examination, with particular attention to the cranial nerves, is necessary in order to make a diagnosis at an earlier stage.</p><p>Periorbital edema may be the earliest physical finding. Exophthalmos and chemosis are thought to result from occlusion of the ophthalmic veins and generally occur just before or at the same time as ophthalmoplegia. Funduscopic exam is abnormal in two-thirds of patients. Papilledema or dilated tortuous retinal veins are noted.</p><p>Ophthalmoplegia is an important finding and results from dysfunction of cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve) enervating the medial, superior, inferior recti, and the inferior oblique eye muscles; cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve) enervating the superior oblique muscle responsible for downward gaze, especially when the eye is adducted (turned inward); and cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve) enervating the lateral rectus muscle responsible for lateral gaze. These nerves are damaged by the extensive inflammation of the infected cavernous sinus. The following signs should be sought:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral gaze palsy (isolated cranial nerve VI dysfunction) may precede full-blown ophthalmoplegia, particularly in cases of chronic sphenoid sinusitis. Unlike cranial nerves III and IV that are located in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus and are protected by a fibrous sheath, the abducens nerve is situated medially in the cavernous sinus and is surrounded by blood, making it more susceptible to inflammatory damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drooping of the eyelid (ptosis), dilation of the pupil (mydriasis), and eye muscle weakness results from cranial nerve III dysfunction. Total palsy of the nerve leads to an eye that is facing down and lateral. Cranial nerve III also enervates the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which raises the eyelid, and contains parasympathetic fibers to the ciliary ganglion that regulates the sphincter muscle of the iris.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypo- or hyperesthesia in the dermatomes served by the ophthalmic (V<sub>1</sub>) and maxillary (V<sub>2</sub>) branches of the fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve) can be subtle but is virtually always present. To test for these, pain and light touch should be examined on the forehead, dorsum of the nose, and cornea (V<sub>1</sub>) and the upper lip, lateral nose, and upper cheek (V<sub>2</sub>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of visual acuity can arise from papilledema. Blindness caused by compression of the optic nerve by a mycotic aneurysm of the intercavernous segment of the internal <span class=\"nowrap\">carotid/ophthalmic</span> artery has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis can be difficult to differentiate from orbital cellulitis. Clinical characteristics that increase the probability of involvement of the cavernous sinus include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilated pupil or pupils</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Papilledema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fifth cranial nerve dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral eye involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)</p><p/><p>High-resolution computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can readily differentiate between the two diseases (see below).</p><p>Other conditions that can mimic septic cavernous sinus thrombosis include intraorbital abscess, allergic blepharitis, intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm or arteriovenous fistula, granulomatous inflammation of the superior orbital vein and cavernous sinus (Tolosa-Hunt syndrome), polyarteritis nodosa associated with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (Cogan syndrome), nasopharyngeal tumor, meningioma, and trauma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of a lumbar puncture can be supportive, but imaging studies are necessary to establish the diagnosis of septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">General laboratories and lumbar puncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The peripheral white blood cell count (WBC) is commonly elevated, suggesting an acute bacterial infection. Lumbar puncture is recommended for differentiating periorbital cellulitis from septic cavernous sinus thrombosis and may yield the offending pathogen. Lumbar puncture reveals inflammatory cells in 75 percent of cases. In half of these cases, the CSF profile is most suggestive of a parameningeal focus (elevated WBC with a predominance of polymorphonuclear neutrophils [PMNs] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mononuclear cells, normal glucose, elevated or occasionally normal protein, culture negative). In one-third of patients, the CSF formula is identical to that found in bacterial meningitis (elevated WBC with a predominance of PMN, low glucose, high protein, culture positive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Microbiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The organisms associated with septic cavernous sinus thrombosis reflect the primary sites of infection. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> accounts for 70 percent of all infections and is the etiologic pathogen in nearly all cases associated with facial infection or sphenoid sinusitis. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) is being reported with increasing frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Streptococci (including <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, <em>S. milleri</em>, and viridans group streptococci) are less commonly found. Anaerobes are occasionally cultured, including <em>Bacteroides</em> spp and <em>Fusobacterium</em> spp, and are most often found with accompanying sinus, dental, or tonsillar infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/2,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12-14</a>].</p><p>Fungal pathogens have been less commonly reported and include <em>Rhizopus</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/2,10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,15</a>] and other agents of mucormycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], <em>Aspergillus</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and <em>Schizophyllum commune</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-resolution orbital CT scan with contrast or MRI with gadolinium enhancement both readily demonstrate septic cavernous vein thrombosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71777\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71777 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

This segment of the carotid artery spasms and may even thrombose in response to the intense inflammation present in the infected cavernous sinus. MRI and CT scan also readily demonstrate narrowing or occlusion of the internal carotid artery and are now the preferred imaging techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of therapy for septic cavernous sinus thrombosis is antibiotics, although anticoagulation and surgery are appropriate adjunctive treatments in selected cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-dose intravenous antibiotics should be instituted emergently and directed at the probable organisms causing this type of infection. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Because thrombus may limit the penetration of antibiotics, prolonged high-dose intravenous antibiotics are recommended. A minimum of three weeks of treatment is generally required to assure sterilization.</p><p>Empiric therapy should include coverage for community-acquired MRSA with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose intravenously [IV] every 8 to 12 hours, not to exceed 2 g per dose). If susceptibility testing reveals methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus</em>, vancomycin should be replaced with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafcillin</a> (2 g IV every four hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a> (2 g IV every four hours). An agent with activity against <em>S. aureus</em> should be combined with a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (2 g IV every 12 hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a> (2 g IV every 8 to 12 hours); the latter agent is preferred if <em>Pseudomonas </em>coverage is desired. Anaerobic coverage should be added if a dental or sinus infection is suspected. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (500 mg every eight hours) is highly effective for this purpose. For brain abscess, higher doses of metronidazole (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> loading dose [usually 1 g] followed by 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [usually 500 mg] every six hours) are recommended.</p><p>Antifungal therapy is rarely required and should only be utilized if invasive fungal infection is proven by biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24487009\"><span class=\"h4\">MRSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given substantial rates of MRSA infections, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose IV every 8 to 12 hours, not to exceed 2 g per dose unless serum concentrations are inappropriately low) should be used as initial therapy when <em>S. aureus</em> is suspected or proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. If susceptibility testing reveals methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus</em>, therapy should be changed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafcillin</a> (2 g IV every four hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a> (2 g IV every four hours). If the organism is methicillin resistant, vancomycin should be continued and dosed to achieve serum trough concentrations of 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. A significant drawback to vancomycin is its poor penetration into the CSF of approximately 1 and 5 percent with uninflamed and inflamed meninges, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> can be added to vancomycin at a dose of 600 mg orally once daily or 300 to 450 mg twice daily because it achieves bactericidal concentrations in the CSF regardless of meningeal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/23,24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,28</a>], although there are few data to support this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].<br/><br/>Based upon case reports and case series of patients with central nervous system (CNS) infections caused by MRSA, alternatives to vancomycin include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> (600 mg IV or orally twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/11,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,32-34</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 8 to 12 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/24,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,35,36</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daptomycin</a> (6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV once daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Although there are insufficient data regarding the efficacy of these regimens for the treatment of CNS infections caused by MRSA, these agents are reasonable alternatives when vancomycin cannot be used or is ineffective. Further studies are needed to establish the benefit of these agents for the treatment of CNS infections.

A prospective trial has not been performed due to the rarity of the syndrome. One retrospective study demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality in patients with unilateral involvement who presented early and who received heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a second retrospective analysis, the addition of early anticoagulation to antibiotic treatment did not affect mortality but did decrease morbidity, including ophthalmoplegia, blindness, stroke, hypopituitarism, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Complications associated with heparinization were rare. A study of central nervous system venous thrombosis associated with head or neck infections found no significant increase in intracranial hemorrhage in patients receiving heparin compared with patients not receiving heparin; however, the number of patients was small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Based upon these limited observations and pending better prospective data, we suggest early heparinization in patients with unilateral cavernous sinus thrombosis. The use of anticoagulation in patients with cavernous sinus thrombosis who have associated intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to venous infarction is even less well studied, but careful anticoagulation in such patients may be appropriate. In contrast, anticoagulation is contraindicated in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (eg, hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage).</p><p>The related condition of aseptic acute cerebral venous thrombosis is discussed separately.

In recent years, the use of sinus CT scans has markedly enhanced the ability to diagnose this dangerous air sinus infection.

Infection spreads from this site directly to the epidural space overlying the lateral sinus or spreads via emissary veins. The majority of individuals have a right dominant venous circulation in which the superior sagittal sinus drains into the right lateral sinus. Less commonly, a left dominant circulation is present. Occlusion of the dominant lateral sinus interferes with venous drainage of the superior sagittal sinus. Because the arachnoid villi responsible for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resorption drain into this sinus, thrombosis of the dominant lateral dural sinus results in communicating hydrocephalus, sometimes called otitic hydrocephalus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Septic lateral sinus thrombosis has a subacute onset.

Failure to seek medical attention or treatment with inappropriate antibiotics results in spread of the infection to the mastoid and subsequently to the epidural space. Headache generally is severe, persistent, and localized to the fronto-temporo-occipital region on the side of the ear infection. Pain is thought to be a manifestation of a developing epidural abscess, irritation of the fifth cranial nerve, or thrombosis of the lateral sinus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-epidural-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial epidural abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nausea and vomiting develop in nearly half of cases and can be mistaken for severe gastroenteritis. This manifestation may reflect irritation of the brainstem or elevated CSF pressure. Other symptoms include vertigo, diplopia, photophobia, and neck stiffness. Some patients develop cough productive of bloody sputum that results from septic pulmonary emboli (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever is present in 80 percent of cases, and patients often appear toxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An abnormal ear examination is found in virtually all patients; 40 percent have a ruptured tympanic membrane and 20 percent a dull, erythematous tympanic membrane. Posterior auricular swelling is found in over half of the cases and is caused by occlusion of the mastoid emissary veins. This finding is called the Gresinger sign.</p><p>Bilateral papilledema (the result of elevated CSF pressure) is also present in half of the cases and may be associated with retinal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Accompanying loss of visual acuity develops in 15 percent. Unilateral sixth nerve dysfunction is reported in over a third of cases and is thought to be caused by compression of the nerve by swelling of the inferior petrosal sinus within the closed space of Dorello's canal.</p><p>Otitis media, sixth nerve paralysis, and fifth cranial nerve irritation (temporoparietal and retroorbital pain) is known as Gradenigo syndrome. When present, this symptom complex provides strong evidence for lateral sinus thrombosis or inflammation of the petrous ridge of the temporal bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Nuchal rigidity is present in one-third of patients and is probably the result of meningeal inflammation.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the diagnostic study of choice. T1-weighted images can readily detect methemoglobin in thrombosed vessels, resulting in a marked increase in signal intensity. Magnetic resonance gadolinium angiography can also be used to assess venous flow. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance gradient-echo cerebral venography has been shown to be superior to two-dimensional magnetic resonance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Lumbar puncture should be performed in all cases after MRI or computed tomography (CT) has excluded the possibility of brain abscess. CSF pressures are commonly elevated to the range of 450 to 500 mmH<sub>2</sub>O in 75 percent of cases. Increased CSF pressure results from interference with CSF resorption by arachnoid villi draining into the superior sagittal sinus. The CSF formula is normal in two-thirds of cases and reflects parameningeal inflammation in the other third. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'General laboratories and lumbar puncture'</a> above.)</p><p>Chest radiography rarely reveals rounded densities.

A regimen containing a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> 2 g IV every 12 hours or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a> 2 g IV every 8 to 12 hours) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (500 mg IV every eight hours) should be initiated pending cultures. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Meropenem</a> (2 g IV every eight hours) is an acceptable alternative. If meropenem is not available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> (500 mg or 1 g IV every six hours) can be used. If both agents are available, we prefer meropenem since imipenem may increase the risk of seizures. Methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) is rare; however, in the acutely ill patient, the empiric addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV per day in two divided doses, not to exceed 2 g per 24 hours unless serum concentrations are inappropriately low) may be warranted.</p><p>Once the results of intraoperative cultures are available, therapy should be changed to target the identified organisms based upon their antibiotic sensitivities.

During surgery, the area overlying the lateral sinus should be explored so that infected granulation tissue or purulent collections can be drained. Removal of thrombus from the lateral sinus is not recommended because recanalization or the development of collateral venous drainage occurs once the infection has been controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Similarly, ligation of the jugular vein, a common procedure in the preantibiotic era, is not recommended.</p><p>Not all cases of lateral sinus thrombosis require mastoidectomy with drainage. In one pediatric series, three of five patients responded quickly to antibiotic therapy and myringotomy, fully recovering without more aggressive surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Also, patients with acute aseptic dural sinus thrombosis who received anticoagulation had no apparent ill effects.

(See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>The outcome of complete occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus is universally fatal. Occlusion of the anterior segment in association with frontal sinusitis presents with mild to moderate headache and spontaneously resolves following the development of collateral venous channels. Although anticoagulants and thrombolytic therapy are often administered in aseptic superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, their role in septic disease has not been defined, and, given the extensive intracerebral hemorrhage and the rapid progression to death, they are unlikely to be of benefit. Antibiotics, if begun early for bacterial meningitis, can prevent this complication from occurring; however, once occlusion has occurred, initiation of antibiotics is unlikely to be of significant benefit for this complication.
