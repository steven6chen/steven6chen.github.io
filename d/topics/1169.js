Epithelial ovarian carcinoma is the most common histologic type of ovarian cancer and is closely related to fallopian tubal and peritoneal carcinomas. These will be referred to as a single entity here, as epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC).</p><p>Five-year survival rates for stage III or IV EOC are &lt;50 percent and &lt;20 percent, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64569 \">table 1</a>). However, in 2016 there were more than 230,000 EOC survivors in the United States and there are some long-term survivors of EOC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-survivors-of-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Issues pertaining to survivorship in EOC are not well-studied. This may be due to the overall poor prognosis of women with ovarian cancer and smaller populations of affected individuals compared with patients with other cancers (eg, endometrial or breast cancer). Additionally, there are many studies of ovarian cancer survivors and their difficulties, but there are few data to guide management. Nevertheless, survivorship-related issues are important to address in this growing population of women. </p><p>The approach to survivors of EOC will be reviewed here.

Most gynecologic oncologists contributing to UpToDate continue to follow CA 125 levels even in long-term survivors, if they were elevated at the time of active disease.</p><p>Following patients longitudinally by CA 125 may help identify patients for surgical treatment at recurrence and thereby increase the likelihood of an optimal cytoreduction. In a study of 74 women with recurrent EOC who underwent secondary cytoreduction, patients who had an optimal cytoreduction had a shorter time interval between their initial rise in CA 125 compared with those who had a suboptimal cytoreduction (5 versus 16 weeks; hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06), suggesting that acting expeditiously upon a rising CA 125 level may improve surgical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-survivors-of-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-carcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Whether early surgical intervention for recurrent disease improves survival outcomes is being evaluated in a randomized trial conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00565851&amp;token=YbJELcAW9G3aZfZrjTwgllXLsXNNrpAr426VqXdy7dL65ww9niIcFAxOxZ/H8wEYZTc04xIflK6nJqwrjWctwg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=17007\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">GOG 213</a>).</p><p>Despite these findings, there is no clear impact of serial CA 125 measurements on overall survival. This was shown in the Medical Research Council (MRC) 05 trial in which 1442 women had their CA 125 levels checked every three months, with both patients and investigators blinded to the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-survivors-of-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-carcinoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Women who remained asymptomatic but whose CA 125 levels exceeded twice the upper limit of normal (n = 527) were randomly assigned to immediate treatment or to continued blinding of the CA 125 results with treatment delayed until the time of a clinical or symptomatic recurrence. Women who developed symptoms or signs of a recurrence were removed from the study. The main results of this study were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second-line chemotherapy was started a median of five months earlier in the immediate treatment arm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At a median follow-up of 57 months from randomization, there was no improvement in overall survival with immediate compared with delayed treatment (HR for death 0.98, 95% CI 0.80-1.20).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate treatment was not associated with a longer remission duration following the detection of recurrence. However, it resulted in an adverse impact on quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H554516035\"><span class=\"h2\">No role for routine imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard imaging techniques, including ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), have limited sensitivity to detect recurrent EOC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-survivors-of-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There are some data to support the use of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> to detect early recurrent disease, but in the absence of data to suggest this improves survival, we do not perform imaging studies in otherwise asymptomatic women as part of surveillance. </p><p>As an example, the role of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging was evaluated in a 2013 meta-analysis that included 29 trials (n = 1651) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-survivors-of-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> had a sensitivity and specificity of 89 and 90 percent, respectively, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.1 (95% CI 3.9-9.5) and 0.12 (95% CI 0.08-0.19), respectively. However, all studies were observational and the recurrent disease was not uniformly confirmed histologically; the analysis included studies in which recurrence was based solely on repeat imaging at six months. Whether earlier detection of recurrent EOC by <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> expanded treatment options or improved survival was not reported. </p><p>Therefore, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> should not be used as part of routine surveillance for women treated for EOC. On the other hand, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> may be useful in the evaluation of a rising CA 125 to assess for extent of disease, anticipating further discussion regarding the role of surgery and timing of treatment, pending the results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45344932\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast cancer risk management in BRCA mutation carriers with EOC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have been treated for EOC should be counseled about genetic testing if it has not already been done. Women with an inherited germline mutation in the <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> gene are at increased risk of developing breast cancer, regardless of whether they have had EOC. However, there is no consensus on the most appropriate management of breast cancer risk in these patients. While prophylactic mastectomy is a reasonable option for these patients, surveillance with mammography and clinical examination may be a reasonable alternative, particularly for those women diagnosed with advanced-stage EOC in whom the risk of EOC recurrence is greatest.

The pooled analysis of all studies found a significantly higher OS with HT compared with no HT (risk of death: HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.61-0.79). However, in observational studies, it is uncertain whether the women treated with HT started with a better prognosis. No increase in recurrence rate was found with HT use for all participants (relative risk [RR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.64-1.07), and also no increase in recurrence in subanalyses by grade or stage (eg, stage III to IV disease: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73-1.20) was found. A limitation of this analysis is that follow-up ranged widely across studies from &lt;1 year to &gt;5 years.</p><p>A subsequent large retrospective cohort study (n = 357) found that women age &lt;55 years with EOC treated with HT for longer than 12 months compared with no HT had a significant increase in three-year disease-free survival (94.4 versus 64.7 percent) and OS (94.6 versus 73.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-survivors-of-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-carcinoma/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is closely related to fallopian tubal and peritoneal carcinomas. Five-year survival rates for stage III or IV EOC are &lt;50 percent and &lt;20 percent, respectively; however, in 2016 there were more than 230,000 EOC survivors in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H891966246\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma are surgically staged, including total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection, and omentectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 2</a>). Most women are diagnosed with stage III or IV disease and will undergo surgical staging followed by combination chemotherapy consisting of a platinum salt (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>) plus a taxane (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1051211720\" class=\"local\">'Overview of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up office visits (including history, general physical, and pelvic examinations) should occur every two to four months for two years, then every three to six months for three years, then annually after five years. Cancer antigen (CA) 125 or other tumor markers (eg, human epididymis protein 4 [HE4]) should be checked at every visit, if these markers were elevated at the initial presentation. Other testing (ie, chemistry profile or complete blood count, or imaging) should be pursued only if clinically indicated (eg, for a rise in CA 125 or new or worsening symptom). (See <a href=\"#H412742059\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent neurotoxicity is an important quality of life (QOL) issue for long-term survivors and is most commonly due to the adverse effects of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-survivors-of-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-carcinoma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The treatment approach to chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy#H523404540\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue is an obstacle to daily functioning and a contributor to decreased QOL. In women with EOC, fatigue may persist after completion of chemotherapy and can be moderately distressing and difficult to control. (See <a href=\"#H891966304\" class=\"local\">'Fatigue'</a> above.)<br/></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian cancer survivors often suffer from significant bowel function disorders, including constipation and diarrhea, both during and after primary therapy. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms correlate with poorer QOL in EOC survivors. Women with EOC who experience new GI symptoms should be evaluated for disease recurrence, using history, physical exam, and imaging studies (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">[PET]/CT,</span> or PET). (See <a href=\"#H891966311\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual function issues are common among EOC survivors. Sexual problems may be secondary to effects of surgery, chemotherapy, or menopause, or may be due to a partner&rsquo;s sexual issues or relationship problems. Women may complain of dyspareunia, loss of desire, or other sexual dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H891966334\" class=\"local\">'Sexual dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with EOC who have bothersome menopausal symptoms, and who are healthy, &lt;60 years old, and have failed or declined nonhormonal treatments, we suggest hormone therapy (HT) rather than no treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Studies of ovarian cancer always include cases of primary fallopian tube and peritoneal carcinoma, and thus, it is also reasonable to use HT for these women. (See <a href=\"#H2548017434\" class=\"local\">'Systemic menopausal symptoms or effects'</a> above.)<br/></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with EOC experience some level of ongoing psychological distress. These emotional challenges may persist for years after diagnosis. Depression and anxiety are common in ovarian cancer survivors.
