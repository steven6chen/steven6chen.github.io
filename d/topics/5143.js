Additionally, screening for chronic HCV infection is recommended for certain patients regardless of clinical findings if they have an individual risk factor for exposure or belong to certain demographic groups that have a high-prevalence of infection, including those born between 1945 and 1965. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692855539\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND TESTING APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of chronic HCV infection is usually made in a patient with a reactive HCV antibody test and a positive molecular test that detects the presence of HCV RNA. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H805054550\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing algorithm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial diagnostic evaluation for chronic HCV typically begins with an antibody test. A reactive or <span class=\"nowrap\">indeterminate/equivocal</span> antibody test should be followed by HCV RNA testing. For patients who have a greater likelihood of false negative antibody testing (eg, severely immunocompromised or hemodialysis patients or those suspected of having acute hepatitis C), HCV RNA testing should be sent at the same time as antibody testing.</p><p>If HCV RNA is detected, the diagnosis of HCV infection is confirmed. If HCV RNA is not detected, then a reactive antibody likely represents either a past HCV infection that subsequently was cleared or a false-positive antibody test. The different testing outcomes are discussed in further detail below. (See <a href=\"#H1030815605\" class=\"local\">'Nonreactive anti-HCV antibody'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1030815984\" class=\"local\">'Reactive antibody and positive RNA test'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1030816265\" class=\"local\">'Reactive antibody and negative RNA test'</a> below.)</p><p>Several different antibody tests are available, including laboratory based immunoassays, rapid point-of-care tests, and home-based tests, and all can be used as the initial assay for antibody testing for HCV. (See <a href=\"#H1128802934\" class=\"local\">'Antibody testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Quantitative HCV RNA tests used to confirm the diagnosis should have a detection level of 25 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> or lower. If the available quantitative test does not have that level of sensitivity, then a qualitative test should be used for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H614242902\" class=\"local\">'HCV RNA assays'</a> below.)</p><p>These recommendations are consistent with the joint HCV guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>In resource-limited locations or other settings where HCV RNA testing is not accessible, HCV core antigen testing may be a more affordable alternative, if available. (See <a href=\"#H1334192702\" class=\"local\">'HCV core antigen test'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1030815605\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonreactive anti-HCV antibody</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the antibody test is nonreactive, then chronic HCV infection is unlikely and testing can stop. </p><p>In occasional situations, however, patients may lack detectable levels of anti-HCV antibodies despite having an HCV infection, and thus testing for HCV RNA despite a nonreactive antibody test is important to exclude infection. These include severely immunocompromised patients, patients on hemodialysis, and those who are suspected of having acute HCV infection because of symptoms or recent exposures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1030815927\"><span class=\"h3\">Severely immunocompromised and hemodialysis patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients on hemodialysis, transplant recipients, and those with advanced HIV infection may have a higher rate of false negative antibody testing than immunocompetent patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Thus, HCV RNA testing should be performed in such patients regardless of the results of antibody testing. HCV infection is diagnosed if the HCV RNA is positive, even if the HCV antibody test is nonreactive. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1030815689\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with acute hepatitis or recent exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients suspected of having acute HCV infection, either because of symptoms or signs consistent with acute hepatitis or because of a recent exposure, HCV RNA should be checked at the same time as antibody testing. Following exposure, HCV RNA becomes detectable prior to reactive antibodies. Most patients develop detectable antibodies between two and six months after exposure. Antibody testing is positive in 50 percent of patients with acute HCV infection at the time of presentation, and in 90 percent at some time during the acute illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Testing for HCV RNA allows earlier diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of acute hepatitis C virus infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1030815984\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactive antibody and positive RNA test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive HCV RNA result is evidence of HCV infection. Usually, patients who have both reactive anti-HCV antibody and detectable HCV RNA have chronic infection. However, in some cases, patients acutely infected with HCV will also have a reactive antibody test and positive HCV RNA. In these cases, the distinction between acute and chronic hepatitis C is difficult and must take into account recent exposures, the presence of symptoms, prior HCV and aminotransferase testing results, and patterns of HCV RNA levels over time. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-acute-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-adults#H936453016\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of acute hepatitis C virus infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Patients with acute hepatitis'</a>.) </p><p>For patients diagnosed with HCV infection, linking to medical care for further evaluation is important. This includes assessment of the extent of liver disease through physical exam, laboratory testing, and consideration of liver biopsy. Additionally, HCV RNA quantification (if diagnosis was made with a qualitative RNA test) and HCV genotype testing are important for patients in whom treatment is being considered. (See <a href=\"#H1030816060\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1030816265\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactive antibody and negative RNA test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absence of detectable HCV RNA essentially confirms the absence of chronic HCV infection. False negative tests for RNA are unusual when sensitive quantitative or qualitative tests with a low level of detection (eg, &lt;50 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> are used.</p><p>In this situation, the reactive anti-HCV antibody most likely represents prior infection that subsequently cleared spontaneously (or following successful therapy) or a false-positive antibody test due to technical reasons. The estimated rate of spontaneous clearance of virus after infection is 20 to 45 percent depending upon the age and immune status of the individual at the time of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p>If the distinction between these two possibilities needs to be made, a different antibody test can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A nonreactive second antibody test suggests that the initial test was a false-positive. Repeatedly reactive results from different antibody assays suggest a prior, cleared infection. Neither outcome is conclusive, however. As an alternative, the signal-to-cutoff <span class=\"nowrap\">(S/CO)</span> ratio, which is generally reported in the results, can be helpful in determining if a reactive antibody test is a true positive. The <span class=\"nowrap\">S/CO</span> ratio that predicts a &gt;95 percent probability of true positivity varies by the specific immunoassay used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F90942\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90942 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H692856105\" class=\"local\">'Standard immunoassay testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Other less frequent situations may result in a reactive antibody and negative RNA test:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of anti-HCV antibodies that have been passively acquired from blood transfusions. In this situation, anti-HCV disappears over the next few weeks in keeping with the half-life of IgG. This is now extremely unusual because of improved testing of the blood supply.

It is unclear how frequent this phenomenon occurs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amount of HCV RNA may be below the limit of detection of the assay or there may be other technical problems with the test. This is less of an issue when currently available sensitive qualitative (TMA) and quantitative (real-time PCR) assays are used.

These immunoassays have many advantages in the diagnostic setting, including ease of use, low variability, ease of automation, and relatively low expense. There are several generations of immunoassay tests, which detect antibodies that target different viral antigens and vary in accuracy. </p><p>The hepatitis C virus is a small 40 to 60 nm virus with a lipid envelope and a single-stranded RNA viral genome comprising approximately 9500 nucleotides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The N-terminus encodes the basic nucleocapsid (C) followed by two glycoprotein domains, the envelope (E1), and second <span class=\"nowrap\">envelope/nonstructural-1</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(E2/NS1)</span> regions. Downstream to this region are the genes encoding nonstructural proteins NS2, NS3, NS4, and NS5, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-c-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of the hepatitis C virus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The latest, third generation EIAs (EIA-3) generally detect antibodies to recombinant antigens from the core, NS3, NS4, and NS5 proteins. These tests have very high sensitivity and high specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. Anti-HCV EIA tests become positive as early as eight weeks after exposure, with most patients seroconverting between two and six months after exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. The signal-to-cutoff <span class=\"nowrap\">(S/CO)</span> ratio that predicts a &gt;95 percent probability of true positivity varies by the specific immunoassay used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F90942\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90942 \">table 2</a>). In a systematic review of studies that evaluated the accuracy of EIA-3 using detection of HCV RNA as a reference, the pooled sensitivity was 97.2 percent (95% CI 92-99) among 143 patients with evidence of hepatitis and 98.9 percent (CI 94-10) on a panel of 90 serum samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Specificity was 100 percent among 84 patients with either evidence of hepatitis or undergoing hemodialysis. Compared with earlier generation tests, the EIA-3 has slightly better specificity in the blood donor population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18</a>]. As an example, in a study of 2620 donor blood samples that were repeatedly reactive with a third generation EIA assay at a specific signal level, the sensitivity and specificity was 89 and 93 percent, respectively, compared with an immunoblot assay. (See <a href=\"#H1128802474\" class=\"local\">'Recombinant immunoblot assay'</a> below.)</p><p>However, in certain parts of the world, third generation EIAs may be associated with a high rate of false positivity. In a study of 1000 individuals in Uganda who had not been previously treated for HCV infection, the prevalence of anti-HCV positivity by third generation EIA was 7.6 percent, but HCV RNA was not detected in any of those cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A reactive anti-HCV EIA was associated with a reactive Schistosoma EIA, suggesting the possibility of cross-reactivity, but the study was not able to distinguish cleared infection from false EIA positivity. </p><p>Chemiluminescence immunoassays are becoming widely used, especially in clinical laboratories with high volumes. Their performance is comparable to third generation EIAs, and may even offer slightly improved specificity in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p>The second generation version of the EIA test, EIA-2, detects antibodies to recombinant antigens from the core (C22) and nonstructural regions 3 (C33) and 4 (C100) of HCV. Although now used less frequently than later generation assays, EIA-2 is still available. It is not quite as sensitive and specific as later generation tests. Overall, EIA-2 testing allows detection of anti-HCV in about 95 percent of individuals with HCV as confirmed by highly sensitive molecular tests such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] or transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The positive predictive value of the EIA-2 is lower (50 to 61 percent) in lower prevalence populations such as blood donors. The mean time to seroconversion with EIA-2 after blood transfusion is 10 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV infection, patients on dialysis, and transplant recipients, anti-HCV may not be detectable despite the presence of HCV infection, particularly when earlier generation EIA tests are used. Additionally, patients with acute HCV infection may not yet have developed anti-HCV antibodies. For these patients at risk for HCV infection or in whom HCV is suspected (such as those with an elevated serum ALT level), HCV RNA testing should be considered even if anti-HCV tests are negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/3,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24,25</a>].

These tests can be run on venous blood, finger stick blood, serum, plasma, and oral fluid, and results are generally available in less than 30 minutes. The tests are designed for point-of-care testing to provide increased opportunities for HCV testing outside of traditional clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, one rapid test (OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody Test, OraSure Technologies, Inc, Bethlehem, PA) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Although the test can be performed on various patient specimens, tests run on venous blood and finger stick blood have been approved for use in facilities that can perform Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)-waived tests, such as outreach clinics, community-based organizations, and clinician offices. The test is performed on a test strip and does not require additional equipment. Data suggest that the sensitivity and specificity of the test are equivalent to EIA testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a study of over 2000 patients with risk factors for HCV infection, the OraQuick rapid test on blood derived specimens (serum, plasma, venous blood, or fingerstick) had a sensitivity of 99.7 to 99.9 percent (95% CI 99 to 100) and specificity of 99.9 percent (95% CI 99.5 to 100). Sensitivity was slightly lower for oral fluid, at 98.1 percent (95% CI 96.9 to 99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Consumption of tobacco and most types of food and drink do not affect specificity or sensitivity with a minimum wait time of five minutes. However, a low rate of false positive results were observed when testing was performed five minutes following the use of mouthwash, tooth whitening or brushing, and consumption of soda, but these was corrected by extending the wait times prior to testing.</p><p>In a meta-analysis that included 18 trials, point-of-care tests on whole blood or fingersticks had pooled sensitivities of 98.9 percent (95% CI 94.5 to 99.8) and specificities of 99.5 percent (97.5 to 99.9) for diagnosing HCV infection as compared with immunoassay detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, certain tests perform better than others. As an example, in one study, 1100 specimens from patients with a history of injection drug use were tested with the of OraQuick test, the Multiplo Rapid <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV</span> Antibody Test (MedMira, Inc, Halifax, Nova Scotia) and the Chembio Dual Path Platform (DPP) HCV Test (Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc, Medford, NY) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The differences in sensitivities between the OraQuick (98 to 99 percent), Multiplo (87 to 88 percent), and Chembio (96 to 98 percent) tests were all statistically significant. There were no differences among the three tests with regard to specificity (all were greater than 99 percent specific).</p><p>A dried blood spot of capillary blood obtained by a finger stick, which is then transported to a laboratory with high throughput EIA testing, is an accurate diagnostic sample that can be useful for resource-limited settings. In a pooled quantitative meta-analysis of 19 studies, the sensitivity and specificity were 98 and 99 percent, respectively, compared with testing on venous blood samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692856298\"><span class=\"h3\">Self-collected tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An over-the-counter antibody testing kit (&quot;Hepatitis C Check&quot; [Home Access Health Corp.]) has been approved by the FDA.

It is no longer available in the United States but may be available in other parts of the world and has been used in earlier studies to determine the performance of immunoassays. </p><p>In locations where the RIBA remains available, it can help distinguish between past infection (RIBA positive) and false-positive antibody testing (RIBA negative) in individuals who have a reactive immunoassay and a negative HCV RNA test. RIBA can also be interpreted as indeterminate, in which case, other testing must be done to make the distinction.

The lower limit of detection (ie, the lowest viral level that can be detected) with most currently available quantitative tests is comparable to that of qualitative tests. Thus, quantitative tests can be used for detection of infection. Most patients with chronic HCV infection will have HCV RNA much greater than the lower level of detection of quantitative tests.

Results can vary between assays, especially for some non-1 HCV genotype specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. As a result, serial measurements of HCV RNA during treatment should ideally be performed using the same assay throughout.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H970881615\"><span class=\"h3\">Methods of RNA detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several methods can be used to detect and measure HCV RNA and have varying levels of sensitivity. These include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods, transcription mediated amplification (TMA), and branched DNA testing. </p><p>PCR-based methods, called target amplification, involve extraction of nucleic acid from the virus. The nucleic acid is then hybridized to short nucleotide primers, which are complementary to the virus sequence and amplified through controlled, repeated cycles of replication of the hybridized sequence until a quantity of DNA sufficient for detection is reached. The most sensitive standard PCR assays detect HCV RNA at concentrations of 25 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> or lower in patient serum. </p><p>Real time PCR includes the use of a probe hybridized to a reporter dye that can bind to the amplified product to create a signal. By comparing the signal intensity to a standard curve of control samples of known copy level, the target HCV RNA can be quantified. Real-time PCR methods have largely replaced standard PCR methods in clinical laboratories for HCV level testing. These assays have greater sensitivity with lower detection limits of approximately 15 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> and a wide linear dynamic range (7 to 8 log(10) international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span>. In addition, since real-time PCR methods do not require specimen pre-dilution, the risk of carryover contamination (which may lead to false positive HCV RNA results) is eliminated.</p><p>TMA-based methods, like PCR, amplify target HCV RNA. The TMA-based method captures the extracted virus using magnetic microbeads and the subsequent amplification of DNA by reverse transcription occurs in an isothermal, autocatalytic fashion rather than the cycling conditions used for PCR. Like PCR, the amplified DNA is labeled with a detection probe and the amplified amount of virus determined by comparison to internal negative controls. TMA methods detect HCV RNA at concentrations of approximately 10 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. </p><p>Signal amplification technologies such as bDNA do not amplify the viral nucleic acid, but rather hybridize it to specific probes that are more easily amplified for detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The bDNA assay is technically easier, less variable, and has a lower chance of cross-contamination than standard target amplification techniques. However, signal amplification lacks the sensitivity of PCR-based methods, with a lower limit of detection of 615 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>.</p><p>HCV RNA detection methods are traditionally performed on serum or plasma samples. Testing of dried blood spots prepared from a whole blood specimen obtained by finger-stick also appears relatively accurate, with a lower detection limit as low as 250 to 500 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> in some cases, and could be a useful tool in resource-limited settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1128802950\"><span class=\"h3\">Quantitative tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quantitative assays assess the quantity of HCV RNA in international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> and vary in their limits of detection and dynamic range. In the past, these assays were less sensitive than qualitative assays and were therefore not used for detection of infection or confirmation of viral clearance. Real-time PCR methods are widely available. These assays are more sensitive than prior quantitative assays (lower limits of detection of approximately 10 to 15 international units <span class=\"nowrap\">/mL)</span> and have a wide dynamic range (7 to 8 log(10) international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span>. Thus, the real-time PCR assays offer the combined diagnostic capabilities of qualitative and quantitative assays.</p><p>Quantitative assays are used before treatment to measure baseline HCV viral load. Quantitative assays may also be used during and after treatment to assess on-treatment response and to assess response to therapy. However, most direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens with newly available DAAs have very high rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), and on-treatment monitoring of HCV viral load is not necessary. </p><p>Quantitative assays have both a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ, the lowest viral level that can be quantified) and a lower limit of detection (LLOD, the lowest viral level that can be detected). The LLOD does not always correspond to the LLOQ for a test, and thus a viral level may be unquantifiable but detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Outside of the context of treatment, serial HCV RNA measurements in those with chronic infection are not needed since the viral load does not have prognostic value. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H970881627\"><span class=\"h3\">Qualitative tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Qualitative tests are capable of detecting low levels of HCV RNA and are used for confirming the diagnosis of HCV infection and assessing SVR to antiviral therapy. They provide results as positive or negative and some have a lower limit of detection as low as &lt;10 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> HCV RNA. Examples of qualitative HCV RNA assays are Amplicor PCR assay (Roche Diagnostics) and Versant TMA assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). (See <a href=\"#H970881615\" class=\"local\">'Methods of RNA detection'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1334192702\"><span class=\"h2\">HCV core antigen test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several immunoassays have been developed to detect the HCV core (HCV cAg) protein, a component of the viral particle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In resource-limited settings where nuclear acid testing (NAT) is not available, WHO guidelines recommend that an HCV cAg test be used instead to confirm viremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>In a systematic review of studies evaluating the accuracy of such tests, the most studied assays (Abbott ARCHITECT HCV Ag assay and the Ortho HCV Ag ELISA) had good performance, with pooled sensitivities and specificities for detecting HCV viremia of approximately 93 and 99 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The ARCHITECT HCV Ag assay performed well in identifying infected individuals with HCV RNA level &gt;3000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. The Hunan Jynda Bioengineering Group HCV Ag ELISA assay had poor performance.</p><p>There were limited data on performance of these tests in individuals with HIV or hepatitis B virus coinfection and with genotypes 4, 5, and 6 HCV infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1030816060\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important aspects of initial care of the patient newly diagnosed with HCV involve evaluating the extent of liver damage and determining candidacy for treatment.

Initial diagnostic evaluation for chronic HCV typically begins with an antibody test. (See <a href=\"#H692855539\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and testing approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the antibody test is nonreactive, then chronic HCV infection is unlikely and testing can stop. Patients who are on dialysis, are severely immunocompromised, or are suspected of having an acute HCV infection may not have detectable anti-HCV antibodies despite the presence of infection; in such patients, HCV RNA testing despite a nonreactive antibody test is important to exclude infection. (See <a href=\"#H1030815605\" class=\"local\">'Nonreactive anti-HCV antibody'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnostic approach to suspected acute hepatitis C is presented separately.

Usually, patients who have both reactive anti-HCV antibody and detectable HCV RNA have chronic infection, although these may also be seen in some acutely infected patients.

False negative tests for RNA are unusual when sensitive quantitative or qualitative tests with a low level of detection are used. A reactive antibody test in this setting is generally reflective of a false positive or past, cleared infection. (See <a href=\"#H1030816265\" class=\"local\">'Reactive antibody and negative RNA test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies to HCV can be detected using a number of assays, including standard immunoassays that are performed in a laboratory, rapid immunoassays that can be performed at the point-of-care, and home tests on specimens self-collected by the patient. Nucleic acid tests (NAT) for detection of HCV RNA have been traditionally divided into two categories: qualitative and quantitative assays. Most currently available quantitative tests have a lower level of detection that is comparable to qualitative tests.
