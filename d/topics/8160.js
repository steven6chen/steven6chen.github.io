The transmission of HCV through kidney transplantation is rare due to screening of donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Transplant candidates who were previously successfully treated for HCV infection should be rescreened at least annually.</p><p>In low-prevalence countries, anti-HCV antibody testing would be adequate to rule out HCV infection when the test is negative, but a positive antibody test should be confirmed with RNA testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, all transplant candidates in high-prevalence areas should be screened by testing for HCV RNA as false-negative anti-HCV antibody tests have been reported to be as high as 17.9 percent in dialysis units in countries with high HCV prevalence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The reason to screen patients is that, with advances in HCV antiviral therapy, HCV infection can be successfully cured in the majority of patients, either before or after transplant. In addition, some centers offer kidneys from HCV-positive donors to HCV-positive recipients, which could shorten the waiting time for the recipient. HCV infection in the potential recipient is <strong>not</strong> a contraindication to kidney transplantation. Although HCV infection prior to transplantation increases posttransplantation morbidity and mortality, even in the absence of cirrhosis, HCV-infected patients have a lower mortality following transplantation compared with mortality on dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H888895258\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>We do not test patients who are negative for HCV RNA for occult HCV infection. Occult HCV infection is defined as the detection of HCV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatocytes in the absence of positive HCV RNA in the serum. The prevalence of occult HCV infection has been found to be very low in renal transplant recipients; therefore, routine screening is not warranted in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1294399114\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver biopsy for HCV-infected patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with KDIGO that all HCV-infected transplant candidates should undergo a liver biopsy prior to transplantation in order to exclude cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The presence of cirrhosis on biopsy has been associated with a very poor prognosis following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Additionally, immunosuppression after kidney transplantation may increase viral replication and possibly exacerbate liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>As liver biopsy is an invasive procedure with possible severe complications and the potential for sampling error, alternative noninvasive tests for the assessment of the fibrosis stage have been developed and extensively evaluated in the general population with HCV infection. However, in the HCV-infected transplant candidates, due to the high relevance in decision making of a combined versus single organ transplantation, a liver biopsy before kidney transplantation remains the gold standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Though it was feared that the bleeding risk of liver biopsies is higher in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients due to impaired platelet function, percutaneous liver biopsy is recommended by KDIGO and appears not to impose an increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. To decrease the risk of postinterventional bleeding in patients with coagulation disorders and in patients on peritoneal dialysis, a transjugular instead of a percutaneous approach can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An additional benefit of a transjugular biopsy is that the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) can be measured in patients with suspected cirrhosis.</p><p>Patients with cirrhosis on biopsy may benefit from combined liver-kidney transplantation, although there is no consensus or standardized criteria to define when to perform a kidney transplantation alone versus combined liver-kidney transplantation. This decision usually depends on the degree to which cirrhosis is compensated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCV-infected patients with cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease should not receive a kidney transplant alone, but should be considered for combined liver-kidney transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrence of hepatitis C virus infection following liver transplantation&quot;, section on 'Combined liver-kidney transplantation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCV-infected patients with compensated liver cirrhosis (ie, those with well-preserved liver function without portal hypertension) should receive a kidney transplantation alone. When sustained virologic response (SVR) has been achieved after HCV treatment (which is very likely with contemporaneous direct-acting antiviral regimens), and no other co-morbidities are present, it is possible that liver function will remain stable over a long period of time.</p><p/><p>The American consensus conference on combined liver-kidney transplantation in 2008 proposed that combined liver-kidney transplantation should be performed if patients have severe portal hypertension, even with compensated cirrhosis, since hepatic venous-pressure gradient predicts clinical decompensation in patients with compensated cirrhosis and is directly related to mortality. Severe portal hypertension was defined as a HVPG of &ge;10 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portal-hypertension-in-adults#H64700612\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portal hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Prognostic implications of HVPG thresholds'</a>.) However, under the existing allocation policy using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, the HCV-infected ESRD patient who has compensated cirrhosis with portal hypertension but no bleeding diathesis will have a very low chance of receiving a liver, especially in countries with higher demand for MELD scores for liver transplant. Thus, the medical eligibility criteria for allocation of liver-kidney need to be revised to provide prioritization to such patients for combined liver-kidney transplantation.</p><p>Patients with less severe portal hypertension (ie, HVPG &lt;10 mmHg) may have acceptable outcomes with kidney transplantation alone. In two series with 9 and 18 patients, respectively, with biopsy-proven HCV cirrhosis with HPVG &lt;10 mmHg who underwent kidney transplantation alone, for the first three years, there was no significant difference in patient and graft survival rates as compared with recipients without cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, larger prospective studies are needed to determine whether HPVG may be used as a criterion to identify patients who are acceptable for kidney transplantation alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1762642761\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-HCV treatment evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of renal transplant candidates and recipients in expectation of HCV antiviral therapy is generally the same as for the general population.

In addition, fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, characterized by prominent cholestasis and rapidly progressive liver failure, has been described following renal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Some studies have suggested that HCV-related liver disease progresses more rapidly to cirrhosis among kidney transplant recipients compared with nontransplant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, this has not been supported by other studies, which suggested slower progression of liver injury after kidney transplantation compared with patients on the kidney transplant waiting list [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Differences in outcome among studies have been attributed to differences in the severity and duration of HCV infection and comorbidities at the time of transplantation and to different immunosuppressive regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Since only a limited number of antiviral options have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the pretransplant setting, the timing of antiviral treatment depends upon the patient's eligibility for one of these limited options and the safety of delaying treatment until posttransplant, when improved renal function is expected and more therapeutic options would thus be available. Delaying treatment may also open up the possibility of receipt of an HCV-positive organ, which could decrease waiting times. The safety of delaying treatment is informed by the expected waiting time until transplantation, the liver fibrosis stage and rate of progression, and the presence of extrahepatic HCV manifestations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In kidney transplant candidates who do <strong>not</strong> have advanced or rapidly progressive liver fibrosis, severe extrahepatic manifestations, or an anticipated prolonged wait on the deceased-donor waiting list, our approach is based upon the eligibility for regimens that can be used in the setting of renal impairment:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients who can take one of the regimens appropriate for renal impairment (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glecaprevir-and-pibrentasvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glecaprevir-pibrentasvir</a> for all genotypes and elbasvir-grazoprevir- or ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir-based regimens for genotypes 1 or 4 infection), treatment either prior to transplantation or after transplantation is a reasonable option.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The optimal choice between these might differ by country, depending on the availability of HCV-positive organs and the subsequent waiting time on the transplant list. Successfully treating HCV-infected candidates in the pretransplant period eliminates the option of receiving organs from HCV-infected donors and could therefore result in increased waiting times. In the United States, for example, the waiting time can be less than one year for an HCV-positive organ but more than five years for an HCV-negative organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. Thus, postponing HCV treatment in a patient with no significant hepatic fibrosis or extrahepatic manifestations so that the patient can receive an organ earlier may be a valuable option.

HCV-infected renal transplant recipients have worse patient and allograft survival after transplantation compared with noninfected renal transplant recipients. However, HCV-infected patients have a lower mortality following transplantation compared with mortality on dialysis. HCV infection is not considered a contraindication to transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H888895258\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In high-prevalence countries, transplant candidates should be screened for HCV infection by testing for HCV RNA rather than by assaying for anti-HCV antibody. HCV antibody may be used for screening in low-prevalence countries with the knowledge that antibody production may be absent in immunocompromised patients such as dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"#H10210201\" class=\"local\">'HCV evaluation of transplant candidates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCV-infected transplant candidates should undergo a liver biopsy prior to transplantation in order to exclude cirrhosis. The presence of cirrhosis (decompensated or with severe portal hypertension) on biopsy is associated with a very poor prognosis following transplantation and excludes transplantation of a kidney alone in most centers. These patients should be considered for combined kidney-liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H10210201\" class=\"local\">'HCV evaluation of transplant candidates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplant candidates with chronic HCV infection should undergo regular follow-up with a hepatologist. (See <a href=\"#H558732\" class=\"local\">'Timing of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCV infection is a major cause of liver disease and recurrent and de novo kidney disease following kidney transplantation. HCV infection is also associated with new-onset diabetes and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). (See <a href=\"#H432879189\" class=\"local\">'Complications after transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For renal transplant candidates, timing of antiviral treatment (before or after transplantation) depends on several factors, including severity of liver disease or extrahepatic manifestations, eligibility for antiviral regimens that have established safety in the setting of severe renal impairment, and estimated waiting time on the renal transplant list. In locations where receiving an HCV-positive organ reduces the waiting time substantially, deferring antiviral treatment until after transplantation to maintain eligibility for an HCV-positive organ is a reasonable strategy as long as disease severity does not warrant earlier treatment. (See <a href=\"#H558732\" class=\"local\">'Timing of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to antiviral treatment in HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients depends on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

HCV infection increases mortality and morbidity after renal transplantation, and the treatment of HCV infection is effective and safe in such patients.
