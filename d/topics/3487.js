It affects more than 5 percent of the population and is associated with high morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It is the third-ranked cause of death in the United States, killing more than 120,000 individuals each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As a consequence of its high prevalence and chronicity, COPD causes high resource utilization with frequent clinician office visits, frequent hospitalizations due to acute exacerbations, and the need for chronic therapy (eg, supplemental oxygen therapy, medication) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Establishing a correct diagnosis of COPD is important because appropriate management can decrease symptoms (especially dyspnea), reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, improve health status, improve exercise capacity, and prolong survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As current and former smokers are also at risk for a number of other medical problems for which treatment is very different, respiratory symptoms should not be attributed to COPD without appropriate evaluation and diagnosis. &#160;</p><p>The definition, clinical manifestations, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of COPD are discussed in this topic review.

Whether these features identify separate &quot;phenotypes&quot; of COPD or reflect disease severity remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, evaluation of these features can help guide clinical management, and their use in classification of patients is now recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

The chronic airflow limitation that characterizes COPD is caused by a mixture of small airways disease (eg, obstructive bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), the relative contributions of which vary from person to person. Chronic inflammation causes structural changes, small airways narrowing, and destruction of lung parenchyma. A loss of small airways may contribute to airflow limitation and mucociliary dysfunction, a characteristic feature of the disease.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263049277\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic bronchitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic bronchitis is defined as a chronic productive cough for three months in each of two successive years in a patient in whom other causes of chronic cough (eg, bronchiectasis) have been excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It may precede or follow development of airflow limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,11</a>]. This definition has been used in many studies, despite the arbitrarily selected symptom duration. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis may develop in cigarette smokers as early as 36 years of age and have been associated with a higher frequency of exacerbation events, even in the absence of airflow obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Current and former smokers have increased airway mucin concentration (MUC5AC and MUC5B), compared with never smokers; those with symptoms of chronic bronchitis also have higher concentrations than those of similar GOLD stage without symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263049416\"><span class=\"h2\">Emphysema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emphysema is a pathological term that describes some of the structural changes sometimes associated with COPD. These changes include abnormal and permanent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles that is accompanied by destruction of the airspace walls, without obvious fibrosis (ie, there is no fibrosis visible to the naked eye) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Exclusion of obvious fibrosis was intended to distinguish the alveolar destruction due to emphysema from that due to the interstitial pneumonias. However, many studies have found increased collagen in the lungs of patients with mild COPD, indicating that fibrosis can be a component of emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. While emphysema can exist in individuals who do not have airflow obstruction, it is more common among patients who have moderate or severe airflow obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17</a>].</p><p>The various subtypes of emphysema (eg, proximal acinar, panacinar, distal acinar) are described below. (See <a href=\"#H18807517\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263049549\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) gives the following definition of asthma: &quot;Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread, but variable, airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Interrelationships among asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early definitions of COPD distinguished different types (ie, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma), a distinction that is not included in the current definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. However, individual patients present with a spectrum of manifestations of COPD and related processes, so understanding the types of COPD, as illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66708\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66708 \">figure 1</a>), can be helpful diagnostically. Important points about their interrelationship include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asthma whose airflow obstruction is completely reversible are not considered to have COPD (subset nine in the figure).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asthma whose airflow obstruction does not remit completely are considered to have COPD (subsets six, seven, and eight in the figure). The etiology and pathogenesis of the COPD in such patients may be different from that of patients with chronic bronchitis or emphysema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic bronchitis and emphysema with airflow obstruction commonly occur together (subset five in the figure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Some of these patients may also have asthma (subset eight in the figure).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with asthma may develop a chronic productive cough, either spontaneously or due to exposure (eg, cigarette smoke, allergen). Such patients are often referred to as having asthmatic bronchitis, although this terminology has not been officially endorsed in clinical practice guidelines (subset six in the figure).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persons with chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both are not considered to have COPD unless they have airflow obstruction (subsets one, two, and eleven in the figure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with airflow obstruction due to diseases that have a known etiology or a specific pathology (eg, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, obliterative bronchiolitis) are not considered to have COPD (subset 10 in the figure). However, these exclusions are loosely defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1074708457\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma-COPD overlap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consistent with the idea that significant overlap exists among the different types of COPD, many individuals have bronchial inflammation with features of both asthma and chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">bronchitis/emphysema</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26-28</a>]. Similarly, the nature of the bronchial inflammation varies widely even among individuals with a single type of COPD. In recognition of this overlap, GOLD and GINA issued a consensus statement on Asthma, COPD, and Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS, also referred to as asthma-COPD overlap [ACO]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], which describes the overlap as &quot;characterized by persistent airflow limitation with several features usually associated with asthma and several features usually associated with COPD. ACOS is therefore identified in clinical practice by the features that it shares with both asthma and COPD.&quot; </p><p>Further study of this overlap will be needed to determine with certainty how treatment algorithms should be tailored to these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As an example, a subgroup of patients with sputum eosinophilia may experience lung function improvement with anti-interleukin-5 receptor monoclonal antibody that depletes blood and sputum eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] and further investigation into this medication class is ongoing. Similarly, an evolving literature suggests differential responses to inhaled glucocorticoids in patients with or without increased circulating eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18807517\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The predominant pathologic changes of COPD are found in the airways, but changes are also seen in the lung parenchyma and pulmonary vasculature. In an individual, the pattern of pathologic changes depends on the underlying disease (eg, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency), possibly individual susceptibility, and disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While radiographic methods do not have the resolution of histology, high resolution computed tomography can assess lung parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], and pulmonary vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airways</strong> &ndash; Airways abnormalities in COPD include chronic inflammation, increased numbers of goblet cells, mucus gland hyperplasia, fibrosis, narrowing and reduction in the number of small airways, and airway collapse due to the loss of tethering caused by alveolar wall destruction in emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among patients with chronic bronchitis who have mucus hypersecretion, an increased number of goblet cells and enlarged submucosal glands are typically seen. Chronic inflammation in chronic bronchitis and emphysema is characterized by the presence of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, and CD68+ <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69029\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69029 \">picture 1</a>) in the airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-40</a>]. In comparison, the bronchial inflammation of asthma is characterized by the presence of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, eosinophils, and increased interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/26,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,41,42</a>]. While these paradigms are helpful conceptually, they are not diagnostic and overlaps exist. For example, there may be a set of asthmatic patients who progress to develop COPD. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lung parenchyma</strong> &ndash; Emphysema affects the structures distal to the terminal bronchiole, consisting of the respiratory bronchiole, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli, known collectively as the acinus. These structures in combination with their associated capillaries and interstitium form the lung parenchyma. The part of the acinus that is affected by permanent dilation or destruction determines the subtype of emphysema. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Proximal acinar (also known as centrilobular) emphysema refers to abnormal dilation or destruction of the respiratory bronchiole, the central portion of the acinus. It is commonly associated with cigarette smoking, but can also be seen in coal workers&rsquo; pneumoconiosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Panacinar emphysema refers to enlargement or destruction of all parts of the acinus. Diffuse panacinar emphysema is most commonly associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, although it can be seen in combination with proximal emphysema in smokers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In distal acinar (also known as paraseptal) emphysema, the alveolar ducts are predominantly affected. Distal acinar emphysema may occur alone or in combination with proximal acinar and panacinar emphysema. When it occurs alone, the usual association is spontaneous pneumothorax in a young adult. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary vasculature</strong> &ndash; Changes in the pulmonary vasculature include intimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle <span class=\"nowrap\">hypertrophy/hyperplasia</span> thought to be due to chronic hypoxic vasoconstriction of the small pulmonary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Destruction of alveoli due to emphysema can lead to loss of the associated areas of the pulmonary capillary bed and pruning of the distal vasculature, which can be detected radiographically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20447432\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking and inhalational exposure history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is cigarette smoking. Other exposures including passive smoke and biomass fuel use also play roles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,44,45</a>]. </p><p>The amount and duration of smoking contribute to disease severity. Thus, a key step in the evaluation of patients with suspected COPD is to ascertain the number of pack years smoked (packs of cigarettes per day multiplied by the number of years), as the majority (about 80 percent) of patients with COPD in the United States have a history of cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. A smoking history should include the age of starting and the age of quitting, as patients may underestimate the number of years they smoked. With enough smoking, almost all smokers will develop measurably reduced lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. While studies have shown an overall &quot;dose-response curve&quot; for smoking and lung function, some individuals develop severe disease with fewer pack years and others have minimal to no symptoms despite many pack years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The exact threshold for the <span class=\"nowrap\">duration/intensity</span> of cigarette smoking that will result in COPD varies from one individual to another. In the absence of a <span class=\"nowrap\">genetic/environmental/occupational</span> predisposition, smoking less than 10 to 15 pack years of cigarettes is unlikely to result in COPD. On the other hand, the single best variable for predicting which adults will have airflow obstruction on spirometry is a history of more than 40 pack years of smoking (positive likelihood ratio [LR], 12 [95% CI, 2.7-50]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. </p><p>The chronologically taken <span class=\"nowrap\">environmental/occupational</span> history may disclose other important risk factors for COPD, such as exposure to fumes or organic or inorganic dusts. These exposures help to explain the 20 percent of patients with COPD (defined by lung function alone) and the 20 percent of patients who die from COPD who never smoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/47,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,50,51</a>]. A history of asthma should also be sought, as COPD is often misdiagnosed as asthma. In addition, asthma may progress to fixed airflow limitation and COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Less common symptoms include wheezing and chest tightness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53303 \">table 1A</a>). However, any of these symptoms may develop independently and with variable intensity.</p><p>There are three typical ways in which patients with COPD present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have an extremely sedentary lifestyle but few complaints require careful questioning to elicit a history that is suggestive of COPD. Some patients unknowingly avoid exertional dyspnea by shifting their expectations and limiting their activity. They may be unaware of the extent of their limitations or that their limitations are due to respiratory symptoms, although they may complain of fatigue. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who present with respiratory symptoms generally complain of dyspnea and chronic cough. The dyspnea may initially be noticed only during exertion. However, it eventually becomes noticeable with progressively less exertion or even at rest. The chronic cough is characterized by the insidious onset of sputum production, which occurs in the morning initially, but may progress to occur throughout the day. The daily volume rarely exceeds 60 mL. The sputum is usually mucoid, but becomes purulent during exacerbations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who present with episodes of increased cough, purulent sputum, wheezing, fatigue, and dyspnea that occur intermittently, with or without fever. Diagnosis can be problematic in such patients. The combination of wheezing plus dyspnea may lead to an incorrect diagnosis of asthma. Conversely, other illnesses with similar manifestations are often incorrectly diagnosed as a COPD exacerbation (eg, heart failure, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51974 \">table 2</a>). The interval between exacerbations decreases as the severity of the COPD increases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Approximately 62 percent of patients with moderate to severe COPD report variability in symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, sputum, wheezing, or chest tightness) over the course of the day or week-to-week; morning is typically the worst time of day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Patients with COPD may experience weight gain (due to activity limitations), weight loss (possibly due to dyspnea while eating), limitation of activity (including sexual), cough syncope, or feelings of depression or anxiety.

Typically, the finding of persistent airflow limitation on pulmonary function testing and the absence of radiographic features of heart failure or interstitial lung disease direct the clinician to a narrower differential of COPD, chronic obstructive asthma, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, constrictive bronchiolitis, and diffuse panbronchiolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Importantly, these conditions can commonly occur together, for example, patients with asthma may develop COPD and patients with COPD may have concurrent bronchiectasis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic obstructive asthma</strong> &ndash; In some patients with chronic asthma, a clear distinction from COPD is not possible. As an example, a patient, who has had atopic asthma since childhood and smoked cigarettes for 15 years in their twenties and thirties could present in their fifties with a combination of asthma and COPD. The importance of recognizing the coexistence of these diseases is in devising a treatment plan that is adapted to reflect both underlying disease processes.

They are not considered to have COPD, although they may develop COPD if they continue to smoke. Some treatments for COPD may improve their cough. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Interrelationships among asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central airway obstruction </strong>&ndash; Central airway obstruction can be caused by numerous benign and malignant processes and can mimic COPD with a slowly progressive dyspnea on exertion followed by dyspnea with minimal activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55320\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55320 \">table 5</a>). Monophonic wheezing or stridor may be present. Symptoms are minimally improved by inhaled bronchodilator, if at all. A high index of suspicion is needed as conventional chest radiographs are rarely diagnostic. Though insensitive, flow volume loops can show the characteristic changes of central airway obstruction, frequently before abnormalities in the spirometric volumes are noted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73686\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73686 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. A high resolution CT scan with three-dimensional reconstruction can be helpful. The gold standard for diagnosis is direct visualization.

Bronchiectasis is suspected on the basis of prominent symptoms of cough and daily mucopurulent sputum production. The diagnosis is usually established clinically based on the characteristic cough and sputum production and the presence of bronchial wall thickening and luminal dilatation on chest computed tomographic (CT) scans. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heart failure</strong> &ndash; Heart failure is a common cause of dyspnea among middle-aged and older patients and some patients experience chest tightness and wheezing with fluid overload due to heart failure. Occasionally, airflow limitation is noted, although a restrictive pattern is more common. Heart failure is usually differentiated by the presence of fine basilar crackles, radiographic evidence of an increased heart size and pulmonary edema. The brain natriuretic peptide is typically increased in heart failure, but can also be increased during right heart strain from cor pulmonale. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tuberculosis</strong> &ndash; In an area endemic for tuberculosis, the overall prevalence of airflow obstruction was 31 percent among those with a past history of tuberculosis compared with 14 percent among those without. This association was unchanged after adjustment for respiratory disease in childhood, smoking, and exposure to dust and smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>]. Thus, tuberculosis is both a risk factor for COPD and a potential comorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Constrictive bronchiolitis is most commonly seen following inhalation injury, transplantation (eg, bone marrow, lung), or in the context of rheumatoid lung or inflammatory bowel disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58035\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58035 \">table 6</a>). Symptoms include progressive onset of cough and dyspnea associated with hypoxemia at rest or with exercise. Crackles may be present. Pulmonary function tests show a progressive and irreversible airflow limitation. Findings on inspiratory CT scan include centrilobular bronchial wall thickening, bronchiolar dilation, tree-in-bud pattern, and a mosaic ground-glass attenuation pattern. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-adults#H48749157\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Bronchiolitis obliterans'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diffuse panbronchiolitis</strong> &ndash; Diffuse panbronchiolitis is predominantly seen in male nonsmokers of Asian descent. Almost all have chronic sinusitis. On pulmonary function testing, an obstructive defect is common, although a mixed obstructive-restrictive pattern may also be seen. Chest radiographs and high resolution CT scans show diffuse centrilobular nodular and linear opacities corresponding to thickened and dilated bronchiolar walls with intraluminal mucous plugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffuse-panbronchiolitis#H11949013\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffuse panbronchiolitis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphangioleiomyomatosis</strong> &ndash; Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is seen primarily in young women of childbearing age. Pulmonary function testing frequently reveals mild airflow obstruction, although a mixed obstructive-restrictive pattern may be seen. CT scans typically demonstrate small, thin-walled cysts that can at times be confused with emphysema. However, the airspaces in emphysema are not actually cysts but are caused by the destruction of alveolar walls and permanent enlargement of distal airspaces, so the &quot;walls&quot; are typically inapparent. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sporadic-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine screening spirometry is generally not indicated for adults who have none of the features suggestive of COPD (eg, no dyspnea, cough, sputum production or progressive decline in activity), as asymptomatic mild airflow obstruction does not require treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/48,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,98</a>]. Asymptomatic and nonsmoking subjects with mild airflow obstruction, but no history of asthma, do not have the same progressive decline in lung function that is observed among individuals who have a similar degree of airflow obstruction and are symptomatic or continue to smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. </p><p>On the other hand, waiting for patients to report symptoms may miss a large number of patients who have COPD, as 20 percent of individuals with severe airway obstruction due to smoking or asthma will not report symptoms. Decrements in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), even within the normal range, are associated with increased risk of acute cardiac events independent of age, gender, and smoking history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Thus, performance of spirometry seems reasonable whenever COPD is a diagnostic consideration. The diagnosis of COPD may alter management of concurrent conditions and may affect the approach to exercise. Exclusion of COPD can often contribute to clinical management as much as its diagnosis by leading to alternative diagnoses. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines used the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>; expressed as a percentage of predicted) to stage disease severity. However, the FEV<sub>1</sub> only captures one component of COPD severity: two patients with the same percent predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> can have a substantially different exercise tolerance and prognosis. Other aspects of disease, such as the severity of symptoms, risk of exacerbations, and the presence of comorbidities, are important to the patient's experience of the disease and prognosis and are included in newer staging systems, such as the revised GOLD classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,100</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Several tools for evaluating symptom severity have been proposed. The GOLD guidelines suggest using the COPD Assessment Tool (CAT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8,101-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,101-105</a>] or the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86426 \">table 7</a>), although the latter does not assess COPD-related symptoms other than breathlessness. The most widely used research tool, the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), is a 76 item questionnaire that includes three component scores (ie, symptoms, activity, and impact on daily life) and a total score. While valuable for research purposes in patients with COPD, asthma, and bronchiectasis, it is too long and complicated for use in routine clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/106-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">106-108</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2694576\"><span class=\"h2\">GOLD system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapeutic strategy of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, updated in 2017, suggests using an assessment of airflow limitation in parallel with a combined assessment of an individual's symptoms and exacerbation history to guide therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The severity of lung function impairment is stratified based on the postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>, using the GOLD classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82690 \">table 3</a>). GOLD continues to prefer using the ratio of 0.70 for FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/forced</span> vital capacity (FVC) as the threshold for determining the presence of airflow limitation. (See <a href=\"#H27742482\" class=\"local\">'Spirometry'</a> above.) </p><p>Symptom severity is assessed using the CAT or mMRC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86426 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Lung function in addition to the number of exacerbations and hospitalizations for exacerbations in the previous 12 months can be used to predict future risk. A history of zero or one exacerbation in the past 12 months and GOLD 1 or 2 spirometric level suggests a low future risk of exacerbations, while two or more exacerbations or a hospitalized exacerbation or GOLD 3 or 4 spirometric level suggest a high future risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These components are combined into four groups as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group A: Low risk, less symptoms: 0 to 1 exacerbation per year and no prior hospitalization for exacerbation; and CAT score &lt;10 or mMRC grade 0 to 1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group B: Low risk, more symptoms: 0 to 1 exacerbation per year and no prior hospitalization for exacerbation; and CAT score &ge;10 or mMRC grade &ge;2.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group C: High risk, less symptoms: &ge;2 exacerbations per year or &ge;1 hospitalization for exacerbation; and CAT score &lt;10 or mMRC grade 0 to 1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group D: High risk, more symptoms: &ge;2 exacerbations per year or &ge;1 hospitalization for exacerbation; and CAT score &ge;10 or mMRC grade &ge;2.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1869643789\"><span class=\"h2\">BODE index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The BODE index, which is another system for assessment of COPD severity and prognosis, is calculated based on weight (BMI), airway obstruction (FEV<sub>1</sub>), dyspnea (mMRC dyspnea score), and exercise capacity (six-minute walk distance) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-bode-index-for-copd-survival-prediction-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), has been used to assess an individual&rsquo;s risk of death.

The chronic airflow limitation that characterizes COPD is caused by a mixture of small airways disease (eg, obstructive bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), the relative contributions of which vary from person to person. Chronic inflammation causes structural changes, small airways narrowing and destruction of lung parenchyma. A loss of small airways may contribute to airflow limitation and mucociliary dysfunction, a characteristic feature of the disease.

Chest computed tomography is performed to evaluate abnormalities seen on the conventional chest radiograph, to exclude certain complications of COPD (eg, thromboembolic disease, lung cancer), or when a patient is being considered for lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplantation.

Although well-recognized and commonly used, it has been criticized for underestimating the importance of the extrapulmonary manifestations of COPD in predicting outcome. The revised GOLD strategy uses a combination of an individual's symptoms and history of exacerbations and hospitalizations due to exacerbations to assess exacerbation risk and guide therapy. Other multidimensional staging systems include the BODE index (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-bode-index-for-copd-survival-prediction-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) and the COPD Foundation system.
