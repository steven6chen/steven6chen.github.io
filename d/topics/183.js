The diagnosis of acquired cystic disease is established by ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scanning, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although each procedure can have false-negative results. CT- and MR-based imaging offer increased sensitivity in detecting small cysts over ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A diagnosis requires involvement of both kidneys, with four or more cysts being present. Acquired cystic disease can be easily distinguished from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) as the kidneys are small to normal in size, as opposed to the extremely large kidneys found in all ADPKD individuals with renal insufficiency.</p><p>Often, acquired cystic disease can be detected prior to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been reported in patients with creatinine clearances as high as 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. However, the majority of cases occur in patients with creatinine clearances &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The incidence of acquired cystic disease increases progressively with duration of dialysis. In one study of 130 patients with advanced renal disease or ESRD, the incidence of multiple cysts was noted to be 7 percent in those with chronic renal failure and 22 percent in those on maintenance dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. An additional 30 to 50 percent had one to three renal cysts, potentially representing an early form of the disease. The duration of dialysis was 15 months in patients with no cysts, 28 months in those with one to three cysts, and 49 months in those with acquired cystic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Fifty to 80 percent of patients are affected after &ge;10 years on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Men and African Americans have been reported to be at much higher risk than women or Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. However, additional studies have estimated a 31 percent prevalence of acquired cystic disease in black African dialysis patients, similar to reports in other ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>These observations suggest that the duration of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major risk factor for renal cyst development. In comparison, the etiology of the underlying renal disease does not appear to associate with the development of acquired cystic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of acquired cystic disease is incompletely understood. Nephron loss of any cause leads to compensatory hypertrophy in the remaining normal nephrons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>). The cysts are limited to the kidney (in comparison with polycystic kidney disease [PKD]), suggesting that local, intrarenal events are of primary importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The cyst fluid, which is thought to derive from ultrafiltrate secreted into the cyst, typically has a composition similar to that in the plasma; this finding plus the presence of a brush border on the luminal membrane suggests that the cysts arise primarily from proliferation of proximal tubular epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Compensatory renal hypertrophy is driven by activation of proto-oncogenes and release of growth factors (such as epidermal and hepatocyte growth factors), which, over a prolonged period of time, can lead to tubular hyperplasia and cyst formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In addition, one of these proto-oncogenes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in acquired cystic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The cysts may stabilize or regress following successful renal transplantation, a setting in which the level of growth factors is reduced due to the restoration of normal renal function. As a result, the outcome of acquired cystic disease is generally better than in patients maintained on chronic dialysis. In one prospective study, the incidence of cystic disease was lower, and the native kidneys were smaller and had lower cyst grades in transplant recipients when compared with patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This benefit was limited to patients not receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. Those treated with cyclosporine had an incidence of cystic disease similar to the dialyzed patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with acquired cystic disease are asymptomatic. In one review, for example, only 14 percent of patients developed symptoms, with hematuria being most common, followed by lumbar pain and urinary tract infection (UTI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, even in asymptomatic patients, longitudinal radiologic studies demonstrate a progressive increase in the number and size of cysts, which can associate with both bleeding and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Rupture of a cystic blood vessel occurs in up to 50 percent of cases at some time. Although most episodes are asymptomatic, local pain and gross hematuria can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Less often, the hemorrhage may extend into the perirenal area and be severe enough to induce hypotension or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/2,7,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,15-17</a>]. This complication is most likely to occur in patients with very large cysts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal cell carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence in RCC as a complication of acquired cystic disease varies in different reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/7,13,14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,14,18</a>]. Two prospective studies found an incidence of 4 percent (2 of 57) and 7 percent (2 of 30) over a 7- to 10-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>]. A review of published reports estimated an incidence of 0.18 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Most reports, however, may misrepresent the true incidence of RCC because they primarily rely upon screening radiography, particularly ultrasonography, for detection. Perhaps a better estimate was provided by a single-center study in which most renal transplant patients underwent ipsilateral native nephrectomy at the time of transplant surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Based upon strict pathologic criteria, RCC was found in 4.2 percent of 260 nephrectomies, which may be lower than the true incidence given that only one kidney was removed.</p><p>The carcinomas are usually limited to the kidney and, in approximately 25 to 50 percent of cases, are multiple and bilateral, a finding that is consistent with the diffuse nature of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/1,2,13,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,13,20,21</a>]. Importantly, the bilateral presentation may not influence prognosis. Malignancy generally develops after at least 8 to 10 years of dialysis, although a shorter interval can be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Men (male-to-female ratio 7:1) and patients with large cysts and an increased kidney size are at increased risk for malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/13,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23</a>]. Malignancy associated with acquired cystic disease also can occur after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Renal transplant patients with acquired cystic disease should be closely followed for this complication. Recommendations for the surveillance of such patients are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Development of malignancy following solid organ transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been suggested, however, that acquired cystic disease and RCC are two disorders that represent separate diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The overall incidence of RCC and distant metastases in all patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is approximately 1 to 2.6 percent and 0.2 to 0.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24</a>]. Two large, prospective studies showed similar prevalence rates in Japan (1.7 percent) and the United States (1.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/18,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25</a>]. Although these values are more than 30 times higher than in the general population, they are not much higher than those reported in autopsy studies in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Furthermore, some patients with cancer do not have cystic disease, and some develop the malignancy prior to the institution of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/20,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26</a>].</p><p>One study assessed the genetic abnormalities in RCCs occurring in patients with ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These patients did not have the changes that are frequently seen in patients with sporadic RCC: inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 3 or a mutation in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene. Somatic mutations in von Hippel-Lindau have been found in 1.3 percent of RCCs in hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, another study of 79 tumor samples from 69 ESRD patients with RCC showed no genomic profile differences between the sporadic versus ESRD cases of clear-cell and papillary RCC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acquired cystic kidney disease presents differently in kidney transplant recipients compared with the general population. A review of 1000 transplant recipients followed for 28 years showed that acquired cystic kidney disease is less common among transplant recipients compared with ESRD patients as a whole (23 versus 80 percent, respectively). The prevalence of RCC is higher among transplant recipients with acquired cystic kidney disease compared with those without (19 versus 0.5 percent), and 26 percent of those patients may have bilateral RCCs, indicating the need for a higher level of scrutiny [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an attempt at early detection of premalignant or malignant lesions, it has been suggested that yearly screening for acquired cystic disease be performed in patients who have been on dialysis for three to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/1,2,23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,23,26</a>]. Screening for acquired cystic disease and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is controversial. Screening in dialysis patients with very limited life expectancies (due to comorbidities or advanced age) is not recommended. However, we screen patients who have been on dialysis for three or more years who do not have a shortened life expectancy.</p><p>The optimal imaging modality for screening is uncertain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scanning is more sensitive than ultrasonography in detecting and characterizing cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/3,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,30</a>] but may not be superior in detecting solid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/4,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,30</a>].</p><p>However, different CT scanning modalities may be associated with enhanced accuracy. In one study of 630 chronic hemodialysis patients screened for RCC, early contrast-enhanced helical CT scanning was 96 percent sensitive and 95 percent specific for the detection of malignancy (as identified at surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. By comparison, the sensitivity and specificity of delayed-contrast imaging were only 83 and 94 percent, respectively.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with injection of gadolinium is the best modality to explore complex renal cysts, but, due to concerns over development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with CKD stages 4 and 5 and in patients on dialysis, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has maintained a boxed warning on all gadolinium chelates available on the United States market. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;, section on 'Avoidance of gadolinium'</a>.)</p><p>Noncontrast MRI may be superior to ultrasound in kidney transplant patients with acquired cystic kidney disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F99888\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99888 \">image 1</a>). In a pilot study of 215 kidney transplant recipients, 30 patients with acquired cystic kidney disease in the native kidneys (total of 54 kidneys) underwent noncontrast MRI (with diffusion-weighted sequences) and ultrasonography to screen for RCCs. Three kidneys (6 percent) had RCCs, of which one was diagnosed by both methods and two were only diagnosed by MRI. There were also four suspicious lesions that were categorized as complex proteinaceous or hemorrhagic cysts on MRI and that stayed stable over a median follow-up period of 400 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Finally, preliminary studies on contrast-enhanced ultrasonography using microbubbles show promising results to detect renal malignancies in patients with acquired cystic kidney disease. In a single-center study, 42 patients with acquired cystic kidney disease (of whom 15 had suspicious lesions for malignancy) underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound, which revealed four highly suspicious lesions that were surgically resected and confirmed as RCCs (three cases) or papillary carcinoma (one case). However, the lack of widespread availability of this technology is a limiting factor for its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>We generally begin screening with ultrasonography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F99887\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99887 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>Those individuals who screen negative for acquired cystic disease should be rescreened either when symptomatic or after a period of three to five years. The role of non-contrast MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in screening of RCCs remains to be better clarified in larger studies.</p><p>Once the ultrasonogram demonstrates cysts, the more sensitive contrast-enhanced CT scan or MRI without gadolinium may be performed at yearly intervals (particularly in patients with good life expectancies and very large cysts) to screen for the possible development of carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/4,14,26,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14,26,34,35</a>]. An avascular hemorrhagic cyst can usually be distinguished from a malignant lesion by its lack of contrast enhancement and its resolution over time on sequential studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. The surveillance of renal transplant patients with acquired cystic disease of the native kidney is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-care-of-the-adult-kidney-transplant-recipient#H2979947579\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of care of the adult kidney transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Malignancy'</a>.)</p><p>For all patients who have Bosniak class III and IV cysts, urology consultation should be obtained to discuss the surgical options of nephron-sparing (partial) or total nephrectomy.</p><p>However, these screening recommendations are not uniformly accepted. Given the low rate of death from metastatic RCC in dialysis patients, some investigators have suggested radiologic studies be performed only for symptoms such as new hematuria or flank pain or in young patients with risk factors such as long duration of dialysis and large kidneys due to acquired cystic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/24,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,36</a>].</p><p>A decision analysis has been performed that more precisely determines the benefit of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Assuming an incidence of malignancy of 0.9 percent per year, it was estimated that screening could result in a 1.6-year gain in life expectancy over a 25-year period. However, only young patients with a long lifespan would achieve this benefit. The benefit is likely to be negligible in the more common, older patients with significant comorbid diseases.</p><p>These considerations resulted in the American Society of Nephrology&rsquo;s &quot;Choosing wisely campaign&quot; recommendation to &quot;NOT perform routine cancer screening for dialysis patients with limited life expectancies without signs or symptoms.&quot; However, in some other populations, such as Japan, a strategy based on screening may be more appropriate given the increased mean survival of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management and prognosis of renal carcinoma is presented in detail separately.
