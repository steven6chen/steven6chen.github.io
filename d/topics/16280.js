Spinal anesthesia is most commonly used for anesthesia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> analgesia for a variety of lower extremity, lower abdominal, pelvic, and perineal procedures.</p><p>This topic will discuss the relevant anatomy, techniques, and management of spinal anesthesia.

Anatomy of the bony spine and vertebrae are discussed in more detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58088\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58088 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64902\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64902 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p>Anatomy related specifically to the performance of spinal anesthesia is discussed here.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vertebral level</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Spinal anesthesia is performed no higher than the mid to low lumbar vertebral level to avoid puncturing the spinal cord with the spinal needle. In most patients, the spinal cord terminates as the conus medullaris at the lower border of the first lumbar vertebral body (L1), though it may end lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, the spinal needle is inserted at the L3 to L4 or L4 to L5 interspace.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The intercristal line (ie, the line between the posterior superior iliac crests) is used as a rough guide for spinal needle placement. In many patients, this line crosses the body of L4, though it may cross the spine from L1 to L2 to L4 to L5, and tends to be higher in obese and female patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Because landmarks do not accurately predict the lumbar interspace, the spinal needle should be inserted at or below the intercristal line.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ligaments</strong> &ndash; The epidural space is the space between the dural sac and the inside of the bony spinal canal. The tough ligamentum flavum forms the posterior border of the epidural space at each interlaminar space. The interspinous ligament stretches between the spinous processes of successive vertebrae, and the supraspinous ligament anchors the tips of the spinous processes in a continuous column (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106236\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106236 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Meninges</strong> &ndash; Within the bony vertebral canal, the spinal cord is surrounded by three membranes: the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and the dura mater (innermost to outmost). The dura and arachnoid maters loosely adhere to each other in the spinal canal and comprise the &quot;dural sac&quot; in which the spinal cord is suspended. The subarachnoid space within the dural sac is located between the pia and arachnoid maters and contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), spinal nerves, and blood vessels. A loose trabecular network exists between the pia and dura-arachnoid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CSF</strong> &ndash; The central nervous system (CNS) is surrounded by CSF, an ultrafiltrate of blood. CSF is formed continuously by the choroid plexuses and serves to protect the brain and spinal cord by providing a cushion. It also serves as a conduit for the delivery of spinal anesthetic agents to the spinal cord. CSF circulates in the spinal canal, with both bulk flow and oscillatory movements. This flow may explain some of the movement of anesthetic agents toward the brain after injection into the lumbar subarachnoid space. The density of CSF at body temperature averages 1.0003&plusmn;0.0003 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/mL;</span> density relative to the injected local anesthetic (LA) solution affects the distribution of spinal block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H520191551\" class=\"local\">'Baricity'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nerves</strong> &ndash; The dorsal and ventral spinal nerve roots emerge from the spinal cord at each vertebral level and combine to form the spinal nerves. The lumbar and sacral nerve roots extend past the conus medullaris as the cauda equina and exit the vertebral canal between successive lumbar and sacral vertebrae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50257\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50257 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Autonomic nerves, both sympathetic and parasympathetic, are blocked by spinal anesthesia, in addition to sensory and motor nerves. The extent of sympathetic block depends on the height of the spinal block. Preganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers arise from the intermediolateral tract of the spinal cord from T1 to L2. The axons exit the spinal cord with the ventral nerve root of the spinal nerves and synapse with cell bodies in the ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. Sympathetic cardioaccelerator fibers arise from T1 to T4.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The splanchnic component of the parasympathetic nervous system travels in the ventral roots of S2 to S4 and supplies the organs of the pelvis, including the bladder, reproductive organs, descending colon, and rectum. Thus, all of the sacral parasympathetic nerves are blocked with spinal anesthesia, and some of the sympathetic nerves are blocked, depending on the cephalad extent of neural block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dermatomes</strong> &ndash; A dermatome is defined as the cutaneous area supplied by a single spinal nerve root (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106237 \">figure 5</a>). The term &quot;spinal level&quot; refers to the most cephalad dermatome anesthetized by the spinal anesthetic. The level required for a specific surgery is determined by the dermatome level of the skin incision and by the level required for surgical manipulation; these two requirements may be very different. As an example, a low abdominal incision for cesarean delivery is made at the T11 to T12 dermatome, but a T4 spinal level is required to prevent pain with peritoneal manipulation. The sensory and visceral spinal levels required for common surgical procedures are shown in tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106305%7EANEST%2F106817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106305 graphicRef106817 \">table 1A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Surface landmarks that correspond to dermatome levels include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Inguinal ligament</strong> &ndash; T12</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Umbilicus</strong> &ndash; T10</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Tip of xiphoid process</strong> &ndash; T7</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Nipple</strong> &ndash; T4</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Fifth finger</strong> &ndash; C8</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520190371\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A medical history and anesthesia-directed physical examination should be performed for all patients who undergo any type of anesthesia; when spinal anesthesia is planned, the lower back should be examined.</p><p>When considering spinal anesthesia, we focus the preoperative evaluation on those medical conditions that may alter the physiologic response to spinal anesthesia or increase the risk of complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520190437\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520190474\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation for spinal anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For spinal anesthesia, the standard and emergency anesthesia equipment and medications should be prepared as they would be for general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction#H254392428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;, section on 'Preparation for anesthetic induction'</a>.)</p><p>Most commonly, a disposable spinal kit is used, which contains needles, drugs, labels, and other required equipment. The kit is usually placed on a cart or table on the side of the clinician's dominant hand.</p><p>We prepare a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> infusion and a syringe of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> preoperatively; a high percentage of patients require administration of a vasoconstrictor during spinal anesthesia. Anticholinergic medication (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a>) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> should be immediately available.</p><p>Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors should be applied (ie, blood pressure, electrocardiography, oxygen saturation) prior to initiation of spinal anesthesia. Other monitoring (eg, intraarterial pressure monitoring) and the extent of venous access are dictated by the patient's medical status and the planned procedure.</p><p>A preprocedure time-out should be performed, which includes confirmation of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient identifiers (ie, name, medical record number, date of birth)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Planned surgical procedure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical and anesthesia consent with site marked, if applicable</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulation status (ie, anticoagulant administration, coagulation laboratory values if applicable)</p><p/><p>With the exception of discussion of the patient's coagulation status, these checklist components are a part of the World Health Organization (WHO) Surgical Safety Checklist components performed before the induction of anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520190492\"><span class=\"h2\">Premedication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Light sedation may be administered if necessary prior to spinal needle placement. Deep sedation should be avoided in order to allow patient cooperation with positioning and feedback (eg, the occurrence of pain or paresthesia) during the procedure. Any sedation should be administered in reduced doses, titrated to effect, anticipating the sedation that accompanies spinal block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia#H2863919650\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neuraxial anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Central nervous system'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520190587\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning for spinal procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal patient positioning is critical to the success of neuraxial procedures. In this setting, the goals of positioning are to avoid rotation of the spine and to create a straight path for needle insertion between the bones of the spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106238\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106238 \">figure 6</a>). Flexion of the spine opens the space between the spinous processes and is most important when a midline approach is used. (See <a href=\"#H520190955\" class=\"local\">'Approaches'</a> below.)</p><p>The sitting and lateral decubitus positions are used most commonly and are chosen according to clinician preference, planned patient position during the surgical procedure, patient body habitus, and patient comfort (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106234\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106234 \">figure 7</a>). As an example, the lateral position may be used for a patient with a hip fracture, with the fracture side up. The jackknife position (ie, prone with hips flexed) is occasionally used for spinal anesthesia placement when this will be the position for surgery (eg, for rectal procedures).</p><p>The clinician can stand or sit to perform the procedure; the table height and patient position should be adjusted to prevent the need for the clinician to bend or reach.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sitting position</strong> &ndash; The sitting position is most common and may be particularly useful for larger patients in whom the bony landmarks are difficult to feel; if the patient sits straight and level, the midline may be easier to estimate compared with the lateral position. The sitting position is usually preferred for very low sacral spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric local anesthetic (LA) drugs (ie, saddle block). (See <a href=\"#H520191551\" class=\"local\">'Baricity'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the sitting position, the patient's legs should hang off the side of the bed, with the feet planted on a nonmobile stool. The backs of the knees should be against the edge of the bed so that the patient's back is as close as possible to the clinician standing on the other side of the bed. The patient is asked to &quot;slouch&quot; symmetrically with shoulders over the hips to allow flexion of the lumbar spine. We usually have the patient sit with the arms bent at the elbows with forearms and hands resting lightly on the thighs. Alternatively, the patient can rest the arms on a padded Mayo stand; the patient should not lean forward, which would increase the lumbar lordosis. In addition, positioning aids are available that are designed to support the patient in the sitting position during neuraxial block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106230\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106230 \">figure 8</a>).</p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lateral decubitus position</strong> &ndash; Either left or right lateral decubitus position can be used and may be chosen based on the baricity of the spinal drug preparation. As an example, if hyperbaric medication is used for a left leg procedure, the patient should be positioned with the left side down. If baricity relative to surgical position is not a concern, the left lateral position is usually more comfortable for a right-handed clinician. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The patient's back should be close to the edge of the table nearest the clinician, parallel to the edge of the bed and vertical, with the hips aligned one above the other. The thighs are drawn up with the hips maximally flexed, and the patient is asked to &quot;push out&quot; or &quot;round&quot; the lower back. Patients instructed to &quot;curl up&quot; often actually curl their upper back, and since the bottom shoulder is fixed to the mattress, this results in rotation of the spine. The dependent shoulder may need to be pulled forward by an assistant. Patients with broad hips may require a pillow under and between the legs in order to prevent forward tilting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prone position</strong> &ndash; This position is occasionally used for spinal anesthesia for rectal or pilonidal surgery. The patient is positioned on chest supports, with the hips flexed (ie, the jackknife position). In this setting, hypobaric or isobaric spinal medication is used to primarily anesthetize low lumbar and sacral nerve roots. (See <a href=\"#H520191551\" class=\"local\">'Baricity'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520190675\"><span class=\"h2\">Preprocedure ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The utility of ultrasound to help define anatomy prior to spinal anesthesia is controversial. Ultrasound can be used to identify the interspace for needle placement, and to estimate the depth of the subarachnoid space, particularly in obese patients or those with difficult anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. However, neuraxial ultrasound requires training, takes extra time and equipment, and unlike ultrasound for peripheral nerve blocks, it cannot be easily performed in real time, as the procedure is performed.</p><p>We do not routinely use preprocedure ultrasound for spinal anesthesia, though it may be helpful for clinicians experienced with its use for patients with difficult anatomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520190735\"><span class=\"h2\">Aseptic technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strict aseptic technique is required for all aspects of the spinal anesthesia procedure. In 2017, the ASA published a Practice Advisory for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Management of Infectious Complications Associated with Neuraxial Techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. We agree with the critical components of the Practice Advisory, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician should:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wear a cap and mask, covering mouth and nose.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Remove jewelry, including rings and watches.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wash hands prior to the procedure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wear sterile gloves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin of the patient's back should be:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Widely cleaned using individual antiseptic packets of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>, preferably with alcohol, allowing adequate time for the solution to dry, according to the antiseptic package insert. The skin prep solution should be discarded before opening the spinal tray and preparing the drug solutions. Contamination of equipment with the prep solution must be avoided to prevent introduction of neurotoxic solution into the subarachnoid space.

Larger-diameter needles and cutting needle tips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>] are both associated with an increased risk of postdural puncture headache (PDPH) compared with smaller-diameter and pencil-point needles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia#H2261670\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neuraxial anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Postdural puncture headache'</a>.)</p><p>Disposable needles are used for spinal anesthesia. All spinal needles have a close-fitting, removable stylet that prevents skin and subcutaneous tissue from plugging the needle during insertion. Spinal needles are available in various gauges (ie, needle diameter) and with several needle tip shapes, as well as various lengths for use in larger patients. The commonly used needles and available sizes are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106306\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106306 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Spinal needles can be classified according to the needle tip, as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106239\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106239 \">figure 9</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cutting-tip needles</strong> &ndash; Quincke spinal needles have sharp cutting tips, with the hole at the end of the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pencil-point needles</strong> &ndash; Whitacre and Sprotte needles have a closed tip shaped like that of a pencil, with the hole on the side of the needle near the tip. These needles are designed to minimize leak of cerebrospinal fluid after puncture and reduce the chance of PDPH.</p><p/><p>An introducer needle is usually used to place the higher-gauge (ie, smaller-diameter, 24- to 27-gauge) spinal needles. These fine needles are very flexible and more difficult to direct through tissue than lower-gauge (greater-diameter) needles. The introducer needle is used to puncture the skin and is inserted into the interspinous ligament, when a midline approach is used, along the desired needle path. The spinal needle is then inserted through it.</p><p>A stiffer, larger-diameter spinal needle (ie, 22-gauge) may be required for older patients, in whom spinal needle placement may be more challenging. These patients are often unable to flex the lumbar spine and may have calcified ligaments that make the use of fine needles difficult or impossible. In addition, older patients are at lower risk for PDPH than younger patients regardless of spinal needle size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this setting, we try a 24- or 25-gauge pencil-point needle and use a 22-gauge needle if necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520190955\"><span class=\"h2\">Approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spinal needle can be inserted using a midline or a paramedian approach. The midline approach is simpler; the paramedian approach requires mental triangulation and an estimate of the depth from the skin to the dura. However, the midline approach may be unsuccessful in patients who are unable to flex the spine to open the space between adjacent spinous processes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106238\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106238 \">figure 6</a>). Paramedian needle placement requires less spinal flexion.</p><p>For either approach, the needle is usually inserted at the L4 to L5 or L3 to L4 interspace. In most patients, a line between the iliac crests crosses the body of L4 or the L4 to L5 interspace. (See <a href=\"#H520190259\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520190973\"><span class=\"h3\">Midline approach technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aim is to place the spinal needle precisely in the midline, which is usually defined by the spinous processes with optimal positioning. The procedure is performed as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpate the interspace between two spinous processes at the chosen spinal level. With a 25-gauge needle, raise a skin wheal with 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, in the midline of the spine, in the lower third of the interspace. Infiltrate the subcutaneous tissue with lidocaine into the interspinous ligament.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert an introducer needle at a slight cephalad angle, through the supraspinous ligament, until slightly firm tissue is felt, suggesting that the tip is in the interspinous ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106236\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106236 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the 24- to 27-gauge spinal needle into and through the introducer needle. The needle passes through the ligamentum flavum, followed by the epidural space, and then the dura-arachnoid. Changes in resistance are felt as the needle passes through each of these layers. A pop is often felt when the dura is pierced.

The epidural needle is advanced as described for spinal anesthesia. After the needle tip has punctured the dura, the epidural needle stylet is removed and the epidural catheter is inserted through the needle and advanced 2 to 4 cm into the subarachnoid space. The epidural needle is carefully withdrawn without moving the catheter, the epidural catheter connector is secured to the catheter, and CSF is allowed to backflow through the catheter to the hub of the epidural catheter connector (this is important so that the air in the dead space of the catheter is not injected into the subarachnoid space). The dead space of an epidural catheter is approximately 0.3 mL, and this volume must be taken into account when injecting the spinal anesthetic solution. Drugs used for continuous spinal anesthesia mimic those used for single-shot spinal anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H520191544\" class=\"local\">'Choice of spinal drugs'</a> below.)</p><p>Advantages of the continuous spinal technique include the option to titrate the initial dose, and the maintenance of anesthesia for a prolonged period. We usually decrease the initial dose to one-half to two-thirds of the usual single-shot dose and then titrate to effect. Additional doses of anesthetic solution can be injected as needed to prolong the block.</p><p>The use of continuous spinal anesthesia has fallen out of favor because of reports of neurologic complications, including cauda equina syndrome when LA was administered through small-gauge catheters (28-gauge, so-called microcatheters) for continuous spinal anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and because of the high risk of PDPH using larger-gauge catheters. A large retrospective study of continuous spinal anesthesia reported a 33.1 percent incidence of PDPH in obstetric patients who received continuous spinal with a microcatheter (28-gauge) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>A continuous spinal catheter is now commercially available in the United States, though experience with its use is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520191544\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of spinal drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For single-shot spinal anesthesia, LAs and adjuvant medications must be chosen to achieve the required spinal level and duration of anesthesia. The most important determinants of the extent of sensory block are the dose and baricity (relative to the patient's position) of the anesthetic solution. Less important variables include patient age, body mass index, orientation of the pencil-point spinal needle orifice, and the angle of the needle relative to the neuraxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520191551\"><span class=\"h3\">Baricity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Baricity refers to the ratio of the density of a solution to the density of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Solutions with the same density as CSF have a baricity of 1 and are called isobaric. Solutions more dense than CSF are called hyperbaric; those less dense than CSF are called hypobaric. The baricity of local anesthetic (LA) solutions used clinically are shown in a table(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108422 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Baricity influences the distribution of anesthetic solution within the subarachnoid space; hyperbaric solutions tend to &quot;sink&quot; within the CSF relative to the site of injection, and hypobaric solutions rise relative to the site of injection, while gravity has no effect on the distribution of isobaric solutions in CSF. Thus, the patient's position during and after injection of spinal drugs influences the extent of spinal block with hyperbaric or hypobaric drugs.</p><p>The baricity of the anesthetic solution, along with the patient's position, can be used to increase the density and duration of spinal block at the site of surgery. As an example, a saddle block (ie, low lumbar and sacral nerve block) can be achieved by injecting a hyperbaric solution in the sitting position and keeping the patient sitting for several minutes. Conversely, spinal anesthesia for rectal surgery can be performed with a hypobaric solution injected with the patient in a jackknife position.</p><p>Hyperbaric solutions are usually mixed by adding dextrose to LA (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> 0.75% in 8.25% dextrose, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracaine</a> 0.5% in 5% dextrose). A hypobaric solution can be mixed by adding tetracaine crystals to sterile water (eg, 0.2%). LA solutions in saline are slightly hypobaric but behave and are used clinically as if they are isobaric.</p><p>In general, hyperbaric solutions result in faster onset, greater extent of sensory block, and shorter duration of block compared with isobaric solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A double-blinded study of duration and extent of spinal anesthesia that randomized patients to receive hyperbaric drug (0.5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> with 5 or 8% glucose) or minimally hypobaric drug (plain 0.5% bupivacaine) found that the hyperbaric solutions produced greater cephalad spread of block compared with the hypobaric drug (ie, T6 versus T10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In our practice, we use hyperbaric solutions when the desired sensory level is higher than T10 (eg, cesarean delivery or postpartum tubal ligation), and we use isobaric (plain) solutions when a T10 sensory level is sufficient (eg, total knee or hip arthroplasties).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520191585\"><span class=\"h3\">Local anesthetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bupivacaine</a> is the most commonly used LA for spinal anesthesia in the United States.

We usually begin testing approximately three to five minutes after the intrathecal injection. We begin with testing to cold stimulus followed by pinprick or touch after an adequate sensory level to cold is documented.</p><p>Surface landmarks useful for estimating dermatome levels include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inguinal ligament</strong> &ndash; T12</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Umbilicus</strong> &ndash; T10</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tip of xiphoid process</strong> &ndash; T7</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nipple</strong> &ndash; T4</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fifth finger</strong> &ndash; C8</p><p/><p>Various methods are used to assess the level of sensory block prior to skin incision, including loss of sensation to a cold stimulus (eg, ice or alcohol swab), pinprick, or touch. The stimulus is applied at a level below the expected level of the block, where the patient is unlikely to feel the stimulus, and then reapplied sequentially higher along the flank until normal sensation returns.</p><p>The level at which sensation is lost depends on the stimulus, with loss of cold sensation at a higher level than pinprick, and loss of touch sensation lower still [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. One study of patients who underwent cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia compared cold, pinprick, and touch for assessment of the sensory level. The median sensory level to cold was approximately two dermatomes cephalad to the sensory level to pinprick, which in turn was approximately two dermatomes cephalad to the sensory level to touch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In a separate study, the level at which the patient first felt any touch was two dermatomes more caudad than the level at which touch felt normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-anesthesia-technique/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Thus, ascertaining &quot;first touch&quot; (eg, using a dull plastic needle cap or the rounded tip of a tongue depressor) is the most reliable way to determine that the sensory level is adequate for surgical anesthesia.</p><p>If the extent of sensory block is inadequate after approximately five minutes and hypobaric or hyperbaric solution was injected, the patient's position may be manipulated to augment intrathecal spread of the LA solution. As an example, if hyperbaric solution was used and the patient has a T6 sensory level, but a T4 level is desired, the patient may be placed in Trendelenburg position until the desired level is obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520191907\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation during spinal anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We administer sedation as needed, in small doses titrated to effect, anticipating the sedation that may occur as a direct effect of spinal anesthesia.
