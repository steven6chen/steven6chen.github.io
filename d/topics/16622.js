In addition, cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable defibrillators are also recommended for selected patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Options for surgical management of patients with end-stage, refractory systolic HF are more limited. Heart transplantation remains the ultimate treatment for end-stage HF, but the persistent shortage of donor hearts, contraindications due to recipient comorbidities, and transplant complications limit the utility of this approach. Thus, heart transplantation is not an option for most patients with end-stage HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and contraindications for cardiac transplantation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis after cardiac transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other surgical approaches to end-stage HF continue to evolve. Although large randomized trials are unusual in this field, important steps have been made over the past 10 to 15 years, as discussed below. However, the use of any of these approaches remains highly individualized. Current strategies include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary revascularization in selected patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and hibernating myocardium.

The use of these devices is discussed elsewhere.

Myocardial segments involved in myocardial infarction (MI) may subsequently recover, either spontaneously or after revascularization, and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) may improve markedly (and even normalize) in subsets of patients following successful revascularization. The recoverable or viable myocardium has been termed &quot;hibernating&quot; myocardium when the ischemia is chronic and &quot;stunned&quot; myocardium when the insult is transient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical syndromes of stunned or hibernating myocardium&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The methods used to diagnose ischemic cardiomyopathy and to detect hibernating myocardium, and the data supporting improvement in outcomes with revascularization (coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention) are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hibernating myocardium&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC SECONDARY MITRAL REGURGITATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some degree of mitral regurgitation is almost always present in patients with severe systolic dysfunction, regardless of etiology. In this setting, mitral incompetence is a consequence of mitral annular dilation, electromechanical dyssynchrony, and changes in the subvalvular geometry. Although it is usually functional in nature, the regurgitant flow imposes a hemodynamic load on the left ventricle (LV), leading to eccentric hypertrophy and dilatation that increases the degree of mitral regurgitation in a vicious cycle. </p><p>Management of chronic secondary mitral regurgitation includes medical therapy for heart failure (HF), cardiac resynchronization therapy in selected patients, and possibly mitral valve surgery or heart transplantation as discussed in detail separately. &#160;</p><p>Some investigators advocate combined mitral valve repair and LV reconstruction (see <a href=\"#H2855073\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical inhibition of dilation'</a> below) in patients with HF and significant mitral regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. This approach reverses LV dilatation although limited data are available on clinical outcomes compared to other therapies, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the mitral valve surgery arm of the Acorn trial, 193 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV HF (94 percent nonischemic) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>), LVEF &le;45 percent, and at least moderate to severe mitral regurgitation were randomly assigned to mitral valve surgery (repair or replacement) alone (n = 102) or mitral valve surgery plus implantation of the CorCap device (n = 91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Mortality was 1.6 percent at 30 days and 30 percent at five years. LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes declined during five-year follow-up and there was a borderline significant greater decline in end-diastolic volume with the addition of the CorCap device. During five-year follow-up, 29 patients had recurrent mitral regurgitation with four undergoing repeat mitral valve surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A series of 92 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF &le;35 percent and NYHA class III to IV HF underwent LV reconstruction with 55 patients undergoing concomitant mitral annuloplasty for moderate or greater mitral regurgitation detected prior to or immediately following ventricular reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Early mortality was 12.7 percent in patients undergoing annuloplasty and 5.4 percent in those not undergoing annuloplasty. The patients undergoing annuloplasty had significant larger preoperative LV volumes. Both groups had significantly improved LVEF and reduced LV volumes at one- and two-year follow-up. Recurrent mitral regurgitation was observed in one patient in each group. </p><p/><p>Methods for percutaneous mitral valve repair to treat mitral regurgitation are under investigation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transcatheter mitral valve repair&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LEFT VENTRICULAR RECONSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left ventricular (LV) reconstruction or volume reduction procedures were developed as potential alternatives to cardiac transplantation. This strategy grew out of earlier experience with ventricular aneurysmectomy. The procedure can produce more normal LV geometry and improve LV systolic function but a beneficial impact on clinical status and long-term survival has not been established.</p><p>In the setting of systolic heart failure (HF), the ventricular cavity size enlarges to maintain stroke volume with associated changes in ventricular geometry (the ventricle becomes less ellipsoid and more spherical). Increases in ventricular cavity size (without adequate compensatory hypertrophy) result in increases in wall stress as governed by Laplace's law (stress = [pressure x radius] &divide; [2 x wall thickness]). Increased wall stress stimulates processes that lead to further ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction. Thus, changes in size and geometry are thought to lead to progressive LV dysfunction and worsening HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac remodeling: Basic aspects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical removal or exclusion of portions of dysfunctional myocardium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infarcted territories (eg, the Dor procedure or surgical anterior ventricular endocardial restoration [SAVER]) can return the LV to a more normal cavity <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/mass</span> ratio and geometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Based upon Laplace&rsquo;s law, reduction in internal cavity dimensions leads to reduced end-systolic and end-diastolic wall stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In this way, cardiac work efficiency may be improved, which theoretically could improve the symptoms of HF. Limited evidence has shown some ventricular functional improvement following surgical reconstruction and the degree of myocardial fibrosis and myocyte hypertrophy appear to be inversely correlated with improvements in LV function after partial ventriculectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, neurohormonal activation may be reduced by LV reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, data on clinical benefit are limited and a mortality benefit has not been proven.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">STICH trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best available data on the SAVER procedure comes from the Hypothesis 2 substudy of the STICH trial in which 1000 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy were randomly assigned to either coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) alone or CABG with LV reconstruction using the SAVER technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast to the previously noted observational series, the STICH trial is the first and only randomized experience of surgical LV remodeling. Entry criteria for the randomization for LV reconstruction included coronary artery disease amenable to CABG, an LVEF &le;35 percent (mean 28 percent), and an anterior akinetic or dyskinetic region of myocardium amenable to ventricular reconstruction. Most patients had symptomatic HF.</p><p>Despite a significantly greater reduction in end-systolic volume index with CABG plus ventricular reconstruction compared to CABG alone (19 versus 6 percent), there was no significant difference in the rate of the primary outcome of death from any cause or hospitalization for cardiac causes at a median follow-up of 48 months (58 versus 59 percent respectively).</p><p>Thus, the available evidence does NOT support the routine use of surgical ventricular reconstruction in patients undergoing CABG who are similar to those enrolled in the STICH trial. For patients undergoing CABG for coronary artery disease with an LVEF &le;35 percent and a dominant anterior region of myocardial akinesis or dyskinesis, we recommend <strong>against</strong> routine concomitant surgical ventricular reconstruction.</p><p>The Hypothesis 1 portion of the STICH trial comparing medical therapy to medical therapy plus CABG (including a substudy of viability testing) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Coronary artery revascularization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1673980\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of ventricular reconstruction following STICH trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the results of the STICH trial, the role of surgical LV reconstruction as a treatment for HF is uncertain. Observational data suggest that specific clinical subgroups may benefit from the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] but controlled studies of clinical outcomes are lacking. Ventricular reconstruction may improve ventricular function but its impact on clinical outcomes has not been established.</p><p>The PARACHUTE trials are assessing the role of a nonsurgical approach to LV chamber reduction using a novel partitioning fluoropolymer membrane loaded onto a nitinol skeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When percutaneously placed into an infarcted ventricular apex (akin to an upside-down parachute), the distal chamber is partitioned from the ventricular chamber, thus modifying the functional LV size and shape. Early nonrandomized experiences suggest improvement in New York Heart Association class and certain hemodynamic measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2855073\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANICAL INHIBITION OF DILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Acorn CorCap device is a knitted polyester sock that is drawn up and anchored over the ventricles in order to limit left ventricular (LV) dilation and remodeling and improve LV ejection fraction (EF). In an unblinded trial, 193 patients with heart failure (HF) and significant mitral regurgitation requiring mitral valve surgery were randomly assigned to surgery with or without the Acorn device and an additional 107 patients not requiring mitral surgery were randomly assigned to medical therapy or medical therapy plus the Acorn device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Insertion of the device resulted in reduction in the composite end point of major cardiac procedure, worsened New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>), or death at median follow-up of two years. There were reductions in LV end-diastolic function in the device group but no differences in survival between the device and control groups at two- and three-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. At five-year follow-up limited to patients not receiving mitral surgery, there was sustained decrease in LV diastolic volume and more frequent improvement in NYHA functional class in the device group but no difference in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>The PEERLESS-HF trial studied the effect on functional end points of the HeartNet device, an elastic metal mesh device surrounding the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The trial was halted early after an interim analysis found that the device was associated with no effect in peak VO2 at six months for the first half of enrolled patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LARGELY ABANDONED PROCEDURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Batista procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As originally described, the Batista procedure, or partial left ventriculectomy (or partial left ventricular [LV] resection), involved the removal of a section of the LV free wall, between both papillary muscles and extending from the apex to the mitral annulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. An improvement in heart failure (HF) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was thought to result from a reduction in peak wall stress and possibly a more uniform pattern of LV contraction and relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Several centers demonstrated an initial increase in LVEF, reduction in heart size, and improvement in clinical functional status in the survivors over the short- and mid-term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/8,19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19-25</a>]. However, there were high early mortality rates and high rates of recurrent symptomatic HF and fatal arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/21,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25,26</a>]. In addition, only one-third of patients improved: The majority was either unchanged or worsened. Late fatal arrhythmias plagued this procedure, forcing the use of concomitant implantable defibrillators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiomyoplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiomyoplasty, also referred to as &quot;dynamic cardiomyoplasty,&quot; is a surgical therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy in which the latissimus dorsi muscle is wrapped around the heart and paced during ventricular systole. Postoperative observations suggested that progressive LV dilation could be slowed in some patients by the diastolic &quot;girdling&quot; effect of the muscle wrap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This observation led to the development of the Acorn CorCap device (see <a href=\"#H2855073\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical inhibition of dilation'</a> above). &#160;</p><p>Early enthusiasm was driven by improvements in functional capacity and ventricular remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-heart-failure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], but long-term outcome data were limited. A large, randomized clinical trial of cardiomyoplasty in New York Heart Association class III patients was prematurely terminated because of poor enrollment and modest clinical benefit.
