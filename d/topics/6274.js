It is caused primarily by <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> in the United States, and primarily <em>Borrelia afzelii,</em> <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, and <em>Borrelia garinii</em> in Europe and Asia. In the northeastern United States, rodents such as the white-footed mouse are the primary reservoir of <em>Borrelia</em> species.</p><p>Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in the United States and Europe. Because the ticks that transmit Lyme disease are frequently encountered in backyards and outdoor recreational areas, a high degree of public health awareness of Lyme disease must be maintained wherever the disease is known to occur.</p><p>The epidemiology of Lyme disease and the ecology of <em>Ixodes</em> species ticks will be reviewed here. The microbiology of Lyme disease, the evaluation of a tick bite for possible Lyme disease, and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease are discussed separately.

The etiology of Lyme disease was discovered to be a spirochete in the early 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The incidence of Lyme disease and the geographic distribution of cases in the United States has increased steadily since then [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The incidence in some regions of Europe may be increasing as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A possible reason for the increase in Lyme disease in Europe is that climate change has caused an increased density and broader geographic distribution of <em>Ixodes</em> ticks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, an increase in the deer population in the northeastern United States and changes in land management practices have contributed to the rise in incidence of Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. A particularly virulent strain of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> called OspC type A is prevalent in the northeastern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This genotype has a high transmission frequency among ticks; it may be increasing in frequency in nature, and may have been important in the emergence of Lyme disease in the northeastern United States during the late 20<sup>th</sup> century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Since reporting practices vary by location, the true incidence of Lyme disease is difficult to calculate precisely. Overall, Lyme disease is currently the most commonly reported tick-borne disease in the United States and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>From 2005 to 2014, a total of 251,061 cases of Lyme disease were reported in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67800\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67800 \">figure 1</a>). In 2014, Lyme disease was the fifth most common reportable disease in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, studies suggest that approximately 300,000 people are diagnosed with Lyme disease in the United States each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The results obtained using these estimation methods mirror the geographic distribution of cases that is shown by national surveillance.</p><p>Although all age groups are affected by Lyme disease, the distribution of cases is bimodal, with peaks in the 5 to 10 and 35 to 55 year-old age groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56037\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56037 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Over half of cases (53 percent) occur in males. This age and gender pattern may reflect the amount of time certain groups spend outdoors in contact with forested habitats.</p><p>In 2014, 14 states accounted for 96 percent of all reported cases (confirmed and probable cases combined); these states included Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80168\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80168 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Lyme disease occurs most commonly in forested regions, including some suburban areas, such as those near Boston, New York, and Philadelphia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The reported number of cases by state or locality can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html&amp;token=K/Q6h7ftM68RSpjK0XuBfvzBvgj94Q2Z3q+zKKz/RE9KaZD0jOYTQsSRCxQ+cFcv54wsUzlLzkdwahndTvmAlbso1vWkV6XjLBXz7ymzUIc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7901\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC website</a>. </p><p>Within highly endemic regions, the number of ticks and the percentage of ticks that are infected can vary greatly, depending upon local ecological features. As an example, in a 1997 report from Westchester County, New York, polymerase chain reaction of 173 <em>Ixodes scapularis</em> ticks revealed that 52 percent of adult ticks and 26 percent of nymphs were infected with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When the agent responsible for human granulocytic anaplasmosis (caused by <em>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</em>, formerly called human granulocytic ehrlichiosis) was included, 79 percent of adult ticks and 30 percent of nymphs were infected with a pathogen infectious to humans.

In Europe, as in the United States, there are regions of high prevalence of Lyme disease in forested areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The regions of Europe with the highest prevalence are Austria, Estonia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and Slovenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82648\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82648 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Field and laboratory studies show that the blacklegged tick (<em>I. scapularis</em>) is the sole competent vector of <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, the cause of Lyme disease, in the hyperendemic regions of the eastern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lyme disease is transmitted by various <em>Ixodes</em> ticks, depending on geography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

These vector ticks are forest dwellers, spending most of their time hiding in the leaf litter of the forest floor, where humidity is high and the risk of desiccation is low. Thus, Lyme disease is associated with heavily forested areas of the northern Hemisphere.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Life cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three free-living stages of <em>I. scapularis</em> ticks: the six-legged larva, the eight-legged nymph, and the dimorphic eight-legged adult tick. The larvae, nymphs, and adult females require a blood meal from a vertebrate host, whereas the adult male does not. Larvae are rarely, if ever, infected with B. burgdorferi, whereas approximately 25 percent of nymphal <em>I. scapularis</em> and 50 percent of adult female <em>I. scapularis</em> are infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p><em>I. scapularis</em> ticks in the northeastern and north central United States go through a two-year cycle from larva to nymph to adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Ixodes</em> larvae hatch in the early summer and begin questing in the late summer in the leaf litter of the forest floor. Emerging larvae search for a blood meal, usually from mice, other small mammals, or birds. Tick larvae are uninfected upon hatching, even in hyperendemic areas. The infection is acquired by the larva during its first blood meal from an infected mouse. Once infected, mice remain healthy, but they are persistently infectious. After its meal, the tick larva falls off the mouse, molts, and reemerges the next spring as a nymph.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infected nymph will spread the organism to a second host (eg, mouse, vole, chipmunk) during its blood meal in the late spring or early summer. This host then spreads the organism to future generations of larvae to complete the horizontal cycle of transmission. Once fed, the tick drops off the host and molts to an adult in the fall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult ticks seek a blood meal during warm days in the fall, winter, and early spring. Their preferred host is the white-tailed deer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the fall and winter, after feeding, the adult female tick falls to the forest floor but does not lay eggs in the leaf litter until the next spring; thus, the two-year life cycle repeats itself.</p><p/><p>Ticks seeking a meal reside on the underside of low-lying shrubs or grass. Ticks sense warmth and carbon dioxide; they will latch on to a mammal with these attributes that brushes against them. The tick must usually be attached for 36 to 48 hours before transmission of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> occurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H489530\"><span class=\"h2\">Dissemination within ticks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using live imaging of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> expressing green fluorescent protein, it has been observed that <em>B. burgdorferi</em> uses a biphasic mode of dissemination within ticks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In the first phase, replicating spirochetes form networks of nonmotile organisms that advance toward the basolateral surface of epithelial cells. In the second phase, the spirochetes become motile and penetrate the basement membrane and enter the hemocoel, before reaching and entering the salivary glands. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission to humans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nymphal stage of <em>I. scapularis</em> is the primary vector of <em>B. burgdorferi</em>. One reason that nymphal <em>I. scapularis</em> are much more effective at transmitting <em>B. burgdorferi</em> to people than are adult female <em>I. scapularis</em> is the relative size difference. Nymphal <em>I. scapularis</em> may be quite small when they first attach to people (&lt;2 mm), whereas adult female <em>I. scapularis</em> are much larger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68309\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68309 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>Nymphal ticks commonly feed on people for the minimal period required to transmit an infectious dose of spirochetes (2 days), whereas adult females rarely remain attached and escape detection for &gt;2 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of a tick bite for possible Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Tick attachment'</a>). Thus, the risk of Lyme disease is closely associated with areas where nymphal <em>I. scapularis </em>infected with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> commonly bite people. An ecological risk map study demonstrated that infected host-seeking <em>I. scapularis</em> nymphs are concentrated in the northeastern and upper midwestern United States and are much less common in the southern United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75053\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75053 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SEASONALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the Lyme disease-endemic regions of the northeastern United States, nymphal <em>I. scapularis</em> become active in mid-May, peak in activity in June, and become less active during late July. Lyme disease onset occurs mainly during the summer months of June, July, and August, since the incubation period between the tick bite and the onset of Lyme disease is approximately two to three weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70029\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70029 \">figure 7</a>). Although the life cycle of the <em>Ixodes</em> tick vectors of Lyme disease spirochetes may vary in different regions, the onset of Lyme disease generally occurs in the summer wherever it is found. Arthritis, a late disease manifestation, may present at any time of year.</p><p>In contrast to nymphs, adult <em>I. scapularis</em> generally seek hosts during the colder months from October to December and March to April, when few cases of Lyme disease are diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/37,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">RESERVOIR HOSTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the northeastern United States, the primary reservoir hosts for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> are rodents. In particular, the white-footed mouse, <em>Peromyscus leucopus</em>, was identified as the primary reservoir of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> soon after Lyme disease was described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The majority of white-footed mice are infected with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> in areas of the northeastern United States, where Lyme disease is hyperendemic. More recent work suggests that the small rodent hosts for <em>I. scapularis </em>are broader than <em>P. leucopus</em> and also commonly include chipmunks and voles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>Larval <em>I. scapularis</em> hatch from egg batches in May and seek hosts in late summer (August to September). These larvae ingest spirochetes when feeding on an infected rodent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Infected larvae molt to nymphs and then overwinter, and are ready to feed the next year in early summer (May to July), when they may feed on another rodent, bird, or human (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65153\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65153 \">figure 8</a>). Thus, the Lyme disease spirochete enzootic cycle is perpetually extended from year to year in an extremely efficient fashion.</p><p>Although small rodents, particularly white-footed mice, are central to the Lyme disease enzootic cycle, immature <em>I. scapularis</em> feed on a wide variety of hosts including a number of types of rodents, insectivores, lagomorphs, medium-sized mammals, birds, and reptiles. In suburban settings, where human dwellings exert a strong influence on the environment, other hosts such as chipmunks, squirrels, raccoons, skunks, and even shrews may come to play a larger role than white-footed mice as reservoirs of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Indeed, in certain areas of the north central United States, chipmunks may be more important than white-footed mice as reservoirs of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Birds may play a special role as reservoirs of <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, but not as enzootic reservoirs in highly endemic regions of the eastern United States. Rather, they may be phoretic hosts, carrying infected ticks to regions where <em>I. scapularis</em> and <em>B. burgdorferi</em> are not well established. In Canada, birds have been identified as a likely source of infected ticks in southern Quebec, where the Lyme disease spirochete enzootic cycle is not well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Lizards serve as hosts for immature <em>I. scapularis</em> in the southern United States. Since lizards may be relatively refractory hosts for <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, lizards may reduce tick infection rates, thus serving as &quot;zooprophylactic hosts&quot; and lowering transmission potential in the south [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the pattern of transmission seen in the eastern United States, in northern California, two intersecting cycles occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. One cycle involves western grey squirrels and <em>I. pacificus</em> ticks, which are infected with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and bite humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. Another cycle involves the dusky-footed wood rat and <em>Ixodes spinipalpis</em> (formerly <em>Ixodes neotomae</em>) ticks, which do not bite humans but maintain the cycle of <em>Borrelia bissettii</em> in nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, <em>B. bissettii</em> does not cause Lyme disease in North America. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-of-lyme-disease#H439683379\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Diversity of Lyme Disease species'</a>.)</p><p>In certain areas of Europe, where <em>B. garinii</em> is the predominant spirochete infecting humans, song birds may play a key role as reservoirs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In Japan, rodents are the main reservoir host of <em>B. garinii</em> strains that cause disease in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF DEER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adult <em>I. scapularis </em>ticks feed on larger animals, particularly deer, but will not feed on smaller hosts like rodents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Indeed, although the accepted common name for <em>I. scapularis</em> is the blacklegged tick, it is known colloquially in many areas as the deer tick. Adult females feed on deer, acquire a blood meal, and fall off into the leaf litter to lay their eggs. The dramatic rise in white-tailed deer populations during the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century played a key role in supporting the expansion of <em>I. scapularis</em> and prompting, in part, the rapid emergence of Lyme disease that began in the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. While deer are required to support <em>I. scapularis</em> populations, they do not play a role as reservoirs of the Lyme disease spirochete; indeed, deer complement appears to be lytic to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Thus, deer are important for the survival of the ticks that transmit Lyme disease but do not support the spirochetes themselves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of Lyme disease in the United States has steadily increased since its discovery in the late 1970s. It is currently the most commonly reported tick-borne disease in both the United States and Europe.

Other <em>Ixodes</em> species are the vectors of Lyme disease in certain other regions: <em>Ixodes pacificus</em> in western North America, <em>Ixodes persulcatus</em> in Asia, and <em>Ixodes ricinus</em> in Europe. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Tick vectors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The peak incidence for the onset of early Lyme disease in the eastern United States occurs during the summer months of June, July, and August (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70029\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70029 \">figure 7</a>).
