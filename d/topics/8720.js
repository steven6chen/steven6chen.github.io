Vaccination during pregnancy is warranted when the risk of exposure is high, the infection poses risks to the mother <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetus, and the vaccine is unlikely to be harmful. Vaccines appropriate for immunization before, during, and after pregnancy are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100422 \">table 1</a>).

Providers and patients should be aware that these immunizations have a good safety profile in pregnancy, can provide passive protection to the newborn, and are not associated with miscarriage. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Routine prenatal immunizations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providers should administer appropriate vaccines to pregnant women with medical or exposure indications that put them at risk for vaccine preventable infections.

(See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum immunization'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providers should be aware of and follow contraindications and precautions for immunization of pregnant women (eg, avoid administration of live attenuated virus vaccines). (See <a href=\"#H262424179\" class=\"local\">'Immunizations to avoid during pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Obstetrician-gynecologists are often the primary clinician for women of child-bearing age; as such, they are in a good position to screen for immunization status and to provide appropriate vaccinations. However, financial factors (eg, inadequate reimbursement, cost of storing vaccines) and knowledge about vaccine counseling, safety, and administration appear to be barriers to vaccine administration in <span class=\"nowrap\">OB/GYN</span> offices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-during-pregnancy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>The specific immunization guidelines in this review are based upon recommendations for residents of the United States by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ACIP statements may be viewed and downloaded from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/default.htm&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsXhOyaXu9iKWtYXtaOjXkOAVFuaF5DjbE2pCQ0cmyoiR&amp;TOPIC_ID=442\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC's website</a>.

Transplacental passage of antibodies depends on maternal concentration, antibody type (significant amounts of IgG are transported but not IgM, IgA, or IgE), IgG subtype (IgG1 is preferentially transported), and gestational age. Fetal IgG concentration is much lower than maternal concentration in the first half of pregnancy, but increases to 50 percent of maternal levels at 28 to 32 weeks of gestation, equals maternal levels by 36 weeks, and often exceeds maternal levels at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-during-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Because maternal IgG levels reach their peak about four weeks after immunization, the gestational age at maternal immunization is an important factor when passive neonatal immunity is the goal (eg, pertussis vaccine). In these cases, the ideal timing of vaccination is in the early third trimester to achieve maximum maternal antibody levels and maximum antibody transfer before delivery. </p><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malaria infections can adversely impact antibody transfer, probably due to injury to the Fc receptors in syncytiotrophoblast that actively transfer IgG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-during-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Very high maternal IgG titers overall or to specific antigens also can inhibit antibody transfer due to competitive inhibition of active transport.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3045552587\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimizing risks of infection exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women should minimize their risk of exposure to infections to which they are susceptible by avoiding travel to high-risk locations (eg, areas where yellow fever is prevalent), assuring that household members are immunized according to standard immunization schedules, and maintaining good hygienic practices (eg, hand-washing, using clean water, and cooking food adequately).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H938956639\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFETY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262421165\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccine safety by type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When immunization is performed during pregnancy, the benefits to both mother and fetus should outweigh the risks. There is no evidence of harm to pregnant women or fetuses from administration of inactivated vaccines. However, live vaccines that are considered safe in children and adults may be harmful to a developing fetus (see <a href=\"#H262421234\" class=\"local\">'Live vaccines'</a> below). They should generally be avoided during pregnancy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262421203\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxoids, inactivated vaccines, immune globulin preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxoids, inactivated virus vaccines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> preparations, and live viral and bacterial vaccines can augment an individual's immune status. All but the live vaccines are generally considered safe for administration to pregnant women, since there is no evidence that they have harmful effects on the fetus or pregnancy. </p><p>Medically indicated toxoids, inactivated virus vaccines, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> preparations are given at any gestational age, even in the first trimester, because of special risks to the unimmunized pregnant woman, fetus, or newborn. As an example, seasonal influenza vaccine should be administered as soon as it becomes available, regardless of gestational age. If prompt administration is not medically indicated, it is preferable to delay administration of these agents until the second trimester since the possibility of risk to fetal development cannot be definitively excluded. Waiting until the second trimester also helps to avoid spurious associations in the patient's mind between immunization and common adverse first trimester events (eg, miscarriage, birth defects). Additionally, vaccination between weeks 28 to 32 of gestation may optimize the transfer of antibodies to the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-during-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262421234\"><span class=\"h3\">Live vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Live vaccines have the potential for infecting the fetus. Harmful effects have not been reported in newborns of mothers who received live vaccines during pregnancy, although subclinical infection has been documented. Because a risk of fetal damage cannot be definitively excluded, use of live vaccines is <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> during pregnancy unless the pregnant woman is at substantial risk of exposure to a natural infection associated with serious morbidity or mortality. The risk-benefit ratio of administering live vaccines should be weighed individually for such patients in consultation with an infectious disease expert. As an example, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=yellow-fever-vaccine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">yellow fever vaccine</a> and the live-attenuated oral polio vaccine may be warranted for pregnant women who have a high risk of imminent exposure. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Yellow fever'</a> below and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Poliovirus'</a> below.)</p><p>If a live virus vaccine is inadvertently given to a pregnant woman, or if a woman becomes pregnant within four weeks after vaccination, she should be counseled about the potential effects on the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-during-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Termination of pregnancy is not warranted for this indication, given the absence of documented harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-during-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H262424179\" class=\"local\">'Immunizations to avoid during pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262421493\"><span class=\"h2\">Lack of autism association with immunizations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some authors have attributed regressive autism to childhood vaccine exposure (particularly measles vaccine and thimerosal [a mercury preservative used in vaccines]). However, the overwhelming majority of epidemiologic evidence does not support an association between immunizations and autism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-and-chronic-disease-no-evidence-for-vaccines-or-thimerosal-as-a-contributing-factor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder and chronic disease: No evidence for vaccines or thimerosal as a contributing factor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although some vaccines given to adults contain thimerosal, there is no evidence that thimerosal-containing vaccines cause adverse effects in offspring of women who received these vaccines during pregnancy. The ACIP does not recommend avoidance of thimerosal-containing vaccines for any group, including pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-during-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Adults who develop pertussis can transmit the disease to susceptible infants in the household, which is a concern because infants under three months of age are at highest risk of morbidity and mortality from this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-during-pregnancy/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>].

Pre-exposure smallpox vaccination is <strong>not</strong> recommended for women who are pregnant (any trimester), women contemplating pregnancy within 28 days, women who are breastfeeding, or close contacts (household member, sex partner) of women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy within 28 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-during-pregnancy/abstract/11,80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,80-82</a>].

In a study of over 1154,000 infants born to women in the military, including 37,140 born to women who had ever received AVA, birth defects were slightly more common in first trimester-exposed infants compared with infants of women vaccinated outside of the first trimester (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.997-1.41), never-vaccinated (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.42), or vaccinated postpartum (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.43) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-during-pregnancy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

In particular, for susceptible women of childbearing age who may become pregnant, ensuring immunity against measles, mumps, and rubella and varicella is important since these immunizations are contraindicated during pregnancy and infection in nonimmune pregnant women can adversely affect pregnancy outcome. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Preconception immunization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before administering any vaccine, reasonable practices include asking the woman if she is pregnant or could become pregnant in the next four weeks and counseling her about the potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy or just before conception. Routine pregnancy testing of women of childbearing age before administering a vaccine, even a live-virus vaccine, is not necessary as long as pregnancy can reasonably be excluded by history. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Preconception immunization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Live vaccines are generally avoided during pregnancy because of a theoretical risk to the fetus. Pregnancy should be avoided for 28 days following administration of a live vaccine. However, when pregnancy occurs within one month of immunization with the live measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=yellow-fever-vaccine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">yellow fever vaccine</a>, or oral polio vaccine, teratogenesis has not been reported. Therefore, termination of pregnancy for exposure to these vaccines is unwarranted. (See <a href=\"#H262421234\" class=\"local\">'Live vaccines'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Preconception immunization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women should minimize their risk of exposure to infections to which they are susceptible by avoiding travel to high-risk locations (eg, areas where yellow fever is prevalent), assuring that household members are immunized according to standard immunization schedules, and maintaining good hygienic practices. (See <a href=\"#H3045552587\" class=\"local\">'Minimizing risks of infection exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During influenza season, we recommend that all pregnant women receive the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> regardless of trimester of pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Influenza is particularly morbid in pregnant women and can be prevented by vaccination. Maternal immunization additionally provides passive protection to the infant in the first few months of life. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Inactivated influenza vaccine'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Influenza and pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend administration of the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) to all pregnant women in each pregnancy between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation (and preferably during the earlier part of this period), even if the woman has a previous history of pertussis or vaccination (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Tdap is given to reduce the risk of maternal pertussis, and thus transmission to the infant, in whom pertussis can be lethal or have significant morbidity. Placental transfer of maternal antibodies may provide a degree of passive protection of the infant against pertussis for two to six months. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women with comorbidities or exposures that place them at high risk for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, pneumococcal, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> b, or meningococcal infections can receive these immunizations. (See <a href=\"#H262423670\" class=\"local\">'Pre-exposure prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If travel to high-risk areas cannot be avoided, inactivated travel vaccines, such as for poliovirus and typhoid fever, can be administered prior to travel. If the risk of yellow fever exposure is expected to be higher than the risk of vaccination, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=yellow-fever-vaccine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">yellow fever vaccine</a>, a live attenuated vaccine, can be administered in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. In cases where the risk of disease is low but vaccination is an international travel requirement, a medical waiver can be issued. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Poliovirus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Typhoid'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Yellow fever'</a> above and <a href=\"#H356073732\" class=\"local\">'Other travel vaccines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination during pregnancy is typically avoided. However, women who inadvertently receive HPV vaccine during pregnancy can be reassured that there is no evidence of adverse pregnancy or fetal outcomes with vaccination. They may resume the series when postpartum. (See <a href=\"#H262424949\" class=\"local\">'Human papillomavirus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Like other live vaccines, MMR and varicella vaccines are generally avoided during pregnancy. For nonimmune women, MMR and varicella vaccines are given postpartum, ideally prior to discharge. MMR and varicella vaccines can be given safely to postpartum women who are breastfeeding and to the children of pregnant women, since the virus is not transmitted through breast milk or casual contact. Tdap is given postpartum to women who did not receive it during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H262425104\" class=\"local\">'Measles, mumps, rubella'</a> above and <a href=\"#H262425443\" class=\"local\">'Varicella'</a> above and <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum immunization'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Englund JA.
