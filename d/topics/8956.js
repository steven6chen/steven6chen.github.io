Inadequate oxygenation, mechanical obstruction (eg, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax), neurologic dysfunction (eg, high-spinal cord injury), and cardiac dysfunction represent other potential causes or contributing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Hemorrhagic shock is a common and frequently treatable cause of death in injured patients and is second only to traumatic brain injury as the leading cause of death from trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the initial management of hemorrhagic shock in the adult trauma patient. General management of the adult trauma patient, subsequent management of trauma-related hemorrhage, and other aspects of shock, including management of non-hemorrhagic shock, pathophysiology, and differential diagnosis, are discussed separately.

Clinicians should note that significant drops in blood pressure are generally not manifested until Class III hemorrhage develops, and up to 30 percent of a patient's blood volume can be lost before this occurs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class I hemorrhage involves a blood volume loss of up to 15 percent.

Any hypotension (SBP less than 90 mmHg) or drop in blood pressure greater than 20 to 30 percent of the measurement at presentation is cause for concern. While diminished anxiety or pain may contribute to such a drop, the clinician must assume it is due to hemorrhage until proven otherwise. Heart rate (&ge;120 and thready) and respiratory rate are markedly elevated, while urine output is diminished. Capillary refill is delayed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class IV hemorrhage involves more than 40 percent blood volume loss leading to significant depression in blood pressure and mental status.

Nevertheless, a few key principles guide the management of hemorrhage due to trauma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resuscitation using intravenous (IV) fluids should be used only for hypotensive patients, and then only until blood is available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood products should be given as soon as the need for transfusion is recognized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood products (ie, red blood cells, plasma [clotting factors], and platelets) should be given in equivalent amounts &ndash; in other words, in a 1:1:1 ratio. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thromboelastography, or comparable rapid point-of-care assessment of coagulation, should be used to guide trauma resuscitation whenever available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Treatment of hemorrhage with IV crystalloid increases the risk of coagulopathy from dilution of clotting factors and platelets, and possibly hypothermia. To avoid these complications in injured patients, treatment with IV fluid should be avoided whenever possible and, if unavoidable, given in the smallest volumes necessary, until blood products become available. The choice of fluid remains a subject of debate and such issues are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2226562376\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous fluid resuscitation'</a> below.)</p><p>Trauma patients with severe hemorrhage need blood. To limit the adverse systemic effects of injury (eg, coagulopathy) and minimize the risks associated with large-scale transfusion, blood products &ndash; red blood cells, plasma, and platelets &ndash; are best given in a ratio of 1:1:1. The evidence supporting this approach is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;, section on 'Trauma'</a>.)</p><p>The reduction in mortality observed in severely hemorrhaging trauma patients that received higher ratios of plasma and platelets to packed red blood cells (PRBCs) has contributed to the development of &quot;Damage Control Resuscitation&quot; (DCR), often used in combination with Damage Control Surgery. The goal of DCR is to control hemorrhage rapidly and prevent coagulopathy by minimizing crystalloid use and transfusing early, using relatively high ratios of plasma and platelets to red blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. This may entail allowing patients to remain relatively hypotensive during some portion of their resuscitation (so-called permissive hypotension). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of damage control surgery and resuscitation in patients sustaining severe injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These guiding principles apply to all adult trauma patients, although their application and the details of management will vary according to the clinical scenario. Specific guidance for important and common clinical scenarios is provided below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2226562376\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous fluid resuscitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid resuscitation in trauma, including the optimal type and volume, remains the subject of considerable debate. If blood products are not immediately available, we suggest that initial fluid resuscitation for trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock consist of 500 cc boluses of isotonic saline (ie, normal saline, abbreviated as NS) given as rapidly as possible through short, large gauge (16 or larger) peripheral IVs. Fluid resuscitation using such boluses continues until blood products are available or a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 90 mmHg is achieved. Central venous catheters are used when peripheral IVs are not available. </p><p>Many hospitals have blood products immediately available in the emergency department (ED). In such hospitals, immediate transfusion of blood products, rather than fluid resuscitation, can be performed for patients with severe hemorrhage in obvious need of transfusion. </p><p>One prospective observational study looking at goal directed resuscitation in the prehospital setting found that infusions of more than 500 mL of crystalloid were associated with worse outcomes in patients without hypotension (defined as a SBP &gt;90), but not in patients with hypotension, suggesting that resuscitation should be goal directed based on the presence or absence of hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. With severely injured patients, our goal is to minimize crystalloid administration while avoiding significant hypotension, until blood is available. The transition from crystalloid to blood should occur as early as possible in unstable trauma patients. Excessive infusion of crystalloid (ie, ratio of crystalloid to PRBCs &gt;1.5:1) has been associated with worse outcomes in patients with severe hemorrhage, according to observational data, and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>The ideal resuscitation fluid for injured patients remains unclear. Infusions of large volumes of NS can lead to the development of a non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. On the other hand, large volume resuscitation using lactated ringers (LR) can cause a metabolic alkalosis, as lactate metabolism generates bicarbonate. However, the typical volumes of either NS or LR used during a trauma resuscitation do not appear to have significant clinical consequences. Harm can ensue in cases when excessive amounts of either fluid are given to a patient at increased risk (eg, patient with acute renal injury caused by hypoperfusion during a period of hemorrhagic shock). LR and blood must be infused through separate IV tubing because of the risk of clotting, which may be problematic in the setting of trauma. A retrospective study of just over 3000 trauma patients resuscitated with isotonic crystalloid found no negative effect in patients given 1 L of fluid or less but reported a two-fold increase in mortality among patients who received 1.5 L or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Debate over the best approach to fluid resuscitation in traumatic shock is likely to continue. A systematic review of prehospital fluid resuscitation in trauma found insufficient evidence for the superiority of any particular fluid type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some researchers claim LR is superior to NS in the resuscitation of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock, stating that patients who receive large volumes of NS experience increased blood loss and greater hypercoagulability; other researchers argue just the opposite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. We prefer NS for the initial resuscitation fluid, but are not recommending against the use of LR (L-isomer if available). Harm from either is highly unlikely if used in limited (2 L or less) amounts. </p><p>Clear end-points for fluid therapy remain undefined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Further resuscitation is based on the patient's response to initial IV fluids and overall condition. A mean arterial pressure (MAP) around 65 mmHg or an SBP around 90 mmHg is a reasonable goal in penetrating trauma (MAP = [(2 x diastolic) + <span class=\"nowrap\">systolic]/3)</span>. In blunt trauma patients, particularly those with possible traumatic brain injury (TBI), a MAP above 85 mmHg or a SBP above 120 mmHg is reasonable. These goals may need to be adjusted upward in patients with a known history of uncontrolled hypertension.</p><p>The ideal MAP or SBP for the severely injured trauma patient remains unclear. Most experts advocate strictly limiting the amount of IV fluid used for trauma resuscitation in the absence of hypotension or obvious injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition to the potentially harmful effects of excess IV fluid on coagulation and blood counts, patients with heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and other conditions sensitive to rapid increases in intravascular volume may decompensate from such resuscitation. Careful, continual monitoring of these patients is crucial.</p><p>Hypertonic saline has been evaluated extensively, and may provide benefit through osmotic movement of interstitial fluid into the vascular compartment and modulation of the inflammatory response to injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. While some clinical trials have shown improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], others have failed to do so, even in patients who would seem most likely to benefit (eg, patients with hypotension and severe TBI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Further study is needed to clarify the role of hypertonic saline.</p><p>The value of colloids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=albumin-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albumin solution</a>, dextran) for resuscitation of traumatic shock is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Colloids effectively increase intravascular volume and may maintain plasma oncotic pressure at more normal levels compared with crystalloids. However, a systematic review of trials comparing resuscitation fluids found that use of colloids did not improve mortality or morbidity among trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Colloid versus crystalloid'</a>.) </p><p>Research continues into oxygen-carrying resuscitation fluids that can serve as alternatives to PRBCs. The ideal replacement fluid would transport oxygen effectively, expand intravascular volume, exhibit few or no side effects, and demonstrate great durability. Potential replacement fluids are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen carriers as alternatives to red blood cell transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3100049699\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed fluid resuscitation/controlled hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Questions remain whether reversal of hypovolemia or control of hemorrhage should take priority in trauma resuscitation. A growing number of researchers describe aggressive fluid administration as ineffective and potentially harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/7,9,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,21,22</a>], and suggest that limited volume replacement that maintains minimally adequate organ perfusion may improve outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This strategy has been referred to as delayed fluid resuscitation, controlled hypotension, permissive hypotension, hypotensive resuscitation, or controlled resuscitation, all of which describe an approach that targets early fluid resuscitation only to a SBP of greater than 70 mmHg. </p><p>Controlled hypotension may be beneficial in patients with hemorrhagic shock due to torso injuries from gunshot or stab wounds. However, it may be detrimental to blunt trauma patients with brain injury, as hypotension reduces cerebral perfusion and increases mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The rationale for improved outcomes with delayed fluid resuscitation is that aggressive fluid administration might, via augmentation of blood pressure, dilution of clotting factors, and production of hypothermia, disrupt thrombus formation and enhance bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>In one widely cited prospective study of 598 patients with penetrating chest injuries treated at a major trauma center, delayed fluid resuscitation until operative intervention to control bleeding was associated with a statistically significant improvement in patient survival (70 versus 62 percent in those given immediate fluid repletion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Care must be taken when extrapolating the results of this trial. Stratification was not performed to identify which patients might benefit from delayed therapy, subjects were primarily young and healthy, and the mean time from injury to operation was two hours, results that are not attainable in most circumstances.</p><p>In a preliminary analysis of a trial conducted at another major trauma center, 90 young adults with penetrating (n = 84) or blunt (n = 6) trauma resulting in at least one SBP reading below 90 mmHg, and hemorrhage requiring immediate laparotomy or thoracotomy, were randomly assigned upon arrival to the operating theater to resuscitation using a low-goal mean arterial pressure of 50 mmHg (LMAP group) or a high-goal mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg (HMAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Among the patients excluded were those with traumatic brain injury. Anesthesiologists did not intervene to lower the blood pressure of patients in the LMAP group whose MAP exceeded 50 mmHg. Patients in the LMAP group had lower postoperative mortality (6 versus 10 deaths), received fewer blood products (1594 versus 2898 mL), and did not develop coagulopathy or multiple organ failure (MOF), compared to seven cases of coagulopathy and two cases of MOF in the HMAP group. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in overall mortality at 30 days. </p><p>Other results favoring controlled hypotension or controlled resuscitation for both penetrating and blunt trauma patients include European guidelines published in 2013 recommending a target SBP of 80 to 90 mmHg until major bleeding has been stopped in the initial phase following trauma without brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Another randomized trial conducted by The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) published in 2015 concluded that controlled resuscitation (defined as SBP &gt;70 mmHg) is achievable in out-of-hospital and hospital settings and may offer an early survival advantage in blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>The results of these studies notwithstanding, adoption of the strategy of delayed fluid resuscitation or controlled hypotension into clinical practice must be undertaken cautiously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Factors that should be considered when determining whether this strategy is appropriate include the patient's mental status and likelihood of intracranial injury, likelihood of spinal cord injury (SCI), underlying illness such as chronic hypertension and proximity to a trauma center. Further research to determine the appropriateness and effectiveness of this approach is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Based on current data, limiting fluid resuscitation to 1 L or less and moving directly to blood products appears to be the best strategy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2075458749\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusion of blood products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When to begin blood transfusion remains an important, unanswered question in trauma research, and often depends on clinical circumstances. As an example, immediate transfusion of PRBCs, plasma, and platelets is needed when exsanguination is imminent, such as a patient with a thoracic injury whose chest tube releases over 2 L of blood upon placement. Another patient with a self-inflicted wrist laceration may not require any blood, despite being hypotensive, because hemorrhage is promptly controlled, the wound is easily repaired, and comorbidities are absent. Thus, the best approach to transfusion varies by clinical scenario; common and important scenarios are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H606165751\" class=\"local\">'Management according to clinical scenario'</a> below.) </p><p>Typed and cross-matched PRBCs are best, but can require considerable time to prepare. If the patient's condition warrants, clinicians can transfuse immediately using type O Rh-positive or type O Rh-negative for males and type O Rh-negative for girls and women of child-bearing age, until type-specific or typed and cross-matched blood is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most instances, preparation of fully typed and cross-matched blood requires at least 20 minutes, and more likely 30 to 45 minutes. Type-specific blood can usually be obtained within 15 to 20 minutes. In general, type O blood is available immediately, depending on transport time from the blood bank to the ED. Trauma centers often store type O blood in refrigerators in the ED.</p><p>The safety of the blood supply continues to improve, and although some risk of transmitting infectious agents persists, such events are rare. Transfusion-associated infection is discussed separately.

The hospital's massive transfusion protocol (MTP) should be activated immediately in such circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H1848358262\" class=\"local\">'Massive transfusion protocol'</a> below.)</p><p>In other words, as soon as the treating clinician recognizes that the patient will require 4 or more units of PRBCs over one hour (or 10 or more units over 6 hours), he or she should begin transfusing 6 units of PRBCs, 6 units of FFP, and 6 units of random donor platelets (or 1 unit of apheresis platelets). Note that 1 unit of apheresis platelets is equivalent to 6 units of non-apheresis (ie, random donor or whole-blood derived) platelets. Evidence to support this approach of transfusing components in a 1:1:1 ratio is presented separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1012810632\" class=\"local\">'Antifibrinolytic agents'</a> below.)</p><p>Hypothermia must be controlled during transfusions. Where available, thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) provide faster and more accurate assessment of coagulopathy in the trauma patient, and can help guide ongoing treatment with clotting factors as well as reduce unnecessary transfusion.

Traditionally, a massive transfusion was considered 10 units of PRBCs or more transfused over a 24-hour period, but many experts now advocate a revised definition of 10 units or more transfused over 6 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. We prefer the revised definition.</p><p>Determining when to initiate an MTP has been the subject of considerable research. As early implementation of massive transfusion in the appropriate patient improves outcomes, identifying those trauma patients early in their ED course is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. While a number of scores have been developed for this purpose, the Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) score has been validated and is easy to use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The ABC score relies on 4 parameters that can be determined upon arrival to the ED: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penetrating mechanism of injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) examination (ie, evidence of hemorrhage) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SBP of 90 mmHg or less </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart rate of 120 beats per minute (bpm) or greater </p><p/><p>Each positive parameter receives a score of one. A score of 2 or more predicts the need for massive transfusion with a sensitivity of 75 percent and a specificity of 86 percent. </p><p>If ultrasound is not available, another study group uses a &quot;Code Red&quot; determination by prehospital physicians to request that massive transfusion resources be available upon arrival to the ED. The designation is based on three parameters: suspicion or evidence of active bleeding, SBP less than 90 mmHg, and lack of a blood pressure response to an IV fluid bolus. Ninety-one percent of patients meeting any of these criteria ended up receiving blood products, and 40 percent of those went on to require a massive transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Other scores have been described, including the Trauma-Associated Severe Hemorrhage (TASH) score, Emergency Transfusion Score (ETS), and the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].

If apheresis platelets are used, this becomes a 6:6:1 ratio of PRBCs, FFP, and apheresis platelets respectively. (See <a href=\"#H2028212160\" class=\"local\">'Severe ongoing hemorrhage'</a> above.)</p><p>Hypothermia must be controlled during transfusions. Where available, thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) provide faster and more accurate assessment of coagulopathy in the trauma patient, and can help guide ongoing treatment with clotting factors as well as reduce unnecessary transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma#H3046566855\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;, section on 'Thromboelastography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma#H184662298\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;, section on 'Thromboelastography-based transfusion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3565583670\"><span class=\"h3\">Bleeding readily controlled in ED</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe bleeding can sometimes be controlled effectively in the ED or trauma bay. Closure of scalp lacerations and compression of venous extremity wounds reduce the threat of further bleeding, even though significant hemorrhage may have occurred. Application of a tourniquet can prevent further bleeding from what would otherwise be a life-threatening extremity wound. </p><p>Whether to transfuse after bleeding has been controlled depends on the clinical situation and the patient's underlying comorbidities. Patients that are experiencing symptoms due to anemia from blood loss may require transfusion even after bleeding is well controlled. As an example, a patient with coronary artery disease who is experiencing chest pain suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome should be given blood. The hemoglobin thresholds for patients with comorbidities are discussed separately and summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F93934\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93934 \">table 1</a>).

Therefore, we do not recommend transfusion in this situation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1333252988\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion in the patient to be transferred</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians transferring trauma patients for definitive care must determine what fluids or blood products to send with the patient. The answer depends on the clinical scenario, including the extent of known or suspected injuries, the blood products available, and the capabilities of the transport team. </p><p>Radiology studies in patients to be transferred should be kept to a minimum and focus only on identifying pathology that the transferring center is capable of addressing. Transfer must not be delayed to perform radiology or laboratory studies that cannot be acted on prior to transfer. </p><p>Sometimes it is necessary to transfer a patient being actively resuscitated for as yet unknown injuries. In these situations, we recommend limiting the administration of crystalloid prior to transfer (in part to prevent infusions of large volumes during transfer), and emphasizing transfusion of blood products in a 1:1:1 ratio whenever possible. We exceed two liters of crystalloid only if blood products are not available. If only one blood product can accompany the patient during transfer, PRBCs should be taken, bearing in mind the ultimate goal of giving a 1:1:1 ratio of blood products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Prior to arrival at a trauma center where definitive management of the bleeding can take place, a goal of SBP &gt;90 with a MAP of 65 mmHg for penetrating trauma, and a MAP of 85 mmHg for blunt trauma with possible head injury is appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1319924143\"><span class=\"h3\">Spinal cord injury in the setting of hemorrhagic shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a spinal cord injury (SCI) who are in hemorrhagic shock pose a special challenge. While controlled hypotension may be appropriate for many trauma patients, those with SCI, like those with traumatic brain injury, are at greater risk for complications from hypotension. Thus, a higher blood pressure is needed to ensure adequate perfusion of the spinal cord. Guidelines from 2013 recommend maintaining a MAP of at least 85 to 90 mmHg for patients with SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], and subsequent studies support this goal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Acute SCI and the management of TBI are discussed separately.

Therefore, transfusion of blood products is prioritized. However, long-term morbidity in such patients depends largely upon the ability to maintain MAP in the goal range. Thus, vasopressor therapy should be added expeditiously if an appropriate MAP cannot be achieved with blood products alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-vasopressors-and-inotropes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of vasopressors and inotropes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with SCI and hemorrhagic shock, we recommend transfusing blood as described above for patients with severe ongoing bleeding, with the goal of maintaining a MAP of 85 to 90 mmHg. Vasopressor therapy is needed for patients with SCI when blood products alone have failed to raise or maintain the MAP in the 85 to 90 mmHg range. While there is no clearly defined combination of blood products and vasopressor treatment for these patients, norepinephrine is recommended over dopamine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> by some authorities when vasopressors are required for patients with SCI, and we concur with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>Patients with SCI and hemorrhagic shock who are being transferred should be sent with both blood products and norepinephrine, assuming each is available, and managed using the same approach: give blood products first and add the vasopressor if MAP goals are not achieved. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1951041544\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnant patient with hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for and general approach to fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion do not differ in the pregnant trauma patient.

Thromboelastography (TEG), or comparable rapid point-of-care assessment of coagulation, should be used to guide trauma resuscitation whenever available. However, in many community hospitals, such resources are not available. In such cases, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) around 65 mmHg or a systolic blood pressure (SBP) around 90 mmHg is a reasonable goal for patients with penetrating trauma. For blunt trauma patients, particularly those with possible traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI), a MAP above 85 mmHg or a SBP above 120 mmHg is reasonable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Some authors advocate strictly limiting the amount of intravenous (IV) fluid used for trauma resuscitation in the absence of hypotension or obvious injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], while others have questioned the value of this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In adult trauma patients with significant injuries, our goal is to minimize crystalloid administration while avoiding hypotension, until blood is available. Packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets are transfused if the goal blood pressure is not maintained following the administration of IV boluses of isotonic crystalloid. (See <a href=\"#H606165751\" class=\"local\">'Management according to clinical scenario'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2226562376\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous fluid resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p>Some trauma patients, particularly in community hospitals, must be managed in the emergency department (ED) for prolonged periods when surgical resources or transport is not immediately available. It remains unclear which endpoints are most useful for guiding such resuscitations.

Noninvasive monitoring in these studies included such technologies as thoracic electrical bioimpedance, esophageal Doppler monitoring, and orthogonal spectral imaging, in addition to standard measures, such as MAP, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and carbon dioxide tension.

Emergency clinicians should consult a trauma surgeon as soon as possible for all victims of significant trauma who may require operative or critical care interventions. If the patient must be transferred for definitive care, early communication with a trauma center and preparation for transfer is performed concurrently with assessment and stabilization. The lack of adequate resources to manage a patient's injuries, including specialty and subspecialty care, is an indication for transfer to a trauma center. In cases involving a hypotensive patient with an identified injury (eg, high-grade splenic laceration), but no trauma surgeon is available, emergent consultation with a general surgeon may be necessary for possible laparotomy prior to a time-consuming transfer that would put the patient at risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3772339605\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVELOPING TREATMENTS FOR HEMORRHAGE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2547238854\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemostatic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some circumstances, external hemorrhage cannot be controlled using direct pressure and standard dressings.

Individual patients with severe injuries, including the young and healthy and the elder adult taking cardiovascular medications, may not manifest obvious signs of shock initially. Careful assessment and reassessment of patients involved in significant trauma is crucial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2653399771\" class=\"local\">'Classification of hemorrhage'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massive hemorrhage can occur in the chest, abdomen, retroperitoneum, and from major external wounds. The thigh can hold up to approximately 1 L of blood. Scalp lacerations can bleed profusely and are often overlooked. Non-hemorrhagic causes of traumatic shock are discussed separately, and a detailed list is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63698 \">table 3</a>).

Key principles for the management of hemorrhage due to trauma include the following (see <a href=\"#H4288752133\" class=\"local\">'Guiding principles for resuscitation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H606165751\" class=\"local\">'Management according to clinical scenario'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Resuscitation using intravenous fluids should be used only for hypotensive patients, and then only until blood is available. (See <a href=\"#H2226562376\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous fluid resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood products should be given as soon as the need for transfusion is recognized. (See <a href=\"#H2075458749\" class=\"local\">'Transfusion of blood products'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood products (ie, red blood cells, plasma [clotting factors], and platelets) should be given in equivalent amounts (1:1:1 ratio). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thromboelastography, or comparable rapid point-of-care assessment of coagulation, should be used to guide trauma resuscitation whenever available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For trauma patients with severe, ongoing hemorrhage that is unlikely to be controlled quickly or adequately, we suggest immediate transfusion of blood products in a 1:1:1 ratio of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Appropriate quantities of either random donor or apheresis platelets may be used (6 units of random donor platelets equals 1 unit of apheresis platelets). (See <a href=\"#H2028212160\" class=\"local\">'Severe ongoing hemorrhage'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In trauma patients with severe hemorrhage who are receiving blood transfusions, additional elements of care include preventing hypothermia, avoiding all unnecessary infusions of fluids other than blood products, and treating with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> when indicated. (See <a href=\"#H1012810632\" class=\"local\">'Antifibrinolytic agents'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitals that regularly care for trauma patients should institute a massive transfusion protocol. (See <a href=\"#H1848358262\" class=\"local\">'Massive transfusion protocol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of clinical scenarios other than severe ongoing hemorrhage is described in the text:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderate ongoing hemorrhage (see <a href=\"#H3839640074\" class=\"local\">'Moderate ongoing hemorrhage'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Readily controlled hemorrhage (see <a href=\"#H3565583670\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding readily controlled in ED'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemorrhage in patient requiring transfer (see <a href=\"#H1333252988\" class=\"local\">'Fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion in the patient to be transferred'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spinal cord injury and hemorrhage (see <a href=\"#H1319924143\" class=\"local\">'Spinal cord injury in the setting of hemorrhagic shock'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pregnant patient with hemorrhage (see <a href=\"#H1951041544\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant patient with hemorrhage'</a> above) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During resuscitation, do not allow an initial favorable response to volume replacement or blood transfusion to distract from possible severe, occult injury.
