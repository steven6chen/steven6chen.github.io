A number of potential post-transplant risks and complications must be addressed to ensure the best prognosis.</p><p>This topic discusses the care of patients with thalassemia who have undergone HCT, divided into two sections: completion of the transplant (eg, optimizing engraftment and immune status) and subsequent management, including assessment and therapy for excess iron stores; organ damage, which is often related to iron overload; and late complications of transplant such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).</p><p>A general review of the treatment of thalassemia as well as indications for HCT, pretransplant evaluation, donor selection, stem cell source, conditioning regimen, and immediate post-transplant hematopoietic support are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of the thalassemias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for transfusion-dependent thalassemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97229138\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLETION OF THE TRANSPLANT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial post-transplant management focuses on engraftment of the allogeneic hematopoietic cells and restoration of normal immune status. Important aspects of care include assessing and optimizing engraftment, treating infections, managing acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and tapering immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515563425\"><span class=\"h2\">Engraftment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For transplant to be effective, the donor hematopoietic cells need to engraft sufficiently to support hematopoiesis and non-thalassemic erythropoiesis. Engraftment is typically indicated by return of hematopoiesis in all three cell lines (white blood cells [WBCs], red blood cells [RBCs], and platelets) with decreasing need for transfusional support in the immediate post-transplant period.</p><p>The complete blood count (CBC) is monitored daily while the patient is hospitalized and frequently (eg, twice weekly) once the patient has been discharged from the hospital through the second post-transplant month. Once the patient is transfusion-free, hemoglobin analysis and chimerism testing using bone marrow cells are performed to confirm engraftment. Genetic testing can be substituted for hemoglobin analysis but is not routinely performed.</p><p>Engraftment status is routinely analyzed in the bone marrow. We perform this assessment at 30 and 60 days post-transplant (days +30 and +60). This includes determination of bone marrow cellularity and the degree of chimerism. If complete chimerism (full engraftment) is established, no further bone marrow examination is scheduled. If the patient is a mixed chimera, additional bone marrow examinations are performed, which we do at days +180, +365, and +730 (ie, at 6, 12, and 24 months). Additional bone marrow examinations are also performed based on clinical indications such as unexplained decreases in hemoglobin levels or decreased proportion of donor hematopoietic cells.</p><p>Engraftment is seen in the majority of patients who undergo HCT (eg, in 80 to 90 percent). This rate of engraftment was illustrated in a 2017 series of 176 children and adolescents who underwent allogeneic HCT for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (median age 5.5 years), in which 15 (9 percent) had primary graft rejection and 25 (14 percent) had secondary graft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most of the secondary graft rejection occurred within the first year (19 of 25 [76 percent]). Of the 17 who had a second transplant due to graft failure, three had graft failure again. Engraftment typically takes two to three weeks, but chimerism can take up to two years to stabilize.</p><p>The degree of chimerism (relative contributions of donor and host cells) is routinely assessed as a component of engraftment. Several methods have been used to assess chimerism after HCT. These methods all depend on the ability to detect and quantify a polymorphic marker that differs between donor and recipient. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of the Y chromosome (eg, by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]) if the donor and recipient are a different sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molecular typing for polymorphisms in DNA microsatellites (also called short tandem repeats [STRs]) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molecular typing for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and <span class=\"nowrap\">insertion/deletion</span> polymorphisms using PCR amplification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, mostly in nonindustrialized countries</p><p/><p>STR analysis remains one of the most commonly used methods, and it can be automated using capillary electrophoresis with fluorescence detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Standardization of results has been facilitated by an international effort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Possible outcomes range from full donor engraftment, various degrees of mixed chimerism, or graft rejection with thalassemia recurrence or marrow aplasia. It can take up to two years for the source of hematopoiesis to stabilize. Changes have been reported after longer intervals, but this is less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H954903929\"><span class=\"h3\">Full donor engraftment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Full donor engraftment occurs when the donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are fully responsible for hematopoiesis with no detectable contribution from recipient hematopoietic cells. This is also referred to as &quot;complete chimerism&quot; or &quot;full chimerism.&quot; When sustained, it is interpreted as cure of the thalassemia. This is the most common outcome after successful HCT for thalassemia and is seen in 60 to 90 percent of individuals, with higher rates in those with optimal pretransplant and donor characteristics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia#H801575\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for transfusion-dependent thalassemia&quot;, section on 'Indications and predictors of a good outcome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1411122622\"><span class=\"h3\">Mixed chimerism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mixed chimerism occurs when both donor and recipient hematopoietic cells are contributing to hematopoiesis at a level that can be detected molecularly. Chimerism is a dynamic condition in which contributions of donor and recipient cells vary greatly as the bone marrow stem cell niche becomes repopulated, which can take up to two years to stabilize (see <a href=\"#H2515563425\" class=\"local\">'Engraftment'</a> above). Thus, chimerism can be transient (typically defined as during the first two years after transplant) or stable (persisting beyond two years). Some individuals have transient mixed chimerism while others have stable mixed chimerism for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>].</p><p>We do not intervene in individuals with mixed chimerism unless they have evidence that the graft is failing (eg, unexplained drop of hemoglobin level or decrease in the ratio of mixed chimerism [eg, from 70 to 50 percent or less]). In these individuals, it is critical to determine whether worsening anemia is in fact due to graft failure (or impending graft failure) as other causes of anemia can arise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Options for individuals with graft failure are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3334313685\" class=\"local\">'Graft failure'</a> below.)</p><p>We monitor the percentage of mixed chimerism regularly. This can be stratified according to the proportion of donor and recipient hematopoietic cells (eg, residual recipient [host] cells &lt;10 percent, between 10 and 25 percent, or &gt;25 percent). In principle, the degree of chimerism can differ in the bone marrow and peripheral blood or can differ in different cell lines since some progenitor cells may produce more mature progeny than others, although most individuals do not have large variations when chimerism markers are tested in different cell populations.</p><p>Dynamic changes in the percentage of donor cells were illustrated in a 1996 study that included 35 individuals who underwent transplant for thalassemia and had persistent mixed chimerism during a one-year period of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Of these, 20 gradually converted to full donor hematopoiesis (100 percent donor cells), while the remaining 15 had a functioning graft in coexistence with host cells. A detailed analysis was performed on the three patients with the longest period of follow-up, which showed the following variations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One individual had stable, equivalent proportions of donor cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One individual had similar proportion of donor cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood for over two years and then developed a shift in which there were 25 percent donor cells in the bone marrow versus 75 percent donor cells in the peripheral blood; this ratio was also stable for over two years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One individual had 20 percent donor cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood for two years, which then shifted to 50 percent donor cells in both sites; however, the peripheral blood cell lines differed, with 50 percent donor cells in the granulocyte series versus 75 percent donor cells in the erythrocyte series.</p><p/><p>All had stable hemoglobin levels and were transfusion-independent, which is the most important parameter for clinical management. Other studies have reported similar variability in levels of donor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Most individuals with mixed chimerism have sufficient donor hematopoiesis to correct the thalassemic phenotype and avoid transfusions. Some authors have suggested that approximately 3 to 10 percent donor cells is sufficient for functional correction in the hemoglobinopathies based on case reports of stable mixed chimerism with donor hematopoiesis as low as 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p>Factors that determine the likelihood of mixed chimerism include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age of the recipient (greater likelihood of mixed chimerism in children than adults).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditioning regimen (greater likelihood of mixed chimerism with lower dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Source of stem cells. It is possible that use of hematopoietic cells from cord blood rather than bone marrow is associated with greater reciprocal tolerance between donor and host hematopoietic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a series that included 27 children with thalassemia who received a cord blood transplant from a related donor, all showed engraftment with mixed chimerism at the time of hematopoietic engraftment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Approximately one-half converted to full donor chimerism (eight within six months and five within one year), and the remaining 14 showed stable mixed chimerism at a median follow-up of 42 months. By comparison, graft failure occurred in three of 42 children (7 percent) in the same series who received bone marrow from a related donor and in 5 of 37 children (14 percent) in the same series who received bone marrow from an unrelated donor. Further studies evaluating the risk of graft failure with cord blood are warranted.</p><p/><p>Mixed chimerism is a risk factor for graft rejection; however, stable mixed chimerism does not adversely affect survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3334313685\" class=\"local\">'Graft failure'</a> below.)</p><p>The relationship between mixed chimerism and graft rejection is illustrated in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2008 study involved 97 consecutive patients who underwent HCT for thalassemia and had the percentage of donor and recipient hematopoietic cells assessed using STR markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Of these 97, 43 (44 percent) had evidence of early mixed chimerism, 50 (52 percent) had full donor engraftment, and four had early graft failure or died in the immediate post-transplant period. Serial analysis of STR markers documented graft rejection within the first two months in one of the 50 with full engraftment and 7 of the 43 with mixed chimerism (2 versus 16 percent). The likelihood of graft rejection correlated with the percentage of residual host cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our earlier series of 295 individuals who underwent HCT for thalassemia and were followed for at least two years found that the proportion of patients with mixed chimerism gradually declined over time following HCT, from 32 percent at two months to 13 percent at one year to 9 percent at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Graft rejection did not occur in any of the 200 individuals with full donor engraftment, whereas 33 of the 95 (35 percent) with mixed chimerism at two months eventually had graft rejection. We also saw a correlation between the percentage of residual host cells and rejection of the graft, with graft rejection in 18 of 19 who had &gt;25 percent host cells versus only 4 of 55 who had &lt;10 percent host cells (95 and 7 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>Other studies have used different cutoffs for the percent of recipient hematopoiesis but have reached similar conclusions regarding a greater likelihood of graft rejection in those with greater percentages of recipient-derived cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3334313685\"><span class=\"h3\">Graft failure</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2512631196\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of graft failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure of the donor hematopoietic cells to engraft can be primary (without any evidence that the donor cells engrafted) or can occur later, following a period of apparent engraftment and hematopoietic recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>]. The mechanism may be mediated by immunologic rejection of the graft, low stem cell inoculum, or bone marrow insult (eg, from infection or drug toxicity). Graft failure can be associated with recurrence of thalassemia or marrow aplasia, depending on the degree of marrow ablation in the recipient.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of graft failure in individuals without significant pretransplant iron overload has been estimated to be less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rates of graft failure in the setting of severe iron overload were illustrated in a 1996 series of 215 patients with class III iron overload (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67387 \">table 1</a>) who underwent HCT, which demonstrated the following rates of graft rejection at a follow-up of 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Entire cohort &ndash; 22 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age &lt;17 years, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> total dose 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age &lt;17 years, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> total dose 120 to 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> &ndash; 35 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age &ge;17 years, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> total dose 120 to 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> &ndash; 4 percent</p><p/><p>Graft rejection appears to be more of a concern in children than adults.

We are most likely to use this approach in individuals who have a complete return of thalassemia due to host hemopoietic reconstitution and do not plan a second transplant in the near future. (See <a href=\"#H527608291\" class=\"local\">'Thalassemia recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Growth factors such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may be used as a temporizing measure in individuals with cytopenias but are not used for severe graft failure with bone marrow aplasia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Second transplant</strong> &ndash; Retransplantation may be an option for individuals who have recurrence of thalassemia. If this approach is pursued, the second transplant can be delayed until the patient recovers from toxicities of the first transplant. Retransplantation is the only option for individuals with marrow aplasia, in which case it is performed urgently. (See <a href=\"#H527608291\" class=\"local\">'Thalassemia recurrence'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2028446020\" class=\"local\">'Marrow aplasia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>We do not use donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to treat graft failure in thalassemia. DLI involves administration of peripheral blood lymphocytes from the original hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor; typically, these are obtained by apheresis without growth factor stimulation. The use of DLI following transplant for thalassemia was illustrated in a series of 19 individuals who were presumed to have impending graft rejection based on an ongoing transfusion requirement, along with a low level of donor hematopoiesis (residual host cells &gt;25 percent) or a decline in donor hematopoiesis in the first two to six months after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Of these individuals, three developed full donor chimerism, nine continued to have mixed chimerism but no longer required transfusions, and seven had graft rejection. DLI therapy was generally well tolerated, with three individuals developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). While these results are encouraging, it is not clear what proportion of these individuals had their post-transplant course altered by DLI and what proportion would have had the same outcome without the procedure since many individuals have dynamic changes during the first two years <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stable mixed chimerism for long periods of time without graft failure (see <a href=\"#H1411122622\" class=\"local\">'Mixed chimerism'</a> above). The mechanism by which DLI can restore donor hematopoiesis is thought to involve an expanded donor immunologic reaction against host hematopoietic cells, similar to the graft-versus-tumor effect seen in hematologic malignancies treated with this approach.

The optimal approach is unknown; only small series have been published describing management in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25</a>]. Thus, the approach is individualized according to the ability of the original donor to provide a second donation or the availability of a different donor, and the patient's overall medical condition and ability to tolerate a second transplant. Small series of second transplants suggest that it is best to wait at least a year to allow recovery from the toxic effects of the conditioning regimen. There is no evidence to suggest any benefit from changing to a different donor or a different stem cell source.</p><p>Examples of the available observations include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2008 series reviewed outcomes of a second transplant for recurrence of thalassemia in 16 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Persistent aplasia is rare. These patients are at risk for life-threatening infections from neutropenia and bleeding from thrombocytopenia, and they require ongoing transfusional support, similar to individuals with very severe aplastic anemia.

This is mitigated by pretransplantation iron chelation, but excess iron stores are often seen, even among those receiving chelation therapy. This was illustrated in a 2017 series of 176 children and adolescents with beta thalassemia who underwent HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Despite pretransplant iron chelation in 87 percent of the patients, the median pretransplant ferritin level was 1638 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> and the median liver iron content calculated from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or liver biopsy was 4.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> dry weight or 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> dry weight, respectively.</p><p>Following successful engraftment, excess iron should be removed in order to reduce organ damage, which may exacerbate (or be exacerbated by) toxicities of the conditioning regimen, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), or medications. Phlebotomy is typically used for iron removal as long as erythropoiesis is sufficient to allow it.</p><p>We typically wait to address excess iron stores until approximately 18 months after transplant or after the patient has discontinued the calcineurin inhibitor and other transplant-related medications for approximately six months (which may be longer than 18 months after transplant in some cases). This allows the patient to recover from the procedure, develop adequate immune function, and increase their hemoglobin level as much as possible before starting phlebotomy (calcineurin inhibitors have a mild depressive effect on erythropoiesis). Earlier treatment is not usually necessary since no significant progression of liver disease has been observed when comparing liver biopsies taken at baseline and at 18 months after transplantation.</p><p>There appears to be a very good correlation between hepatic iron concentration using liver biopsy and total body iron stores, provided the liver biopsy specimen is adequate (&ge;1 mg dry weight) and cirrhosis is absent. This was illustrated in our series of 25 patients who underwent HCT for thalassemia and subsequently had determination of liver iron by biopsy and total body iron stores by serial phlebotomy, which allows determination of the number of units that can be removed before the patient becomes iron deficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This study showed a strong correlation between liver iron and total body iron, as illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55632\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55632 \">figure 1</a>), and allowed us to calculate that total body iron stores in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight are approximately equal to the hepatic iron concentration multiplied by 10.6. The correlation of liver iron with total body stores was much better than the correlation of serum ferritin with total body iron stores as long as the liver biopsy contained &ge;1 mg dry weight.</p><p>We usually assess iron stores using ultrasound-guided liver biopsy, although other experts use MRI. We prefer liver biopsy because it permits an accurate evaluation of liver iron content as well as the degree of liver fibrosis and chronic hepatitis. A 2008 expert panel from the Italian Society of Hematology evaluated the relative utility of various methods of iron quantification and concluded that MRI had a relatively good correlation with liver biopsy, whereas the consistency of results using superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) did not correlate as well; thus, liver biopsy remains the gold standard and MRI may be a reasonable alternative as long as local calibration and R2 sequences are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Adverse events were seen in five phlebotomy patients (four with difficult venous access and one with emotional distress) and two chelation patients (one with rash and one with increased liver function tests). Most of the phlebotomy patients' parents expressed a desire to switch to chelation because time off work and time spent in appointments would be reduced.

However, heart failure appears to be a rare cause of mortality (&lt;1 percent) in our experience and in other large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. After iron removal, the risk of heart disease is similar to that in individuals undergoing HCT for indications other than thalassemia.</p><p>Cardiac function must be accurately monitored during transplant. Fluid retention must be prevented. Intensive pre- or peri-transplant chelation therapy can be considered in symptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Endocrine dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with thalassemia may have endocrine dysfunction due to thalassemia-related iron overload that precedes transplant. Hypogonadism is the most common endocrine disorder in medically treated patients with thalassemia major, affecting as many as 50 percent of individuals. Impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus are also common complications of iron overload. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias#H658585977\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Endocrine and metabolic abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to endocrine dysfunction due to iron overload, these individuals may have endocrine dysfunction related to HCT. For those who do not have pretransplant iron overload and iron toxicity, the risk of endocrine dysfunction related to HCT is similar to other pediatric or adolescent patients. Those with pretransplant endocrinopathies may experience worsening and should have specific attention to these abnormalities during follow-up.</p><p>The risk of endocrine dysfunction in individuals with thalassemia was illustrated in a series involving 50 children with thalassemia who underwent HCT before puberty (mean age, 11 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Of these, 40 percent entered puberty normally despite the usual presence of clinical and hormonal evidence of hypogonadism. Despite these observations, young children transplanted in the early phase of thalassemia appear to have a good prognosis for growth and fertility. Several reports have described successful pregnancies (not requiring assisted reproductive technologies) following HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,49,50</a>]. In principle, iron-related endocrinopathies may be reversed using iron depletion after HCT, but this remains to be demonstrated.

Examples from our experience include a case of Kaposi sarcoma and an unrelated case of cancer of the lip, both in patients with chronic GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Two other cancers developed in patients without chronic GVHD (one osteochondroma and one colon cancer, 7 and 20 years after transplant, respectively).

We typically wait to assess and treat excess iron stores until approximately 18 months after transplant or after the patient has discontinued cyclosporin and other transplant-related medications for approximately six months. Phlebotomy and iron chelation therapy are both effective; their advantages and disadvantages are very different (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68353 \">table 4</a>), highlighting the need to factor in patient values and preferences in decision making. For most individuals with excess iron stores who have access to phlebotomy and can tolerate the procedure, we suggest phlebotomy rather than chelation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
