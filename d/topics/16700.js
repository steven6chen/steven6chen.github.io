Another word for swelling is &quot;edema.&quot; Some common parts of the body where people can have swelling are the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower legs or hands</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest &ndash; Swelling can occur in the lungs or in the space around the lungs.</p><p/><p>Swelling in the legs, hands, and belly can be uncomfortable and can be a symptom of a more serious condition. Swelling in the lungs can be life-threatening, because it is usually a symptom of a serious heart problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1670212825\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of swelling?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of swelling can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Puffiness of the skin, which can cause the skin to look stretched and shiny &ndash; This often occurs with swelling in the lower legs or lower back, and can be worse after people sit or stand for a long time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61706\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61706 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in belly size (with swelling of the belly)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing (with swelling in the chest)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1670212832\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the causes of swelling?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different conditions can cause swelling. Some of these include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with veins (blood vessels) in the legs &ndash; Normally, veins carry blood from the body back to the heart. But if valves in the veins do not work well, the veins cannot pump enough blood back to the heart. This can cause swelling in the lower legs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood clots &ndash; People who have a blood clot blocking a leg vein can have swelling in the feet or ankles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy &ndash; Pregnant women can have swelling in the hands, feet, or face.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monthly periods &ndash; Women can have swelling in different parts of their body before they get their period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Swelling can be a side effect of some medicines, such as medicines for diabetes, high blood pressure, or pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney problems &ndash; People who have certain kidney problems can have swelling in the lower legs or around the eyes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure &ndash; Heart failure is a type of heart problem in which the heart cannot pump normally.

If your doctor or nurse recommends that you wear them, he or she will tell you which type to wear and how to put them on (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F81922\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81922 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53659\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53659 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57705\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57705 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raising the legs up &ndash; Some people can reduce swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet by raising their legs up 3 or 4 times a day for 30 minutes each time.
