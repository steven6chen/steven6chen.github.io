This clone of plasma cells proliferates in the bone marrow and often results in extensive skeletal destruction with osteolytic lesions, osteopenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pathologic fractures. Additional disease-related complications include hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and infections. </p><p>The International Myeloma Working Group has developed uniform response criteria, which are used to measure the effect of treatment. These criteria are described in detail here. This same group has proposed definitions of survival endpoints (ie, progression-free survival, time to progression, and duration of response) to be used in reporting clinical research. These are also defined here.</p><p>The following issues related to MM are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of MM and the tests used to measure monoclonal proteins in the blood and urine.

In such patients, baseline tumor burden is measured prior to therapy using the serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), and the serum free light chain (FLC) assay. At follow up, prior to each cycle of therapy, tumor burden is measured using the SPEP and either the serum FLC assay or the UPEP. Many patients and clinicians find the serum FLC assay to be more convenient than the UPEP, although the correlation between these tests is not perfect. In patients followed preferentially with SPEP and serum FLC assay, the UPEP should still be performed periodically (eg, every six months) for validation and to check for other renal issues such as albuminuria. Serum and urine immunofixation should be done in addition, once the electrophoresis shows no measureable protein. In these patients, other methods for measuring tumor burden (eg, bone marrow biopsy, whole body <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT)</span> are reserved for the investigation of suspected complete response or progressive disease. (See <a href=\"#H1686091043\" class=\"local\">'SPEP, UPEP, and immunofixation'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>No measureable M-protein, measureable FLC</strong> &ndash; A subset of patients without measureable M-protein in serum or urine at baseline will have an involved serum FLC level &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (ie, measureable FLC). In such patients, FLC levels are used as the primary measure of tumor burden with each cycle of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1451899342\" class=\"local\">'Free light chain assay'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>No measureable M-protein or FLC</strong> &ndash; A minority of patients will have no measureable M-protein or involved immunoglobulin FLC at baseline, yet demonstrate &ge;30 percent plasma cells on bone marrow evaluation.

The frequency of bone marrow and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> assessment in these patients depends on other clinical parameters (eg, hemoglobin, calcium, and creatinine); patients who are felt to be responding well based on improvement in end-organ function will need bone marrow and imaging assessments less frequently compared with those in whom the response status is less clear.

In clinical trials, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is needed to document a complete response. Assessment of the bone marrow for minimal residual disease (MRD) using next-generation flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing is usually reserved for patients on clinical trials. In patients who are suspected to be MRD negative, a whole body <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> may be needed to document imaging MRD negative status in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In addition, imaging studies such as <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT,</span> MRI, or whole body low dose CT may be needed. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is not always necessary, but should be performed if there is doubt about the disease status, to determine if change in the cytogenetic characteristics has occurred, or to determine eligibility for clinical trials. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1686091043\"><span class=\"h3\">SPEP, UPEP, and immunofixation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The measurement of monoclonal (M) protein in the serum and urine is the preferred method to determine disease response and monitor for relapse.

In clinical practice this is reasonable, provided periodic UPEP studies are done for verification. In clinical trials, the UPEP is still needed for all patients with measurable disease. &#160;</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=daratumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Daratumumab</a> is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on SPEP and IFE assays. As such, it may obfuscate the response assessment in patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. A daratumumab-specific immunofixation electrophoresis reflex assay has been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This assay uses a murine anti-daratumumab antibody to shift the migration of daratumumab on electrophoresis to allow for differentiation between it and native IgG kappa. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1451899342\"><span class=\"h3\">Free light chain assay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum free light chain (FLC) measurement can be used to monitor tumor burden in patients without measurable M-protein in the serum and urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It also provides a more rapid way to evaluate response to treatment in patients with abnormal baseline FLC, because of its significantly shorter half-life than the monoclonal IgG or IgA. However, not all patients need FLC monitoring:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FLC levels are most informative in patients who lack measurable M-protein in the serum and urine (ie, serum M-protein &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and urine M-protein &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. FLC assays are also useful in clinical practice as an alternative to the UPEP in patients with measurable M-protein levels. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FLC levels can be used only if the following two criteria are met:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Baseline FLC ratio is abnormal (&lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Baseline level of the involved light chain isotype (kappa or lambda) is &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.

Periodic bone marrow aspirate and biopsy plays a key role in the response assessment of these patients. In order to follow disease activity, the baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage must be significant, typically &ge;30 percent. In addition, a bone marrow assessment is required for the determination of complete response.</p><p>When using bone marrow to assess response, the percentage of plasma cells is usually determined by a morphologic evaluation and visual quantitation. </p><p>The importance of including a bone marrow examination in the accurate estimation of complete response rates was perhaps best demonstrated in a study of 92 patients with previously measurable disease who had achieved negative serum and urine immunofixation following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. After evaluation of a bone marrow biopsy, 79 patients (86 percent) demonstrated less than 5 percent plasma cells, while 13 patients (14 percent) had 5 percent or greater plasma cells, 11 of whom demonstrated monoclonality. When only patients with a normal serum FLC ratio and negative immunofixation of the urine and serum were analyzed, 3 of 26 patients (10 percent) demonstrated 5 percent or greater plasma cells in the bone marrow.</p><p>While generally reserved for the research setting, quantitative assessment of minimal residual disease in the bone marrow may also be performed using next generation sequencing or next generation flow cytometry. The clinical value of these more sensitive tests is yet to be determined, but is an area of active research.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of PET in assessing treatment response during therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/2,8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8-12</a>]. &#160; </p><p>The International Myeloma Working Group response criteria defines a negative whole body <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> as the disappearance of every area of increased tracer uptake found at baseline, or on a preceding <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT;</span> or a decrease to less than the mediastinal blood pool standardized uptake value (SUV); or a decrease to less than that of surrounding normal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Studies suggest that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than PET when used for initial staging; however, MRI appears to have a higher false positive rate than PET when used for response assessment, partially due to its inability to distinguish between bone remodelling versus residual disease in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/2,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12-15</a>].

There has been increased interest in MRD measurement as the incorporation of novel agents has increased the percentage of patients achieving complete response (CR). &#160;</p><p>Two main techniques are being studied, each of which has strengths and weaknesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Next-generation flow cytometry &ndash; A method standardized by the EuroFlow consortium can be performed in a few hours using automated software that minimizes subjectivity. A baseline sample is not required, but the study must be performed on a fresh sample.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Next-generation VDJ sequencing &ndash; The method is technically difficult, can take several days, and is not widely available. A baseline sample is required to identify the dominant clonotype, but the study can be performed on both fresh and stored samples. Not impacted by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.</p><p/><p>The impact of MRD status on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed in a meta-analysis that pooled data from 21 trials, most of which incorporated transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. MRD was assessed using flow cytometry (9 trials), polymerase chain reaction (11 trials), or next-generation sequencing (1 trial). MRD negativity was associated with improved PFS (median 54 versus 26 months, HR 0.41) and OS (median 98 versus 82 months, HR 0.57). The association between MRD status and PFS and OS was maintained in a subset analysis of those who achieved CR. </p><p>However, the clinical use of MRD monitoring in patients with MM is unclear. It appears to be an excellent prognostic marker, but there are no randomized trials that have used MRD status as an integral marker for treatment decisions. Decisions on whether to continue, alter, or resume therapy cannot at present be based solely on a positive or negative signal. MRD negativity is also not indicative of cure. A subset of patients with sustained MRD negative status for a prolonged period of time may be cured, but longer follow-up of patients in clinical trials is needed to confirm this hypothesis. </p><p>As always, one must be careful when interpreting studies that show improved outcome in responders versus nonresponders (eg, iCR versus no iCR) since such comparisons have inherent methodologic flaws that cannot be overcome by increasing the sample size. In general, whether or not a treatment works, &quot;responders&quot; will typically appear to do better than &quot;nonresponders.&quot; One way of overcoming the bias that exists when comparing responders with nonresponders is to perform landmark analysis at time points that ensure that almost all patients have had time to reach the response level being studied.</p><p>In the future, the preferred test for MRD detection, optimal timing of assessment, and the best MRD threshold to use will likely vary depending on availability and the reason MRD is being measured (eg, prognostic marker, goal of therapy, indicator of cure). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPONSE CRITERIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">IMWG response categories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria are the preferred criteria to determine the patient's best response to treatment and to define when a relapse has occurred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55362 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18,19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negative &ndash; Absence aberrant clonal plasma cells by next-generation flow cytometry (NGF) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) on bone marrow aspirates with a minimum sensitivity of 1 in 10<sup>5</sup> nucleated cells or higher. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stringent complete response (sCR) &ndash; In addition to CR criteria (defined below), these patients have a normal free light chain (FLC) ratio and have no clonal cells by bone marrow immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence.

In such patients, baseline tumor burden is measured prior to therapy using the serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), and the serum free light chain (FLC) assay. At follow up, prior to each cycle of therapy, tumor burden is measured using the SPEP and either the serum FLC assay or the UPEP. In patients followed preferentially with SPEP and serum FLC assay, the UPEP should still be performed periodically (eg, every six months) for validation and to check for other renal issues such as albuminuria. Serum and urine immunofixation are used once the electrophoresis shows no measureable protein.
