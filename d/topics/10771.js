Symptoms of opioid withdrawal include drug craving, anxiety, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, diaphoresis, and tachycardia. Medications used in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms include opioid agonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> (a partial agonist), as well as alpha-2 adrenergic agonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>. </p><p>The principal purpose of supervised withdrawal is to safely and successfully transition the patient to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. Supervised withdrawal alone does not generally result in sustained abstinence from opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], nor does it address reasons the patient became dependent on opioids or the damage that the addiction has done to relationships, employment, finances, and the mental, physical, and spiritual health of the patient. </p><p>This topic describes indications and contraindications, monitoring, treatment options, and selection among them in medically supervised opioid withdrawal. Clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of opioid withdrawal are described separately. The management of unplanned withdrawal in the emergency department is also described separately, as is opioid withdrawal in adolescents.

Supervised withdrawal, however, presents a much higher risk to the mother and fetus due to the high rate of subsequent relapse (41 to 96 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Relapse to use of illicit opioids typically results in recurrent episodes of intoxication and withdrawal, with the potential for fetal growth delay, abruptio placentae, preterm labor, passage of meconium, and fetal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Lifestyle risks and poor prenatal care associated with ongoing illicit opioid use also contribute to worse maternal and fetal outcomes for women not on medication-assisted treatment compared with those who remain on medication-assisted treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Women who refuse opioid-agonist treatment or do not have it available to them would need to undergo medically supervised withdrawal.

Withdrawal is safest in the second trimester and typically uses a slow <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> taper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The severity of withdrawal and its exact symptoms do not always correlate with the daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalent dose of the previous drug or the reported duration of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>We use the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F106994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106994 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] because of its ease of use and sensitivity. The COWS rates the severity of 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> of opioid withdrawal on a scale from 0 to 5. The COWS has been well validated and shows interrater correlation coefficients as high as 0.975 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. We administer the COWS multiple times each day during supervised withdrawal. In the sections on Administration of standard medications, below, we describe specific measurement intervals and threshold COWS scores used to guide dosing decisions.

The inclusion of naloxone discourages intravenous buprenorphine abuse since the naloxone can precipitate withdrawal when administered parenterally to patients with physiologic dependence on full agonist opioids. The ratio of buprenorphine to naloxone is 4:1. More detailed information on buprenorphine&rsquo;s pharmacology and use in maintenance treatment are discussed separately.

To avoid this, the patient must be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal <strong>before</strong> taking <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> first dose of buprenorphine (for example, having a Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale [COWS] score greater than 10 to 12). When buprenorphine is administered to a patient in withdrawal, he or she experiences a net gain in opioid agonism and relief from withdrawal symptoms. The high cost of buprenorphine has led to its exclusion from some healthcare formularies. Buprenorphine can only be prescribed for opioid use disorder by clinicians in the United States who have met regulatory conditions for its use, with exceptions for emergency treatment of withdrawal.

The patient typically goes home with a second dose to be taken if needed six hours or more later and returns the next day. </p><p>A typical induction (initiating the medication), stabilization (bringing withdrawal symptoms under control), and taper typically has a duration of 5 to 10 days, though longer tapers (up to 28 days) appear to improve symptom control. The optimal taper has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

One well-controlled trial with high intensity treatment including induction onto <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a> and daily visits for 28 days, and then thrice weekly visits for the following eight weeks, did show better abstinence rates for the four-week taper versus one- or two-week tapers at the end of 12 weeks of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Induction (Day 1)</strong> &ndash; The timing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> initiation is based in part on the half-life of the prior opioid and the time of last use. A table describes dosing and half-life information for commonly used opioids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111206 \">table 1</a>). A patient dependent on a short-acting agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> would be advised to take their last dose 6 to 12 hours before coming in for initiation. A patient who has been regularly using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, a long-acting drug, would take their last dose 36 hours before treatment. For patients transitioning to supervised withdrawal from methadone maintenance treatment, patient&rsquo;s daily dose should gradually be tapered to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> before buprenorphine initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

In most cases, 4 mg is well tolerated and allows for fewer reassessments later. Relief of symptoms can occur in minutes, though often 30 to 60 minutes is needed for the full effect. Many will report reductions in COWS score to 5 or less.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the patient experiences sufficient relief after the initial 4 mg dose (COWS score less than 6), vital signs are stable, and there are no other adverse effects, the patient can go home with a second 4 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> dose, which they are instructed to take if withdrawal symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> craving becomes prominent prior to the next morning.

In contrast to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a>, methadone does not induce withdrawal symptoms when given to a patient with opioid agonist in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> system. Methadone has an additive effect on opioids that are already present. Other advantages to methadone are that clinicians are generally more familiar with its dosing compared with buprenorphine, and it is available through almost all healthcare formularies. </p><p>Disadvantages of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> include that it is not safe in overdose. United States regulations preclude providing the medication to take home except when used for pain management. For these reasons, its use in supervised withdrawal usually requires residential or inpatient treatment. Supervised withdrawal with methadone in the United States is legally restricted to a federally designated OTP, to a maximum of three days in other outpatient settings as the patient awaits admission to an OTP, or to an inpatient hospital setting. </p><p>Adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> include prolonged QTc and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Methadone should <strong>not</strong> be used if the QTc is over 500 msec and used with caution if between 450 to 500 msec. Caution should also be used in patients with an elevated risk of bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypocalcemia, as these will raise risk of QTc prolongation and with concurrent use of psychotropics or other medications that prolong QTc interval. </p><p>Overdose with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> can be lethal, due to arrhythmia or respiratory depression. Overdose is treated with 0.4 to 0.8 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>, with repeated doses as needed and rapid transfer to a medical unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Risks associated with methadone overdose are described in more detail separately. </p><p>Because of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>&rsquo;s long half-life, its dose needs to be increased cautiously on Day 1 of medically supervised withdrawal. The drug will accumulate faster than it is eliminated over a 24 hour dosing interval and can reach dangerous levels. The first dose should not exceed 30 mg, and no more than 40 mg should be given on the first day.</p><p>Acute side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> include constipation, mild drowsiness, excess sweating, peripheral edema, and erectile dysfunction. Constipation should be aggressively treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docusate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docusate</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/sennosides</span>.

There are many different approaches to the dosing of methadone substitution and taper. Here we describe our approach as well as some variations. </p><p>The duration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> taper ranges from five days for an inpatient to 14 days or longer for an outpatient. OTP programs might utilize a treatment plan involving a slower taper of 30 to 180 days (long-term detoxification). A briefer, simple paradigm is a five-day course of 25 to 20 to 15 to 10 to 5 mg over five days. We prefer a symptom-guided approach to dosing, described below: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Induction (Day 1)</strong> &ndash; In the absence of opioid withdrawal <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/signs,</span> it is difficult to gauge the efficacy of an initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> dose; thus, the first dose of methadone is not started until the patient enters mild to moderate withdrawal (a score of 10 to 12 on the COWS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F106994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106994 \">table 2</a>)).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> on Day 1 should not rely as much on the reported opioid agent and daily dose as it should seek a balance between controlling withdrawal symptoms and avoiding oversedation and motor impairment. Conversion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalents to methadone dose is difficult as the values vary based on methadone dose and previous tolerance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> dose on Day 1 can vary from 10 to a maximum of 20 mg, and the dose over the first 24 hours must not exceed 40 mg. Considerations in choosing an initial methadone dose include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A typical initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> dose is 20 mg. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One could start with 10 mg in a patient who presents with a history of low daily opioid use, such as one to two bags of heroin per day or 5 to 10 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A more incremental approach requiring closer monitoring is to start with a 10 mg dose irrespective of opioid use history, and reassess COWS after two hours. If COWS is:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Less than 6, observe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>6 to 12 give a 5 mg dose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>12 or over, give a 10 mg dose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">After a second dose, reassess COWS after another two hours, and repeat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stabilization</strong> &ndash; On the morning of Day 2, if COWS is under 6, the total dose used over the first 24 hours should be provided on Day 2. A daily dose of 40 mg or less will control symptoms in most patients. If COWS remains between 6 to 12 on Day 2, the total Day 2 dose might be raised by 20 percent (up to 40 mg). If after two hours this does not bring COWS below 6, additional adjunctive treatment as described below may be needed. (See <a href=\"#H1266885965\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive medications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If COWS on Day 2 is over 12, or there are other indications that withdrawal symptoms cannot be controlled, a period of maintenance treatment can be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Taper</strong> &ndash; Dose taper can typically be started after Day 2. Dose reduction can be as rapid as 20 percent per day on an inpatient unit, but tapers of one to two weeks or longer are the norm.

Anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, must be recognized and adequately addressed to facilitate completion of supervised withdrawal. The risk of suicide is elevated in anxiety and mood disorders and must be constantly assessed during the course of detoxification. Trauma-based conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, may adversely affect the patient's ability to tolerate residential or inpatient environments. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> levels can vary markedly with withdrawal-associated dehydration and must be monitored closely. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Carbamazepine</a> may increase <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> dosing needs, and psychotropics strongly interacting with the CYP2D6 and 3A4 systems may affect levels of methadone and, to a lesser extent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a>.

Its principal purpose is to safely and successfully transition the patient to subsequent, continuing treatment to maintain abstinence from opioids. (See <a href=\"#H292407430\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A structured instrument with a standardized scoring system should be used in conjunction with clinical observation to assess the progress and severity of withdrawal, and guide medication administration. We use the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F106994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106994 \">table 2</a>) because of its ease of use and sensitivity. What is most important is that staff become familiar with one tool and use it consistently and reliability. (See <a href=\"#H2994592020\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with physiologic dependence on opioids undergoing medically supervised withdrawal, we suggest first-line treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-and-naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine-naloxone</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> or an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> is unavailable or unfamiliar, methadone is a reasonable alternative, provided that the patient is in a closely monitored inpatient or residential setting that can minimize risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">overdose/diversion</span> and the patient lacks cardiac or other contraindications to its use. (See <a href=\"#H1580867044\" class=\"local\">'Buprenorphine/naloxone'</a> above and <a href=\"#H124135945\" class=\"local\">'Methadone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in settings that prohibit use of controlled substances including opioid agonists (eg, drug-free residential programs, prisons), we suggest use of an alpha-2 adrenergic medication such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> for supervised withdrawal compared with no pharmacologic treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2006857508\" class=\"local\">'Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We agree with the with the recommendation of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that pregnant women with opioid use disorder start or continue medication-assisted treatment with an opioid agonist during pregnancy rather than undergo medically supervised withdrawal and attempt to maintain abstinence. Some women may refuse opioid-agonist maintenance treatment in favor of medically supervised withdrawal. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> during pregnancy is discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2147626708\" class=\"local\">'Ultra-rapid or anesthesia assisted withdrawal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom-specific, adjunctive medications (also known as symptomatic treatment) are used to provide targeted relief of withdrawal symptoms (eg, cramping, diarrhea, nausea) that occur despite primary-medication treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F106793\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106793 \">table 3</a>). There are several options for each symptom type. Our first-line preferences are noted on the table; staff often come to prefer one or two drugs with which they have become most familiar.
