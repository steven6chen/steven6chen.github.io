These defects can be caused by genetic abnormalities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> environmental exposures, although the underlying etiology is often unknown. Birth defects can be isolated or present in a characteristic combination or pattern that may affect one or more organ systems.</p><p>Evaluation of a child with a birth defect includes a comprehensive history and physical examination. This is followed by further testing, as indicated. A general approach to evaluation is presented here. More detailed descriptions are included in the topic reviews of specific disorders. The types, patterns, and causes of birth defects are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Epidemiology, types, and patterns&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4022715672\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL FOR INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Referral to a genetic specialist is suggested for any child that presents with a single major birth defect or a combination of multiple birth defects, whether those are major or minor, since the risk for having a syndrome increases with the number of defects and some syndromes have a genetic etiology. In addition, any family history of a specific birth defect(s) or history of miscarriages <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stillbirths should prompt referral to a geneticist. Other referrals may include plastic surgery for limb anomalies (polydactyly, syndactyly) or for craniosynostoses, orthopedics for clubfoot deformities, ophthalmology for microphthalmia, and neurology for microcephaly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prenatal history may uncover specific exposures and etiologic factors. This should include medical and obstetric history, such as the duration of gestation, prenatal care, and maternal exposures (eg, alcohol, prescribed or illicit drugs, cigarettes, fevers, illnesses, chemicals, radiation). A history of stillbirths and miscarriages could be related to a balanced chromosomal rearrangement in one of the parents. Results of noninvasive and invasive prenatal testing, including ultrasound examinations, should be obtained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-the-newborn-infant#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of the newborn infant&quot;, section on 'History'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Causes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-prenatal-ultrasonography-as-a-screening-tool\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine prenatal ultrasonography as a screening tool&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A complete family history and pedigree (four generations, if possible) should be obtained to help uncover genetic causes. The age of the parents is important because the incidence of chromosome aneuploidies is increased in older mothers and de novo autosomal dominant mutations (eg, achondroplasia, neurofibromatosis type 1) are more commonly seen with older parents, with the effect being more marked for advanced paternal age. The parents should be asked about consanguinity, which increases the incidence of autosomal recessive disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytogenetic abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Numeric abnormalities'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achondroplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achondroplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Determining ethnic origin may be helpful because some diseases are more prevalent in certain ethnic groups. As an example, postaxial polydactyly is more frequent in people of African descent and has a prevalence of 1.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This birth defect can result from an autosomal dominant trait. A careful family history should be obtained when evaluating a child with polydactyly, particularly if African American, since penetrance for this trait can be incomplete.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough physical examination should be performed. In addition to standard measurements of weight, length, and head circumference, measurements of specific structures may be helpful. These can be compared with standard measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-the-newborn-infant#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of the newborn infant&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: General principles and standard measurements&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: General principles and standard measurements&quot;, section on 'Standard measurements'</a>.)</p><p>The standard measurements used in clinical genetics include the commonly used head circumference (occipital frontal circumference), <span class=\"nowrap\">height/length,</span> and weight. Arm span and lower <span class=\"nowrap\">segment/upper</span> segment are often obtained in children with short stature <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suspected skeletal dysplasias and are also used for assessment of connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-dysplasias-approach-to-evaluation#H4006987367\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal dysplasias: Approach to evaluation&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Measurements of craniofacial structures can be valuable to confirm suspected clinical findings and help delineation of syndromes. These are often performed by clinical geneticists and can be useful in the same way growth charts are for the pediatrician. In addition, to confirm findings, measurements are done when there is uncertainty about a clinical diagnostic decision. These measurements include ear length, inner canthal distance, outer canthal distance, interpupillary distance, palpebral fissures length, and philtrum length (extends from the nasal septum to the upper vermilion border). Other frequently used measurements include length of hands, feet, and digits to look for brachydactyly or arachnodactyly.</p><p>In newborns and fetuses, the placenta and umbilical cord should also be examined. Two-vessel cord is associated with congenital heart defects. Intrauterine growth retardation can result from a pathologic placenta (chromosomal mosaicism in the placenta, vascular abnormalities like thrombi or infarction) that interferes with growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-the-newborn-infant#H38\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of the newborn infant&quot;, section on 'Umbilical cord'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-general-principles-and-standard-measurements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: General principles and standard measurements&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gross-examination-of-the-placenta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gross examination of the placenta&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examination of family members may assist with the evaluation of some abnormalities. One example is the child with holoprosencephaly. One of the parents may have a single incisor or hypotelorism, representing a mild manifestation of the same disorder. Another example is Treacher-Collins syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder in which a parent can have minimal microtia or mild underdevelopment of malar facial structures that may have been missed on previous examinations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Facial clefts and holoprosencephaly&quot;, section on 'Holoprosencephaly'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes with craniofacial abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Treacher Collins syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>The physical exam is a powerful tool for the geneticist and pediatrician.

Testing is performed for specific infectious agents (eg, TORCH infections [toxoplasmosis, other, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus], Zika virus) or maternal autoimmune disorders, for example, if findings suggest one of these causes. Diagnostic genetic testing is performed if a specific genetic defect is suspected based upon the initial evaluation. A broader genetic screening tool is used if no specific diagnoses are identified with the history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4094497138\"><span class=\"h2\">When to order laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory studies are guided by the clinical presentation. The majority of children that present with a single or multiple birth defects are studied first for the presence of chromosome abnormalities. Specialized testing is performed if a neurologic presentation includes hypotonia or suspicion of visceromegaly (eg, peroxisomal studies for Zellweger syndrome, serum cholesterol precursors for Smith-Lemli-Opitz, organic acids in urine for glutaric acidemia type I). Exome sequencing has aided significantly in the identification of rare single gene disorders. Exome sequencing should be used in cases with multiple congenital anomalies with or without intellectual disabilities where there is no identified genetic defect, as well as for many other complex presentations of congenital disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1330257294\"><span class=\"h2\">Chromosome studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molecular-based chromosome microarray studies (array comparative genomic hybridization [aCGH]) are widely used to diagnose conditions that are difficult to recognize clinically <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cytogenetically (eg, microdeletions of the short arm of chromosome 16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] or microdeletions of 22q11.2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]). aCGH is the first line of testing in children with multiple anomalies and intellectual disabilities and has displaced the use of conventional cytogenetic studies such as Giemsa banding karyotype (G-banding) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies. aCGH is preferred because it can identify small chromosome abnormalities that cannot be detected by traditional chromosome studies such as G-banding (eg, duplications of the 22q11.2 critical region for velocardiofacial syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]) and does not require a presumptive clinical diagnosis and prior knowledge of which specific chromosomal region to examine, as is needed with the older, molecular-based techniques such as FISH. Use of aCGH has increased the detection yield to 12 to 15 percent compared with conventional chromosome studies that have a detection yield of approximately 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].

Traditional chromosome studies are often performed as a second-tier evaluation when an abnormality is detected by aCGH but the specific cause cannot be determined. As an example, aCGH can identify a loss or gain of material. However, it cannot identify the specific cause in the case of gain of material. These causes include a duplication of a chromosome region, a translocation, an insertion of an extra chromosome piece in a different chromosome, or a marker chromosome (a structurally abnormal chromosome that essentially results in a partial trisomy).</p><p>Indications for aCGH include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more major anomalies (eg, congenital heart disease)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three or more minor anomalies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained intellectual disability with or without dysmorphic features or other anomalies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained growth retardation or failure to thrive (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-undernutrition-in-children-younger-than-two-years-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive (undernutrition) in children younger than two years: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any congenital anomaly and a family history of birth defects <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multiple miscarriages</p><p/><p>Some arrays used in clinical medicine include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

WES analyzes the exons or coding regions of approximately 19,000 to 20,000 genes simultaneously using next-generation sequencing techniques. This test is extremely valuable for uncovering changes in Mendelian genes (single genes) responsible for medical disorders. By sequencing the exome of a patient and comparing it with the normal reference sequence, variations in an individual's DNA sequence can be identified and related back to the individual's medical concerns in an effort to discover the cause of the medical disorder.</p><p>The analysis and interpretation of WES are rapidly improving. Several factors have played a role in the rapid evolution of WES and the changing capacities of this genetic technology. The ability to identify variants of clinical significance depends upon two modifying variables: the current state of the art of the sequencing technology used as far as the depth of the sequencing (the number of times a region is repetitively sequenced to assure the entire region is examined) and the robustness of the &quot;standard reference.&quot; As an example, WES detected causative mutations in 25 to 27 percent of children with complex malformations and <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe developmental disorders in two initial studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. A WES reanalysis of the second study of 1133 children with severe undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> congenital anomalies, dysmorphic features, abnormal growth, or unusual behavioral phenotypes using improved data and methodologies identified additional causal monogenic defects in a further 182 individuals, bringing the overall diagnostic yield to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. By comparison, in a study of WES in 278 infants in the intensive care unit (ICU) with congenital anomalies, hypotonia, seizures, abnormal growth, feeding difficulties, respiratory failure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metabolic acidosis, a molecular diagnosis was identified in 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In this study, 32 out of 63 cases were correctly diagnosed using trio WES (patient and parents sequencing at the same time) with a 51 percent yield. In 52 to 72 percent of the cases, depending upon the group selected, the care was redirected secondary to the diagnosis.</p><p>An underlying genetic mutation is still possible, even if nothing is detected on WES, because pathogenic variants may be present in regulatory regions that are outside of the coding regions. Those types of mutations can be detected on whole genome sequencing (WGS), but WGS is a more costly screening tool that has its own limitations. WES is also not suitable for the detection of microdeletions or microduplications that can be detected by chromosome microarrays and cannot detect triple repeat expansions, as is seen with fragile X syndrome or myotonic dystrophy. In addition, WES cannot detect deep intronic mutations and regulatory mutations that can be picked up by WGS.

As examples, brain MRI or CT scans are indicated in children with microcephaly, macrocephaly, holoprosencephaly, seizures, or developmental regression. MRI is best suited to examining brain structures to determine myelination, white matter development, structural anomalies, and migration defects. Head CT scans can be useful for craniosynostosis where enhanced viewing with bone windows can accurately determine premature suture fusion or closing. Radiographs of the entire body, also known as skeletal surveys, are indicated when limb anomalies are present or dwarfism is suspected due to prenatal or postnatal growth restriction. If an infant dies, postmortem pathology studies can be extremely important to establish a diagnosis and provide appropriate counseling.

These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

These defects can be caused by genetic abnormalities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> environmental exposures (teratogens), although the underlying etiology is often unknown. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific terms are used to describe congenital anomalies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57394 \">table 1</a>). In addition, multiple malformations are often grouped in a recognizable pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75281\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75281 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns#H4260699423\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Epidemiology, types, and patterns&quot;, section on 'Types and patterns of defects'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of a child with a birth defect includes a comprehensive history and physical examination. This is followed by further testing, as indicated. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prenatal history may uncover specific exposures and etiologic factors. A complete family history (including parental age and consanguinity) and pedigree (four generations, if possible) should be obtained to help uncover genetic causes. Determining ethnic origin may be helpful because some diseases are more prevalent in certain ethnic groups. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough physical examination should be performed. In addition to standard measurements of weight, length, and head circumference, measurements of specific structures may be helpful depending upon the presenting features. The patient is also examined for dysmorphic features. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evaluation depends in part upon the results of the history and physical examination. Testing is performed for specific infectious agents (eg, TORCH infections [toxoplasmosis, other, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus], Zika virus) or maternal autoimmune disorders, for example, if findings suggest one of these causes. Diagnostic genetic testing is performed if a specific genetic defect is suspected based upon the initial evaluation. A broader genetic screening tool (array comparative genomic hybridization [aCGH]) is used if no specific diagnoses are identified with the history and physical examination.
