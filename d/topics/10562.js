This approach results in more rapid recovery, which has significantly reduced the duration of antibiotic therapy, the degree of mucositis, the length of hospitalization, and the risk of the transplant procedure itself. These positive developments have resulted in a marked decline in the discomfort that patients experience in the transplant setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of stem and progenitor cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood).

This syndrome is described as post-transplant TMA or transplant-associated microangiopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipient-in-the-immediate-post-transplant-period/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>TMA may occur following allogeneic or autologous HCT, although the latter is much rarer. The cause may be multifactorial and include effects of radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy, disseminated infection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> administration of a calcineurin inhibitor for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prevention. Affected patients usually present with the gradual onset of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (eg, Coombs-negative anemia with schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear, increased lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] and decreased serum haptoglobin); thrombocytopenia; elevated serum creatinine; and a bland urinalysis (eg, normal, or with mild proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematuria).</p><p>Diagnosis of post-transplant TMA is made clinically, based on relevant patient history and clinical findings. The evaluation should include review of medications, assessment for systemic infection (eg, sepsis from the central venous catheter), and laboratory testing to exclude disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and other causes of renal insufficiency. Further details are presented separately.

Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract with acute GVHD varies widely, and is characterized by diarrhea and abdominal cramping. The diarrhea may initially be watery with high volumes. The diarrhea frequently becomes bloody, resulting in significant transfusion requirements. While the diagnosis can often be made on clinical grounds, histologic confirmation may be helpful to corroborate a clinical impression of acute GVHD. The diagnosis and management of acute GVHD is discussed in more detail separately.

Common causes of infectious diarrhea in this setting include clostridium difficile, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and many enteric viruses (eg, coxsackie, echovirus, rotavirus, norovirus). Parasitic infections, such as giardiasis, are less common, possibly due to the strict hygienic practices employed by transplant centers. Infections following HCT are discussed in more detail separately.

An initial retrospective case series of 104 patients who underwent UCB transplantation at a single institution described the occurrence of cord colitis syndrome in approximately 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipient-in-the-immediate-post-transplant-period/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients with cord colitis most commonly presented with a persistent (&gt;7 days) watery, nonbloody diarrhea starting a median of 131 days after HCT. The diarrhea was associated with weight loss (91 percent) and fever (64 percent), and the majority of patients required hospitalization. As with other forms of colitis, computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated focal or diffuse thickening of the colonic wall. Colonoscopy revealed erythematous mucosa with or without ulcerations, but no pseudomembranes. Cord colitis was distinguished from other causes of diarrhea by negative viral and bacterial cultures and a colon biopsy that demonstrated chronic active colitis, frequently with associated granulomas. All cases demonstrated a response to antibacterial treatment (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> with or without a fluoroquinolone) with a median treatment duration of 14 days. While approximately half of the patients relapsed after the discontinuation of antibiotics, all responded to subsequent courses of antibiotics.</p><p>A newly discovered bacterium, provisionally called Bradyrhizobium enterica, has been proposed as the underlying cause of cord colitis syndrome. In one study, shotgun DNA sequencing was performed on four paraffin-embedded colon biopsy specimens obtained from two patients with cord colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipient-in-the-immediate-post-transplant-period/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Nonhuman DNA sequences were identified and assembled into a nearly complete genome that was similar to, but different from, that of Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The new bacterium was named Bradyrhizobium enterica. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies detected sequences from this new genome in samples from three additional patients with cord colitis and in no samples from healthy controls or patients with graft-versus-host disease.

As an example, in patients with intermediate or advanced disease receiving a transplant from an unrelated donor (actual one-year mortality 44 to 67 percent), physician expectations were appropriately modified (estimated mortality of 38 to 55 percent), while those of patients were overly optimistic (15 to 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipient-in-the-immediate-post-transplant-period/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H599718\"><span class=\"h2\">End-of-life and advance care planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the high probability for morbidity and mortality post-transplant, advance care planning (ie, having a living will, a power of attorney for health care, or life-support instructions) should be completed while the patient is competent, to insure that care is consistent with the patient's wishes.

Mucositis remains an important clinical problem. Current management approaches include the use of topical and intravenous pain medications. In addition, growth factors may be of benefit in a subset of patients. (See <a href=\"#H598154\" class=\"local\">'Mucositis and nutritional support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disordered liver function is a common complication of both myeloablative and to a lesser extent nonmyeloablative HCT, ranging from increased concentrations of bilirubin and hepatic enzymes to hepatic graft-versus-host disease, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, and death due to liver failure. (See <a href=\"#H598219\" class=\"local\">'Hepatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who undergo HCT are at risk for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, the time course of which varies in the post-transplant period, according to the degree of immune deficiency and cytopenia induced by the transplantation procedure, as well as whether the transplantation is autologous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64491\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64491 \">figure 1</a>) or allogeneic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52716 \">figure 2</a>).

The majority of patients who have successfully undergone autologous or allogeneic HCT return to some aspects of a normal lifestyle. (See <a href=\"#H599675\" class=\"local\">'Neuro-psychiatric morbidity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of risk scores are available for estimating mortality risk in patients considering allogeneic HCT. (See <a href=\"#H599725\" class=\"local\">'Estimating mortality risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) is an ominous clinical event post-HCT and is associated with increased mortality as well as worsened long-term survival for those successfully discharged from an ICU.
