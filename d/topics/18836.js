There is no known effective treatment for rabies, and the vast majority of cases are fatal. Survival remains a rare and largely inexplicable phenomenon, which is often associated with severe neurologic sequelae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F113372\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113372 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Although the prognosis is poor in patients who develop rabies, the disease is usually preventable with proper wound care and post-exposure prophylaxis, which was first pioneered by Louis Pasteur in 1885. This topic will discuss when to use rabies prophylaxis. Additional information on rabies biologics (vaccine and immunoglobulin), as well as the epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment of human rabies, are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rabies immune globulin and vaccine&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rabies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-rabies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of rabies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to initiate rabies post-exposure prophylaxis after a potential exposure should be made following a thorough risk assessment. Post-exposure prophylaxis includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies immune globulin</a>. The specific regimen depends upon the patient's prior rabies vaccine history. A detailed discussion of the regimens used for post-exposure prophylaxis is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rabies immune globulin and vaccine&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2536846147\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To prevent rabies infection, post-exposure prophylaxis should be administered to all patients who have had a known or likely exposure to rabies. This includes patients who received pre-exposure prophylaxis; however, such patients do not require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies immune globulin</a>, and the number of required rabies vaccines after the exposure is reduced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine#H122975002\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rabies immune globulin and vaccine&quot;, section on 'Regimens for pre-exposure prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>In general, we consider an exposure to be: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bite or scratch from an animal with rabies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An open wound or mucous membrane exposure to saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, or central nervous system (CNS) tissue from an animal with rabies</p><p/><p>However, it is not always possible to confirm an exposure to rabies, and prophylaxis is often administered empirically based upon the likelihood that an exposure occurred. </p><p>Exposure of normal, keratinized skin to potentially infectious material (ie, saliva, neural tissue), or any contact with blood, urine, feces (guano), or skunk spray of a rabid animal does <strong>not</strong> constitute an exposure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2468144693\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a potential exposure to rabies it is important to decide if rabies post-exposure prophylaxis should be administered. Consultation with the local public health agency can be valuable in assessing the risk of transmission after a potential exposure. </p><p>One prospective study of university-affiliated, urban emergency departments suggested that post-exposure prophylaxis was given inappropriately in approximately 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Another report described a school incident in which a parent showed a dead bat to multiple students, some of whom touched the carcass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The bat was later tested for rabies virus, and it was confirmed to be positive. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assisted in public health recommendations for post-exposure prophylaxis after interviewing 107 students with potential exposures, but only recommended prophylaxis for one person who reported putting her finger in the mouth of the bat. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3619165334\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors need to be considered when deciding if post-exposure prophylaxis is needed after a potential exposure to rabies. These include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The epidemiology of animal rabies in the region. (See <a href=\"#H2025358727\" class=\"local\">'Animal exposures in the Unites States'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2838556241\" class=\"local\">'Animal exposures that occur outside the United States'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The species of the exposing animal.

These are discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H2875337928\" class=\"local\">'Additional considerations'</a> below.)</p><p>Almost all cases of rabies are transmitted from rabid animals through a bite. The risk of acquisition increases with multiple bites, and with bites in close proximity to the CNS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50558\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50558 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a study from Thailand, the risk of dying from rabies in patients who did not receive post-exposure prophylaxis was highest in those who were severely bitten around the face, neck, and arms, compared with those who were bitten around the feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Children are also at greater risk, presumably because of their size (ie, their entire body is close to the CNS).</p><p>In rare cases, rabies has resulted from a non-bite exposure, such as a scratch or mucous membrane that has been in contact with saliva or neural tissue from an animal with rabies. There have also been cases of rabies that have occurred after transplantation of cornea, or an organ from a human donor with unrecognized rabies. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Transplant recipients'</a> below.)</p><p>No transmission of rabies has been documented from rabies-infected patients to health care providers or household contacts; although, there is limited surveillance in parts of the world with the greatest number of human rabies cases. In addition, rabies is not transmitted via fomites or environmental surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>]. The rabies virus does not survive well outside of the host and is affected by desiccation, sunlight, pH, and other environmental factors. In general, if the material containing the virus is dry, it can be considered noninfectious.</p><p>Probable aerosol exposure to rabies virus in laboratories resulted in two cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Two other cases were attributed to possible airborne exposures in caves containing millions of free-tailed bats (<em>Tadarida brasiliensis</em>) in the southwestern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, it is difficult to rule out unapparent bites as the route of transmission given the conditions in these caves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2875337928\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When assessing the risk of an exposure it is important to evaluate factors that may indicate an exposing animal is likely to be rabid. These include absence of an appropriate vaccination history, a report by the victim of an unprovoked attack, a report that the animal was displaying neurologic signs, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a recent history of bites or wounds on the animal. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3559657931\"><span class=\"h4\">Provoked versus unprovoked exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because rabies virus infection can manifest as an increase in aggressive behavior, an unprovoked attack by an animal could represent the first sign that it is rabid. Determining if an attack is provoked or unprovoked should always be done from the point of view of the animal rather than the human. For example, bites that occur when a person is trying to handle or feed an animal should usually be considered provoked attacks. Local public health authorities can assist in making this determination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440113218\"><span class=\"h4\">Vaccination status of domestic animals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Domestic animals should receive rabies vaccination; rabies in vaccinated animals is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In sub-Saharan African (where most rabies exposures occur through rabid dogs), a cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that annual canine rabies vaccination campaigns, compared with no canine vaccination, would be cost effective and lifesaving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Despite this, a few cases of rabies have been reported in animals that have previously been vaccinated, and guidelines even continue to recommend observation of vaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets after an exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3413483604\" class=\"local\">'Domestic animals'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H802809027\"><span class=\"h4\">Animal observation and testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, decisions about prophylaxis can often be delayed if the animal is a healthy dog, cat, or ferret and is able to be confined and observed for 10 days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71322\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71322 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>Data from rabies pathogenesis studies in dogs, cats, and ferrets indicate that these animals uniformly begin to sicken and die within 10 days (usually five to seven days) after the rabies has spread from the CNS to the salivary glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animals that exhibit any sign of illness should be evaluated by a veterinarian and reported to the local health department. If the animal does develop signs of rabies, it should be euthanized and its head shipped overnight under refrigeration to a laboratory certified to perform rabies testing (most often a public health laboratory). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the animal remains healthy for the full 10 days, then it did not have rabies virus in its saliva at the time of exposure. The shedding period (ie, the time during which virus might be found in the saliva prior to an animal's death), is not fully documented for species other than dogs, cats, or ferrets.</p><p/><p>Immediate prophylaxis is indicated if the animal develops clinical signs of rabies during the 10-day observation period following the exposures. If post-exposure prophylaxis was initiated, and the animal remains well for the full 10 days or is tested for rabies and is found negative, prophylaxis can be discontinued.</p><p>The approach to prophylaxis for bats and wild terrestrial mammals who are available for testing is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H913747743\" class=\"local\">'Bat exposures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1359854670\" class=\"local\">'Wild terrestrial mammals'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H563458081\"><span class=\"h2\">When to administer prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to post-exposure prophylaxis described below is based upon the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for rabies post exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71322\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71322 \">algorithm 1</a>). Other guidelines panels, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), have also made recommendations on the use of post-exposure prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Compared with United States guidelines, the WHO recommends <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> only in select settings. The WHO guidelines are discussed in greater detail below. (See <a href=\"#H3141902199\" class=\"local\">'Special considerations in resource-limited settings'</a> below.)</p><p>In many scenarios, the decision to initiate post-exposure can be complex. Clinicians should seek the help of local or state public health authorities for further advice regarding the need for post-exposure prophylaxis. In the United States, contacts can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/contacts.html&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLP34avy7K48jfK0PvxCnCh3r9Biz1uu56+Yn0IY7HtcwZl6JErfqwi8KMF/rvK5VwQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=8328\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC website</a>.

In the United States, bat rabies is found in all 49 of the continental United States. Between 1990 and 2016, 48 of the 52 human cases of rabies acquired in the United States were due to rabies acquired from bats. </p><p>Post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered when there has been a potential contact between a human and a bat. This includes individuals who have been in a room with a bat if they are unable to rule out any physical contact. Our approach to post-exposure prophylaxis is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the bat is available for testing, prophylaxis can be delayed if the results will be available promptly (eg, several days), since more than 90 percent of bats submitted for testing are negative for rabies. Bats should not be picked up or handled by anyone except trained and vaccinated persons, unless the layperson can safely capture and confine the bat. A video demonstration of how to safely capture a bat is available on the <a href=\"http://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/zoonoses/rabies/&amp;token=3i3o1IeeCPsxCOFO9TAjzXlIiH86Oo06LwfefRuk3/mEKpRgzN/7Qm8XSEzCMC/J9u2SgC+opNjehWpqvJEhqI+L6PLCtGHQJWrIyv5yHao=&amp;TOPIC_ID=8328\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">New York State Department of Health website</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If testing is not available or if the bat tests positive for rabies, post-exposure prophylaxis should be administered in the following settings:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To all individuals who have had a bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposure from a bat. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When direct contact with a bat occurred and the individual is unable to rule out<strong> </strong>a bite or scratch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If an individual has been in a room with a bat and is unable to rule out any physical contact. Such individuals include: a sleeping person who awakens to find a bat in the room; an unattended child; a mentally disabled person; an intoxicated person. This approach is consistent with the recommendations of the ACIP for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>]; however, some guideline panels do not advocate this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-exposure prophylaxis is <strong>not</strong> necessary if the person was aware of the bat at all times while in an enclosed or open space and is certain that there was no bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposure. Household members who were not in a room with the bat do not require post-exposure prophylaxis. A clustering of human cases associated with bat exposures has never been reported (eg, within the same household or among campers at an outside camp).</p><p/><p>The risk for rabies resulting from an encounter with a bat is often difficult to assess because bites by bats may be too small to be routinely detected or may occur at night during sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50558\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50558 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. From 1990 to 2007, a total of 34 naturally acquired bat-associated human cases of rabies were reported. In 15 cases, physical contact was reported but no bite was documented, and in 11 cases, no known bat encounter was reported at all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, by the time rabies is diagnosed, getting an accurate history is usually precluded.</p><p>However, in a study that evaluated this approach by estimating bedroom exposure to bats in a population survey of 14,453 households, the number of individuals who would need to be treated to prevent a single case of bat rabies related to bedroom exposure without recognized contact ranged from 314,000 to 2.7 million persons, at a cost of 228 million to 2 billion US dollars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In this study, the incidence of rabies was based on reported cases in the United States and Canada over a 17-year period. Given these findings, the recommendations in Canada changed in 2009 so that prophylaxis is only recommended if there is both direct contact with a bat and a bite, scratch, or saliva exposure into a wound or mucous membrane cannot be ruled out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2025358727\"><span class=\"h3\">Animal exposures in the Unites States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When deciding if a specific animal exposure is likely to transmit rabies, it is important to take into account the type of animal, and the location where the exposure occurred. As an example, in developing countries, dogs continue to account for 90 percent or more of reported cases in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. By contrast, bat variant rabies viruses have emerged as the dominant source associated with indigenously acquired human rabies in the United States; other animal reservoirs include raccoons, skunks, and foxes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>The approach to rabies post-exposure prophylaxis after a bite or a mucosal exposure to a mammal in the United States is described in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71322\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71322 \">algorithm 1</a>) and is summarized below:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3413483604\"><span class=\"h4\">Domestic animals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After an exposure to a domestic animal (dog, cat, or ferret) in the United States, the decision to initiate post-exposure prophylaxis can typically be delayed if the animal is healthy and can be quarantined for 10 days of observation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71322\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71322 \">algorithm 1</a>). This approach should be used even if the animal is vaccinated. (See <a href=\"#H802809027\" class=\"local\">'Animal observation and testing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H440113218\" class=\"local\">'Vaccination status of domestic animals'</a> above.)</p><p>If these conditions cannot be met, providers should contact public health authorities to determine the need for post-exposure prophylaxis. The probability of human exposure to rabies by a domestic animal in the United States is low as the number of rabies cases among domestic animals, such as dogs or cats, has declined markedly in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, rabid dogs and cats are sporadically reported from areas with enzootic wildlife rabies. In addition, domestic animals that are incubating rabies have been imported from regions of the world where canine rabies is still enzootic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>More cats than dogs are currently reported rabid in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This is related to fewer cat vaccination laws, which results in a smaller percentage of cats vaccinated against rabies compared with dogs. Cats are also more often allowed to be free roaming than dogs and are therefore more likely to encounter rabid wildlife.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1359854670\"><span class=\"h4\">Wild terrestrial mammals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, terrestrial carnivores, such as raccoons, skunks, and foxes, are the animals most likely to be infected with rabies, after bats (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77282\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77282 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Rabies has also been reported in large rodents (woodchucks and beavers) in areas of the United States where raccoon rabies is prevalent.</p><p>Direct human and domestic animal contact with wild terrestrial mammals should be avoided. However, if an exposure does occur, we use the following approach to determine if post-exposure prophylaxis is needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71322\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71322 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raccoons, foxes, and skunks should be regarded as rabid until proven otherwise. Larger carnivores, such as coyotes, bobcats, mountain lions, wolves, bears, woodchucks, and beavers, should also be considered rabid (unless proven otherwise) <strong>if</strong> they are involved in an unprovoked attack on a person. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Post-exposure prophylaxis should be initiated immediately in response to any severe exposure (eg, multiple bites or a bite on the head, neck, or trunk) from an animal likely to be rabid. If the animal can be safely captured by someone who is trained and vaccinated, it should be euthanized and tested as soon as possible. The vaccination series may be discontinued if the animal tests negative for rabies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the type of exposure to one of these animals is of lower risk (eg, minimal bite wound to extremity, non-bite exposure), post-exposure prophylaxis can delayed temporarily if the animal can be tested promptly (eg, a few days). (See <a href=\"#H802809027\" class=\"local\">'Animal observation and testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-exposure prophylaxis for bites involving small, wild rodents, such as squirrels, chipmunks, rats, hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, mice, and lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), is generally not indicated. There has never been a case of transmission to a human from one of these animals, and these animals are likely to die from the exposing incident rather than survive to develop rabies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the need for post-exposure prophylaxis in this setting should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with public health authorities if possible. Rabies has been identified in pet rabbits and guinea pigs caged outdoors (caging may sufficiently protect them from severe injury or death during encounters with infected wildlife) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and this must be considered when evaluating the risk of rabies transmission from lagomorph and rodent bites.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H312152340\"><span class=\"h4\">Livestock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No human cases of rabies following exposure to livestock have been documented in the United States.

In such settings, observation without prophylaxis is reasonable if the biting animal is a healthy dog or cat that has previously been vaccinated against rabies, is reliably reported not to have any possible exposures to rabies in the last six months, and is readily accessible for monitoring for the 10-day period. These situations are highly variable, and the risk of rabies from a dog bite varies even within an endemic country. In general, patients should be managed in consultation with the local or state health department. </p><p>Among 38 cases of human rabies diagnosed in the United States between 2003 and 2016, nine were attributed to exposure to dogs outside the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].
