Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause genital herpes, and infection of the same anatomic site by both HSV-1 and HSV-2 has been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, genital HSV is frequently under-recognized because infection is often subclinical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Most cases of recurrent genital herpes are caused by HSV-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. From 2005 to 2010, the seroprevalence of HSV-2 in the United States was approximately 16 percent among patients aged 14 to 49 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].&nbsp;In one study that evaluated 7293 patients in this age group, the seroprevalence increased with age and number of sexual partners, and was greater among women compared with men (21 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. HSV-2 seroprevalence was also three times greater among non-Hispanic blacks (39 percent) than among non-Hispanic whites (12 percent). Similar risk factors for HSV-2 positivity have been noted in other surveys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/3,9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9-13</a>]. Prior HSV-1 infection does not appear to affect the rate of HSV-2 acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>However, HSV-1 has been associated with an increasing proportion of cases of genital herpes infection, especially among young women and men who have sex with men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/3,5,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,15-17</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over a two-year follow-up of 1427 HIV-seronegative MSM in Australia, incidence rates for HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection were 5.9 and 1.5 cases per 100 person-years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The rate of infection for HSV-1 was more than twice the rate for HSV-2 (2.5 versus 1.1 per 100 person-years, respectively). HSV-1 was more common than HSV-2 as a cause of genital mucosal infections. </p><p/><p>It is estimated that the majority of genital herpes infections are transmitted by persons unaware that they have the infection, or are asymptomatic when transmission occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As an example, in a population-based cross-sectional survey of adults living in New York City, nearly 28 percent were infected with HSV-2 and 88 percent had no prior knowledge of their diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In a prospective study of 199 patients with newly acquired HSV genital infection, the median duration of the sexual relationship was 3.5 months (range 1.5 to 10 months) and the median number of sex acts before transmission was 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Condom use was infrequent (50 percent during first intercourse; 20 percent during last intercourse before diagnosis). The median time to infection was greater in participants whose partners informed them that they had genital herpes than in those whose partners did not (270 versus 60 days).</p><p>Transmission may also occur during periods of subclinical viral shedding (eg, when symptoms are absent).

The initial presentation can be severe with painful genital ulcers, dysuria, fever, tender local inguinal lymphadenopathy, and headache. In other patients, however, the infection is mild, subclinical, or entirely asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/12,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19</a>]. There are no clear differences in clinical presentation based on infecting virus (ie, HSV-1 versus HSV-2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The average incubation period after exposure is four days (range two to twelve days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In one review, patients with primary infections usually had multiple, bilateral, ulcerating, pustular lesions which resolved after a mean of 19 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Dysuria can lead to reluctance to void because of the passage of acidic urine on open and inflamed vesicles; this is best managed with Sitz baths. However, acute urinary retention with loss of sacral sensation can occur due to lumbosacral radiculomyelitis secondary to severe primary HSV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This complication is transient, but usually requires catheterization until clinical improvement ensues. </p><p>Primary genital herpes is commonly associated with viremia; of 164 adults with confirmed primary genital HSV infection, 40 (24 percent) had HSV DNA detected in plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

In a systematic review that included 10 studies, the sensitivity and specificity of the most commonly used tests were estimated to be 99 and 81 percent, respectively; assuming the prevalence of HSV-2 is 16 percent, the positive predictive value would be 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic tests for HSV-1 cannot differentiate oral from genital infection. </p><p/><p>Given these limitations, and the lack of specific treatment interventions for asymptomatic individuals, the anxiety and disruption of personal relationships that can be associated with a positive test result outweigh the potential benefits of screening.</p><p>A more detailed discussion of the epidemiology and transmission of HSV are described above.

Although HSV-2 has historically been the main causative agent for the preponderance of virologically confirmed infections, HSV-1 is associated with an increasing proportion of cases of genital herpes. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical designations of genital HSV infection are: primary, nonprimary first episode, and recurrent infection. Primary infection refers to infection in a patient without preexisting antibodies to either HSV-1 or HSV-2. Nonprimary first episode infection refers to the acquisition of genital HSV-1 in a patient with preexisting antibodies to the alternate serotype. Recurrent infection refers to reactivation of genital HSV in which the HSV type recovered in the lesion is the same type as those seen on serologic testing. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Types of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transmission of HSV may occur quickly in new sexual relationships. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of primary genital HSV infection are highly variable. The initial presentation can be severe with painful genital ulcers and constitutional symptoms; in other patients, the infection may be mild or entirely asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonprimary first episode infection is associated with fewer lesions and less systemic symptoms than primary infection, presumably because antibodies against one HSV type offer some protection against the other. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Nonprimary infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical recurrences of genital HSV are common, but are typically less severe than primary or nonprimary infections. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extragenital complications, like aseptic meningitis and urinary retention, occur in a minority of patients who present with primary HSV infection. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Extragenital complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of recurrence depends on the severity and duration of the initial episode, the infecting serotype, and the host. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After resolution of the primary genital HSV infection, asymptomatic intermittent viral shedding has been documented in both men and women in the absence of genital lesions. Subclinical HSV shedding is important since infection can be transmitted unknowingly to susceptible sexual partners and neonates. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Viral shedding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among susceptible sexual partners, there is a greater risk of HSV acquisition with male source partners and in patients without HSV antibodies. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Sex partners'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In immunosuppressed patients, most genital HSV infections occurring in immunosuppressed adults reflect reactivation syndromes. Symptomatic episodes may more severe, frequent, and longer in duration. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressed patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSV-2 genital ulcer disease has been definitively linked to an increased risk for acquisition of HIV-1 infection in regions with high seroprevalence rates of HSV-2 infection. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'HSV-2 and risk of HIV transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HSV infection can be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), viral culture, and type-specific serologic tests. The choice of test varies with the clinical presentation. PCR-based assays or culture are preferred for active genital lesions; serologic testing is the preferred method in patients without active disease. PCR is the most sensitive test available, but is limited by cost. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine screening for HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection by serologic testing is not recommended. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sucato G, Wald A, Wakabayashi E, et al.
